Keep it coming! This is a long fight. The third biopsy yielded genetic results that were, as my doctor called them, rare and interesting. He didn\'t know what to make of them since typically most lung cancers have some relatively well-known mutation like ALK. Nope, mine manifested something called FANCG (𝑐.1642𝐶&gt;𝑇, 𝑝.𝑅548*) – 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑐 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 1–2, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐) and RET (𝑐.1063+11𝑑𝑒𝑙𝐶) – 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑈𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 3, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐). While ChatGPT gave me some mixed hope with FANCG, my doc let me know that it\'s nothing that could really be actionable. RET, well, this mutation was more like . . . well . . . not much research has been done with it, so, good luck?</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: My doctor felt like I was still a good candidate for Immunotherapy and specifically a lung cancer trial turned lung cancer treatment called Checkmate 9LA (it was approved for use about 5 years ago or so). This will wrap in the immunotherapies known as ipilimumab and nivolumab alongside chemo. If it works, it has double the chance of sending my cancer into remission as my chemo did.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI=w360-h640" width="360" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>"HERE\'S TOMMY!"</i></div></i><p></p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I\'m legitimately terrified of moving on by adding immunotherapy to my chemotherapy regimen.

Keep it coming! This is a long fight. The third biopsy yielded genetic results that were, as my doctor called them, rare and interesting. He didn\'t know what to make of them since typically most lung cancers have some relatively well-known mutation like ALK. Nope, mine manifested something called FANCG (𝑐.1642𝐶&gt;𝑇, 𝑝.𝑅548*) – 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑐 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 1–2, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐) and RET (𝑐.1063+11𝑑𝑒𝑙𝐶) – 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑈𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 3, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐). While ChatGPT gave me some mixed hope with FANCG, my doc let me know that it\'s nothing that could really be actionable. RET, well, this mutation was more like . . . well . . . not much research has been done with it, so, good luck?</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: My doctor felt like I was still a good candidate for Immunotherapy and specifically a lung cancer trial turned lung cancer treatment called Checkmate 9LA (it was approved for use about 5 years ago or so). This will wrap in the immunotherapies known as ipilimumab and nivolumab alongside chemo. If it works, it has double the chance of sending my cancer into remission as my chemo did.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI=w360-h640" width="360" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>"HERE\'S TOMMY!"</i></div></i><p></p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I\'m legitimately terrified of moving on by adding immunotherapy to my chemotherapy regimen. I read too much about it online, and I don\'t like the odds for developing an auto-immune disorder from this amazing cancer killing method. I guess it really comes down to a "would you rather" type of question: Would you rather have a chance of living the rest of your life with an auto-immune disorder or simply dying with cancer? I\'ll take being alive, please. Most people are fine, but you are rolling the dice. (is a hard +1 Constitution Saving throw for my D&amp;D friends)</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I just got back from an amazing lunch at Santorini\'s Greek Restaurant at Farmington Station. My good friend Colleen bought me lunch, but only after she and my other hard-working buddies, Mandy and Hannah, entertained me through 3 hours of infusion at the Huntsman Center there in Farmington. My friends are calling themselves "Team Tom" and I am truly humbled by the love, kindness, and example they\'ve shown me today. I have often said how lucky I am to have strong female role models -- my wife, my relatives, and good friends like these. So many kind and loving women in my life. Seriously! I feel blessed!

I forget how blessed I am, and I end up sighing to the rafters in my bedroom, cursing the cancer inside of me and how stupid it all feels. How dumb I feel for having cancer. How much inconvenience it causes. The pain of it all. How it feels to be worlds apart from my fat-and-happy-Tom-days in Texas. I had it so good for so many years, how did I end up with this stupid crap in my lungs and back in Utah? I sometimes make the joke that I\'m "Stage 4 at JT4" at my job here in Utah and I used to be "Fat and Happy Tom" in Texas . . . you know, just making, promoting, and playing games. THE LIFE! No, no . . . I am blessed. It\'s just hard to see it sometimes, and that\'s just one of my many failings. Thank you, role models!</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I was able to have some complimentary music therapy from the Huntsman Institute!&nbsp; My social worker turned me on to a really cool benefit (if you can say there\'s a silver lining to having lung cancer) where I can get 6 sessions of music therapy. I sat down with Indigo and an intern and basically talked about my entire music history. (by the way, if you\'re interested and have a half hour of time to read it, you\'re welcome to read more here: <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/08/music-history.html">https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/08/music-history.html</a>). I truly want to write an album of music called "Cosmic Radiation and Bad Luck," named after what my doctor said was the most likely cause of my cancer. I know two tracks that I want on it for sure. (I\'m in the process of adding to a Spotify inspiration song list for the general vibe I want to go for: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1JGD472Z10LK5Zi77A59IL">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1JGD472Z10LK5Zi77A59IL</a>)</p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I waste too much time playing video games to write music -- I should probably stop doing that, but man is <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening">Dune Awakening</a> fun to play lately! I also dropped $12 bucks on a humble bundle deal that supplied me with 16 games that I\'ve never played before. I\'m doomed. (Not to mention all the great shows I still need to watch on Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Apple+, Prime, and on and on) It\'s nice to have so many distractions. First world problems at its best.</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: Speaking of video game distractions, I\'ve started reskinning my 1up machine to look like an honest to goodness Ghosts n\' Goblins machine!

COVID and a quarantined reality solidly hit everyone in 2020. I was staying home and with extra time on my hands. My buddy at work had a group named Bueno Sueno and they had just released a song called Lost in the Shine. I convinced him to send me the stems and flexed my remixing muscles with a mix I called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgtQu2zECs">Tom Purdue Shimmer Mix</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That remix set off a bug in me, and I started remixing or remaking some deep cut songs that were meaningful to me in one way or another. Before I knew it, I had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vWqp7YBZE&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHpgc58cpOgeOQY7F_nR3h9S">whole playlist of remixes and remakes on YouTube</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Cetu Javu\'s Fight Without a Reason (Lifestyle Remix)</li><li>Morrissey\'s Now My Heart is Full (Bunny Love Remix)</li><li>Cabaret Voltaire\'s Code (Wah Guitar Mix)</li><li>The Cure\'s Night Like This (Deeper Still Mix)</li><li>Decussion Council\'s (yes, my old high school band) Don\'t Stop (Everyone Hang On Mix)</li><li>Tom Purdue\'s Bit by Bit (2020 Mix)</li></ul><p></p><p>I wrote about all of them in&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2020/06/mixtape-fire-my-past-month-in-flames.html">this blog post from June 2020</a>. As mentioned in that blog post, I formulated a plan to release a lathe print vinyl record with a very small print run . . . 4-5 copies through a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://americanvinylco.com/product-category/one-off-and-short-run-vinyl-records/">American Vinyl</a>. When I got the records back, I thought they sounded horrible. I hadn\'t mixed the songs considering volume levels and how they would actually play on a record player. I threw them in the garbage can in disgust.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, who is much smarter than me, saved them out of the garbage can and instead stashed them in a secret spot that I would only find later when we were moving from Texas back to Utah. (which . . . is a story all unto itself.) Turns out it was mostly the fault of our bad record player at the time. There were a few sub-bass hits on the Don\'t Stop mix that were just too low and distorted a bit, but that\'s it. The record sounds great.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/s4000/20240406_195749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/w185-h400/20240406_195749.jpg" width="185" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Not the white album, it\'s a Quarantined Mix Record from Tom Purdue!</i></p><p>For real though, the life as a rock star wannabe had become nothing more than a dusty, distant 30-year-old memory up until 2021 when a great guy named Adam Terry contacted me over Instagram holding both my Darkest America and Freeze tapes from back in 1990.

With Adam\'s help, the hope of actually releasing some old music of mine on his label,&nbsp;<a href="https://fountainavm.com/">FountainAVM</a>, was now a possibility! He asked to hear more of my stuff and I flooded his Dropbox with hours upon hours of old music I had recorded on tape.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s1910/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s320/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" width="251" /></a></div><br /><p>Adam was fantastic! I\'ve never had anyone dump so many hours of their life just dedicated to listening to my music. Honestly, the real help from Adam has been feeling like someone actually cared about me as an artist enough to reach out and help me dust off the old tapes. While there may be a lot of sadness and regret from the past, his simple act of reaching out kind of unplugged so many things that I had bottled up over the years. That alone was appreciated.</p><p>From all that, Adam curated two albums of music.&nbsp; The first was just released last year. <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2024/03/an-ant-survives-rainstorm.html">As discussed in this post</a>:</p><p><i>"My new "old" album was released today by FOUNTAINavm.

MOST of them. A couple songs had been lost to time, and we just made do with the old recordings we had.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Adam curated an interesting selection that\'s different from my usual sound. I\'m happy with the result. I\'ve enjoyed riding around in my car late at night listening to An Ant Survives A Rainstorm and hope you would too.</i></p><p><i>Thanks to FOUNTAINavm for releasing this music and thanks for listening!"</i></p><p>While discussing old music with Adam, we also started discussing new music (well new music to me), and he turned me on to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6R1cNisR3xvk0ivHz13P6E">Minimalist Wave Tapes</a> project, so I started listening to it plus some old formative, meaningful music to me from the 70\'s - 90\'s like Kraftwerk, Boards of Canada, Yaz, Thompson Twins, and the Psychedelic Furs. After baptizing myself in all this music and having recently remade Bit by Bit for my Quarantined Mixes, I realized I could make a synthwave album of my own.</p><p>The end result was Red Pinto Hatchback, released in 2021. I actually made two posts about this one. One about the making of <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/09/red-pinto-hatchback-cover-art.html">the cover art</a>, and one <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/10/red-pinto-hatchback-launched.html">about the album release itself</a>. As I stated in that post:</p><p><i>". . . So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette.

It\'s a gritty industrial piece that features the synth work of David Kane. Back in 1988 I was watching 120 minutes on MTV when a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DiNYb20WY">Baby Doe Rules</a> by David Kane\'s Decay of the Western Civilization came on, and I recorded it on VHS tape. I asked every record shop I could find in Utah if they had it so I could listen to more, and no one knew what I was talking about.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Eventually I transferred the song off of VHS tape to audio tape so I could listen to it in my car. It was a rare track that no one knew.

COVID and a quarantined reality solidly hit everyone in 2020. I was staying home and with extra time on my hands. My buddy at work had a group named Bueno Sueno and they had just released a song called Lost in the Shine. I convinced him to send me the stems and flexed my remixing muscles with a mix I called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgtQu2zECs">Tom Purdue Shimmer Mix</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That remix set off a bug in me, and I started remixing or remaking some deep cut songs that were meaningful to me in one way or another. Before I knew it, I had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vWqp7YBZE&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHpgc58cpOgeOQY7F_nR3h9S">whole playlist of remixes and remakes on YouTube</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Cetu Javu\'s Fight Without a Reason (Lifestyle Remix)</li><li>Morrissey\'s Now My Heart is Full (Bunny Love Remix)</li><li>Cabaret Voltaire\'s Code (Wah Guitar Mix)</li><li>The Cure\'s Night Like This (Deeper Still Mix)</li><li>Decussion Council\'s (yes, my old high school band) Don\'t Stop (Everyone Hang On Mix)</li><li>Tom Purdue\'s Bit by Bit (2020 Mix)</li></ul><p></p><p>I wrote about all of them in&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2020/06/mixtape-fire-my-past-month-in-flames.html">this blog post from June 2020</a>. As mentioned in that blog post, I formulated a plan to release a lathe print vinyl record with a very small print run . . . 4-5 copies through a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://americanvinylco.com/product-category/one-off-and-short-run-vinyl-records/">American Vinyl</a>. When I got the records back, I thought they sounded horrible. I hadn\'t mixed the songs considering volume levels and how they would actually play on a record player. I threw them in the garbage can in disgust.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, who is much smarter than me, saved them out of the garbage can and instead stashed them in a secret spot that I would only find later when we were moving from Texas back to Utah. (which . . . is a story all unto itself.) Turns out it was mostly the fault of our bad record player at the time. There were a few sub-bass hits on the Don\'t Stop mix that were just too low and distorted a bit, but that\'s it. The record sounds great.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/s4000/20240406_195749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/w185-h400/20240406_195749.jpg" width="185" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Not the white album, it\'s a Quarantined Mix Record from Tom Purdue!</i></p><p>For real though, the life as a rock star wannabe had become nothing more than a dusty, distant 30-year-old memory up until 2021 when a great guy named Adam Terry contacted me over Instagram holding both my Darkest America and Freeze tapes from back in 1990.

With Adam\'s help, the hope of actually releasing some old music of mine on his label,&nbsp;<a href="https://fountainavm.com/">FountainAVM</a>, was now a possibility! He asked to hear more of my stuff and I flooded his Dropbox with hours upon hours of old music I had recorded on tape.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s1910/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s320/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" width="251" /></a></div><br /><p>Adam was fantastic! I\'ve never had anyone dump so many hours of their life just dedicated to listening to my music. Honestly, the real help from Adam has been feeling like someone actually cared about me as an artist enough to reach out and help me dust off the old tapes. While there may be a lot of sadness and regret from the past, his simple act of reaching out kind of unplugged so many things that I had bottled up over the years. That alone was appreciated.</p><p>From all that, Adam curated two albums of music.&nbsp; The first was just released last year. <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2024/03/an-ant-survives-rainstorm.html">As discussed in this post</a>:</p><p><i>"My new "old" album was released today by FOUNTAINavm.

I\'m happy with the result. I\'ve enjoyed riding around in my car late at night listening to An Ant Survives A Rainstorm and hope you would too.</i></p><p><i>Thanks to FOUNTAINavm for releasing this music and thanks for listening!"</i></p><p>While discussing old music with Adam, we also started discussing new music (well new music to me), and he turned me on to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6R1cNisR3xvk0ivHz13P6E">Minimalist Wave Tapes</a> project, so I started listening to it plus some old formative, meaningful music to me from the 70\'s - 90\'s like Kraftwerk, Boards of Canada, Yaz, Thompson Twins, and the Psychedelic Furs. After baptizing myself in all this music and having recently remade Bit by Bit for my Quarantined Mixes, I realized I could make a synthwave album of my own.</p><p>The end result was Red Pinto Hatchback, released in 2021. I actually made two posts about this one. One about the making of <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/09/red-pinto-hatchback-cover-art.html">the cover art</a>, and one <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/10/red-pinto-hatchback-launched.html">about the album release itself</a>. As I stated in that post:</p><p><i>". . . So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette.

I\'ve talked a bit about my wonderful distractions like Hogwarts Legacy and Dune, but really, they are just distractions from what\'s really going on with me. Unfortunately, it\'s because I have an actual health issue that\'s hard for me to talk about. I\'ve been putting it off because who wants to talk about cancer?! Ugh. Is there any good time to talk about cancer? probably not. Here we go.</p><p>About 4-5 months ago, I started having some pretty strong shoulder and back pain. At the time I thought I had done something to my shoulder while going <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/03/catching-up-with-friendly-march-2025.html">axe throwing with my church group</a>. What followed was a month of going to the chiropractor to no avail. After a couple trips to the regular doctor and two x-rays later, my doctor recommended I get a CT scan since I had some fluid on my lungs and things looked "worse."</p><p>After the CT scan review, the doctor let me know I had about five masses in my left lung, and one of them looked cancerous. We scheduled a PET scan and sure enough, my left lung lit up like a Christmas tree.</p><p>Next up typically would be a biopsy, but I managed to fast track a fluid drain from my lungs at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake, which verified, yes, this is non-small cell Adenocarcinoma in my lungs. Between that fluid analysis and my PET Scan, my oncology team let me know I\'ve been classified with Stage 4 Lung Cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>No one knows how I got it.

I\'m not sure what my decision did or did not do for me since surely I\'ll be playing Risi\'s journey as well, but they gave me an interesting choice.</span><br /><br /><span face="&quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web (West European)&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #242424; font-size: 14.6667px;">The "safe" designer in me wonders why you would ever detach someone from the main quest line, even for a moment.&nbsp; The "creative" designer in me loves the "surprise and delight" moment of even being offered a choice.&nbsp; You definitely don\'t see this same type of choice being offered in AW2 (as far as I remember correctly).&nbsp; Part of me wonders if the metrics showed them that people stopped playing at this area when they did that?&nbsp; It\'s something I\'d love to know just to answer my own curiosity.</span><br /><br /><span face="&quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web (West European)&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #242424; font-size: 14.6667px;">So far in Stikkan\'s follow-on quest, I\'ve unlocked a new wolf companion.&nbsp; He\'s a brutal dual wielder that can howl at magical ice crystals and break them so you can proceed. In this quest, I\'m finding myself swapping back and forth between companions a lot to solve puzzles and break through blocking mechanics. This feels really good in late game.

At the time, my job was to work closely with an outsourcing team in Spain to build a vertical slice of a mobile game called Unnatural Selection (UNS). The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk. When you do find something that works, you can go all in (as they did with our game <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2022/08/game-portfolio-rpg-dice-heroes-of.html">Dice RPG</a>).</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">When I got wind that we were transitioning to VR, I instantly wanted to try making our UNS mobile game as a VR game (UNSVR!). To that end, I drew up a PowerPoint pitch deck and presented it to our executives. They were interested and happy I had taken that initiative, but they wanted something a bit less risky and strange for our first VR project.&nbsp; I can\'t say I blame them!</span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">Below are a few of the slides from that PowerPoint deck:</span></p><p style="color: #222222; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/s1265/deck1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/w640-h356/deck1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/s1280/deck2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/w640-h358/deck2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/s1291/deck3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/w640-h360/deck3.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/s1920/deck5.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/w640-h360/deck5.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/s1296/deck4.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/w640-h360/deck4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Later, in 2023, WIMO hosted a game jam internally and encouraged all teams to make VR games. Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build. Below are a few slides from that Powerpoint.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXhGQaNHO29lWdW1yEdA2ppUMD5o13H1Llhw-2c67OzFsRenXcpI-oawqy_XROPxPky45IREz3Hlh_-M4Jwy4ArCSURfprZnUaYpmOFrNj2HDCG1Vq6cGRiQ6OX8vPCUN7L-J06d8DA0yZLY9WdRaYQ34hvj3bWKO1x63pUwlqwITjF4iw9oKbqiYl0tU/s1375/Screenshot%202025-04-09%20175546.png" style="margin-left: 1em;

At the time, my job was to work closely with an outsourcing team in Spain to build a vertical slice of a mobile game called Unnatural Selection (UNS). The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk. When you do find something that works, you can go all in (as they did with our game <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2022/08/game-portfolio-rpg-dice-heroes-of.html">Dice RPG</a>).</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">When I got wind that we were transitioning to VR, I instantly wanted to try making our UNS mobile game as a VR game (UNSVR!). To that end, I drew up a PowerPoint pitch deck and presented it to our executives. They were interested and happy I had taken that initiative, but they wanted something a bit less risky and strange for our first VR project.&nbsp; I can\'t say I blame them!</span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">Below are a few of the slides from that PowerPoint deck:</span></p><p style="color: #222222; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/s1265/deck1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/w640-h356/deck1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/s1280/deck2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/w640-h358/deck2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/s1291/deck3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/w640-h360/deck3.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/s1920/deck5.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/w640-h360/deck5.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/s1296/deck4.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/w640-h360/deck4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Later, in 2023, WIMO hosted a game jam internally and encouraged all teams to make VR games. Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build.

You know your product development pipeline, and realize that everything in that pipeline is overproduced garbage that nobody wants. You know your management team, and know that none of them had any good business idea for years. Your whole company is built on past glory, trying to wring out the last cent from old products, but unable to produce anything really new. And then you meet a business consortium consisting of a political nepo-baby, and a group of shady but ultra-wealthy investors who clearly have not the slightest clue about the industry you are operating in. You realize, this is your chance! You know your company is a pile of shit with no future, but that is insider knowledge, and not yet obvious to everybody. It is time to give up on your worthless company, sell it for $55 billion to those rich, clueless investors, and retire rich.<div><br /></div><div>I don’t know why everybody is so upset about EA selling itself to a consortium of Trump’s son in law and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. Honestly, if I would own EA, I would have done the same. I would have felt bad if I had sold EA to somebody nice, but selling it to this sort of people feels like morally the right move.

And then you meet a business consortium consisting of a political nepo-baby, and a group of shady but ultra-wealthy investors who clearly have not the slightest clue about the industry you are operating in. You realize, this is your chance! You know your company is a pile of shit with no future, but that is insider knowledge, and not yet obvious to everybody.

Videogames are a bit different: People use other words, like complex, or "difficult to learn", to describe a game like Europa Universalis.

There are no official numbers, but estimates from various sources, based on various data collected by players about players.

Before the release of WoT 2.0, estimated player numbers were down to 2.5 million, and we don\'t have numbers yet how much the new version was able to revive.</div><div><br /></div><div>Declining player numbers not only pose a financial problem to Wargaming, the company running the game. It also poses a financial problem to a number of YouTube channels that have dedicated their channel to World of Tanks content. Fewer players means fewer potential viewers, which means less revenue from content creation. And of course the content creators each have their own idea why World of Tanks is declining, and frequently blame Wargaming for some decision or other. This is also somewhat typical for YouTube: If you run a channel for a game and don\'t frequently criticize the game, you will be seen as a shill. Also the occasional <i>"World of Tanks is dying"</i> sensationalist / controversial video is good for viewer numbers, as controversy gets more clicks than <i>"this is fine"</i> content.</div><div><br /></div><div>So while Wargaming was mostly concerned how to monetize the remaining players, many YouTube channels were complaining about that monetization. That went as far as some channels organizing a "boycott", in which they wouldn\'t review the tanks from loot boxes. Unsurprisingly, Wargaming wasn\'t amused, and removed content creator privileges from the YouTubers complaining the loudest. Which didn\'t make the content on YouTube about World of Tanks any more positive.</div><div><br /></div><div>World of Tanks has, and always had, a slower pace than other online shooters. Especially with heavier tanks at higher tiers and with players using terrain and cover well, a lot of shots simply didn\'t penetrate armor. Which kept tanks alive longer, and led to matches being up to 15 minutes long. Now on the one side, Wargaming felt that a faster game would attract more players. On the other side, Wargaming wanted to sell stuff to players, like premium tanks and premium ammunition. So over the years, power creep occurred: The tanks today penetrate armor a lot more often, due to players using premium "Pay2Win" features. In addition, one of the major changes in World of Tanks 2.0 is an "armor flashlight", that makes it easier for less experienced players to see where the armor of the enemy is weak and can be penetrated.</div><div><br /></div><div>Between that, and the drive to get players back, or new players into the game, veterans of World of Tanks aren\'t happy: Too many people in a typical battle aren\'t very experienced, and play in a more YOLO style, which has become more viable due to that power creep. Thus battles are now much faster, often last only around 5 minutes, and feel very different to the more careful style the veterans are used to. Thus an increasing number of World of Tank content creators are just ranting about the game these days, which doesn\'t really help to promote it, and contributes to the downward spiral. Which also reduces their own viewer numbers. A video 5 years ago from Quickybaby about the best starting tech tree got 692k views, while an equivalent video from 2 weeks ago about which free tech tree to pick only got 255k views. It is pretty obvious that the World of Tanks ecosystem is not in a good shape. The game company and the content creators all make a lot less money than a few years ago, and often blame each other for that.</div><div><br /></div><div>Undoubtedly related to declining player numbers and the resulting matchmaking problems is the fact that World of Tanks today has a lot more PvE parts than it had 5 years ago, when I played last. Today, unless you turn it off, your first battles every day are PvE battles against bots. And why would you turn that off, when you are more likely to win against bots than against real players, and you get full credits and xp for those wins, they just don\'t affect ranking. There are also a number of PvE events, and a badly defined "new player protection mode", in which new players are again more likely to face bots as enemies, or other newer players, and are protected from "seal clubbing", as the practice of veteran players farming new players for xp and credits was known.</div><div><br /></div><div>But while the increase of PvE actually makes World of Tanks more attractive to me, I don\'t think I will play WoT 2.0 a lot.

Fate is a board game by designer Matt Leacock. Matt got his breakthrough in the board game industry with Pandemic, and has since then made several board games that are variations of the Pandemic system. Z-Man Games even created a trademark for <a href="https://www.zmangames.com/universe/pandemic-system/" target="_blank">Pandemic System</a> games, and added some more games not designed by Matt. There are Pandemic System games with a World of Warcraft theme, a Fall of Rome theme, a Dutch dikes themes, a Cthulhu theme, and Star Wars theme, and now Fate joins them as a Pandemic System game with a The Lord of the Rings theme. So I wasn\'t too impressed on hearing this game being announced, it sounded a lot like yet another milking of the same old cash cow. Then I got to play the game at a board game night, and my attitude changed. I even rushed out to buy a copy.<div><br /></div><div>So, what is the Pandemic System? All games with this system are cooperative board games, where the players together struggle to hold back a growing threat. After every player move, some enemy cards are revealed that make bad things happen. If players aren\'t efficient enough to fight the threats faster than they appear, things go downhill quickly. As a special twist, at some points in the game the already played enemy cards are shuffled and put back on the <b>top</b> of the enemy deck. Which means that some enemy cards you\'ll see repeatedly, concentrating the threat locally, and others not at all.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fate adds a new twist to this system: The enemy (shadow) cards now have two different backs. When you turn over the top shadow card, the back of the next card tells you whether to apply the effect on the top or the bottom. Bottom effects put shadow troops (think orcs) into play, bottom effects move those troops in the direction of some haven. This makes the new system slightly more varied than the standard Pandemic System, and Fate just might be the best Pandemic game just from a pure game mechanics point of view.</div><div><br /></div><div>But the reason I would really recommend Fate as a board game is the theme. Which means that my recommendation is addressed to anybody who has at least a decent knowledge of The Lord of the Rings, either by having read the books, or by having seen the films, or ideally both. We played Fate once with a guy who had no clue who Gandalf was, and he still had fun, but there is a huge amount of additional fun to have if you are somewhat knowledgeable of Tolkien\'s work. On the one side, the growing threat produced by the improved Pandemic System is a perfect fit for the growing threat of Sauron in The Lord of the Rings. Also the group being split up all over the map of Middle Earth is an obvious fit to the story. On the other side of things, the game cleverly references the memorable scenes of the books / movies by turning them into quests. On my first game, I was playing Gandalf the Grey, and I had to go to Moria, confront the Balrog, and come back as Gandalf the White. There is a good selection of different quests for different characters, only Frodo having to throw the One Ring into Mount Doom is always the final quest to win the game. Playing Fate feels a lot like The Lord of the Rings, the theme is extremely well integrated into gameplay, and if you like the theme, it adds a lot to the fun of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship costs about $80, or slightly cheaper at €65 in Europe. That makes it a lot cheaper than many of the crowdfunded games I own, but still relatively expensive compared to other retail games. My main point of criticism of the game is that it includes a cardboard dice tower; that adds a lot to table presence, but it is somewhat fiddly to put together, and you have to partially disassemble it to put it back into the box. As you often only throw 3 dice or less, it seems like an unnecessary cost element to me, although some other people absolutely love that thing. I like that the characters are screen printed on wooden pieces instead of being plastic miniatures. The allied and shadow troops are a bit on the small side. But kudos to Asmodee, who without fuzz agreed to send me a replacement for a damaged dwarven troop in my copy of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>Personally I like the cooperative nature of Fate, and its variability. But there being no hidden information opens the game up to the risk of one alpha gamer trying to boss around everybody else at the table to do what he says. Fate needs cooperation, but one needs to balance that with the need for player agency. I guess it depends very much on your gaming group. A group that is working very well together can potentially play Fate at a higher player count of 4 or 5; for most groups 2 or 3 players is probably safer. Also a matter of personal preference is your acceptance of luck in a game. Random characters having to do random quests means that different games can be very different in difficulty; the random nature of the shadow cards can also produce spikes of difficulty, or just ruin your plans by a bad luck draw. On the positive side, this keeps Fate very interesting, you aren\'t going to get to a situation where you feel you have already won only half way through the game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'Winning the award for the board game with the most unwieldy title this year, I\'ll call&nbsp;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/436217/the-lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-fellowship" target="_blank">The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</a> just Fate for the rest of this post.

On the positive side, this keeps Fate very interesting, you aren\'t going to get to a situation where you feel you have already won only half way through the game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/5484888468973093854/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/5484888468973093854', 'title': '0 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5484888468973093854'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5484888468973093854'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-lord-of-rings-fate-of-fellowship.html', 'title': 'The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '0'}

They envision a future with elements from films like The Terminator, or A Space Odyssey, where AI becomes self-aware, super-intelligent, and intent on oppressing or wiping out humans. I don\'t think any of that will happen during my lifetime, armed robots simply aren\'t really a thing yet. In 2025 there is a possibility, albeit a small one, that you get killed by an AI-driven car. But we don\'t even have enough data, enough widespread adoption, and enough standardized AI driving technology that we could even say whether an AI driver kills more or less people than a human driver. The large language model generative AI from software like ChatGPT can kill people indirectly by causing mental harm, e.g. encouraging suicide, but that is still very far from a Terminator future.<div><br /></div><div>In the medium term, a much more realistic fear of AI is that of a disruption of the jobs market through artificial intelligence. The nature of work will change somewhat if companies move towards a wider adoption of AI. New jobs will emerge, but some old jobs will disappear. If you never heard anybody describing his job as "Vibe Coding Cleanup Specialist", that is because that job didn\'t exist before AI. Today it does, but the company hiring him is probably hiring fewer regular coders.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe there is a much bigger short term risk of AI, but I will have to precede my thoughts with a "this is not financial advice" disclaimer. Stock markets are at an all time high. The S&amp;P 500 is now over 40% tech stocks, and most of those tech stocks are heavily invested in artificial intelligence. There is at least a non-zero probability that there is an AI bubble, that investors overestimated the gains companies can make with AI over the coming years, and that the bubble could burst when these gains don\'t get realized as fast as they thought. How does that work?</div><div><br /></div><div>What one needs to understand is the concept of market capitalization, market cap for short. For example Nvidia has&nbsp;24.4 billion shares outstanding, and these shares today trade at $177.75. If you multiply these two numbers, you get the Nvidia market cap of $4.3 trillion. The problem with the concept is that this is imaginary money. It would be impossible to exchange 24.4 billion shares of Nvidia for $4.3 trillion in cash, because the act of selling Nvidia shares would make the share price drop. The same is true for every other share. As long as more people want to buy these shares than there are for sale, stock prices rise. As soon as people want to sell and cash in, stock prices drop. If you bought Nvidia shares on January 1st 2023 for under $15 and sell them now for $177, you made a huge profit. If you buy Nvidia shares for $177 now, and in a year the stock price dropped by half, you would lose money on selling.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fundamentally, stock prices are correlated to what investors think the future of a company will look like. Recently OpenAI made a deal with Oracle to invest $300 billion in AI data centers built by Oracle. This raised the stock price of Oracle, but also of Nvidia, where Oracle would buy the chips for those data centers. If everything in this deal happens as announced, Oracle and Nvidia are expected to have higher revenue, and thus their stock prices rose on an expectation of that. But the future is uncertain, and this optimistic expectation of the future might just be plain wrong. OpenAI is actually losing money every year, and the $300 billion would have to come from investors. And then there is the practical difficulty of buying and powering that many data centers in just a few years. Once Nvidia has made the chips, sold them to Oracle, and Oracle has built the data centers, OpenAI still needs to figure out how to turn that $300 billion investment into a profitable revenue stream. With AI adoption by non-tech companies apparently slowing down, all that future profit isn\'t obvious.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe that stock markets are failing to price in the unintended consequences of the AI boom. For example, a lot of Americans have noticed their electricity prices going up, especially in regions where data centers have been built. Electricity is a regionally traded commodity, and if a lot of new electricity consumers go live, supply doesn\'t go up as fast as demand, and prices generally rise. That is a problem for AI data center owners, but also of all other industry using electricity, and of regular households.</div><div><br /></div><div>Another "unintended" consequence of AI is more unemployment. Where do the stock markets think the profits from AI will ultimately come from? The most straightforward way for a general company to make money with AI is to replace people by it, paying less for an "AI worker" than for the person who did the same job before. But if everybody has "lower labor cost", it also means that a lot of people are unemployed or earn a lot less. And these people are the customers for the companies on the stock market. We already see companies like McDonalds struggling because many of their customers are lower income households, and can\'t afford fast food anymore. If you directly translate aggregate lower labor cost into aggregate lower consumer spending, the future for some companies on the stock market looks a lot less rosy. Those aren\'t necessarily the same companies, e.g. Oracle does very little business with low income households. But right now a glorious AI future, whether it will happen or not, has already been priced into the stock price of the companies that might gain from it, and not yet into the stock price of the companies that would be at the losing end of that deal. I don\'t see McDonalds replacing a lot of its staff by AI, as AI isn\'t yet very good at flipping burgers.</div><div><br /></div><div>Investor optimism leads to overpriced stocks.&nbsp;"Irrational exuberance" in the words of Alan Greenspan. The price to earnings ratio of Nvidia is over 50, that of Oracle over 75. The historical average P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is between 10 and 20.&nbsp;Current S&amp;P 500 PE Ratio is over 30. So the most short term risk from artificial intelligence is not some version of the Terminator, but what is politely called a "stock market correction", where investors realize that AI isn\'t going to pay out *that* fast, and stock prices drop a lot, because suddenly more people are trying to sell their overpriced AI shares than there are people wanting to buy them. And that also affects people who simply invested in ETFs, or who have money in a 401k pension plan. That is not to say that AI isn\'t a technology that will make money in the future, it just might take longer, or the profits will go to different companies than investors think today. Just like the dot com bubble burst, and the internet is doing fine, the AI bubble can burst while AI still has a bright future.

Especially games that don\'t just sell on artistic appeal, but on gameplay. We don\'t need to live in a world where half of the indie games are using pixel art. And I am sure that generative AI could also be used to turn interesting art from human artists into video game animations at much lower cost than today. I would rather see games competing on their merits on platforms like Steam without the gatekeeping of big budget artwork.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/6126267731058331676/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/6126267731058331676', 'title': '3 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6126267731058331676'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6126267731058331676'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-gatekeeping-of-big-budgets.html', 'title': 'The gatekeeping of big budgets'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '3'}

Not the chance to get struck by lightning, it is around that number, although it obviously depends a lot on where and how you live. A link between carrying a mobile phone and getting cancer has been discussed, but the chance to get cancer is higher than the chance to get struck by lightning, and the possible increase to that chance is so low as to be considered not scientifically proven. Right now, in the EU official classification, mobile phones are in the same category of increased cancer risk as pickles.

This week in the news is a possible link between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and the child being born with autism. In the United States the probability of a child being born with autism is estimated to be 1 in 36. That is certainly higher than a century ago, but it is unclear whether this is due to external factors like Tylenol, or simply to an increased awareness of autism. Now there are scientific studies that link Tylenol to autism, and there are scientific studies that show no such link. Just as there are scientific studies that link glyphosate to&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and there being scientific studies that show no such link.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The difference now being that these things have been politicised, and in the USA a Republican would be more likely to believe in the link between Tylenol and autism, while a Democrat would be more likely to believe in the link between glyphosate and&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It should be obvious that this isn\'t how probability or science works. But humans are notoriously bad with probabilities. And thus anything that science would consider to be an event of low probability can find its way into our belief systems. If you thought my example of a mobile phone getting you struck by lightning was ridiculous, how about the belief that it was your sins that would get you struck by lightning? That was pretty wide spread in humanity over many different cultures and religions. And our belief systems are evolving away from being religious to being political. Especially in two-party systems like the USA, party affiliation today has a stronger influence on what you believe to be true than your religious affiliation.</div><div><br /></div><div>For all questions of "does product X causes undesirable outcome Y", I would urge you to consider that whatever you read might be a result of political bias. You still should ask the relevant scientific question of how high the probability of undesirable outcome X is with and without product X. How strong or weak is the link? If the probability is relatively high to start with, and increases only by a small amount, how justified would it be to sue the producer of product X for damages? Although in a legal system where the probability of getting over 1 million dollars in a lawsuit is higher than the probability of winning 1 million dollars in the lottery, scientific proof is maybe the last thing you want.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'Imagine that your probability of getting struck by lightning is 1 in a million in a given year.

Just as there are scientific studies that link glyphosate to&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and there being scientific studies that show no such link.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The difference now being that these things have been politicised, and in the USA a Republican would be more likely to believe in the link between Tylenol and autism, while a Democrat would be more likely to believe in the link between glyphosate and&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It should be obvious that this isn\'t how probability or science works. But humans are notoriously bad with probabilities. And thus anything that science would consider to be an event of low probability can find its way into our belief systems. If you thought my example of a mobile phone getting you struck by lightning was ridiculous, how about the belief that it was your sins that would get you struck by lightning? That was pretty wide spread in humanity over many different cultures and religions. And our belief systems are evolving away from being religious to being political. Especially in two-party systems like the USA, party affiliation today has a stronger influence on what you believe to be true than your religious affiliation.</div><div><br /></div><div>For all questions of "does product X causes undesirable outcome Y", I would urge you to consider that whatever you read might be a result of political bias. You still should ask the relevant scientific question of how high the probability of undesirable outcome X is with and without product X. How strong or weak is the link? If the probability is relatively high to start with, and increases only by a small amount, how justified would it be to sue the producer of product X for damages? Although in a legal system where the probability of getting over 1 million dollars in a lawsuit is higher than the probability of winning 1 million dollars in the lottery, scientific proof is maybe the last thing you want.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/4166210046328438336/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/4166210046328438336', 'title': '6 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/4166210046328438336'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/4166210046328438336'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/science-probability-and-political-bias.html', 'title': 'Science, probability and political bias'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '6'}

In the first story mission we ended up in a situation where we were boxed in and couldn\'t move, and as it took several rounds to kill an enemy we had a series of rather boring turns. The second and third story mission we both lost, and couldn\'t replay because of the fail forward system. In both those mission the objective tokens were randomly distributed on the map, and we just had bad luck of them being in the worst possible spots in both cases.

It does not help you to know that at the start of EU4 it is a possible strategy to give away all your crownland to the estates in exchange for one monarch point per category per month, as EU5 doesn\'t even have monarch points. It is very likely that EU5 will have some systems in place that address the same fundamentals, e.g. a system that prevents you from having too many alliances.

Games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild / Tears of the Kingdom have relatively open worlds, but still provide the player with a clear path of progression and a main story line. That might actually be an optimum. If you get much more open, the player is increasingly likely to feel somewhat lost and aimless. It is a lot easier to follow a set of goals that is prescribed by the game than to set your own goals and follow those.<div><br /></div><div>I very much like the board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420033/vantage" target="_blank">Vantage</a> that recently came out. Having a lot of fun playing that occasionally with my wife, played some solo, and brought it several times to board game night. But Vantage sure isn\'t for everybody. Dice Tower made a video review, in which 2 of the 4 reviewers rated it very highly, while the 2 others didn\'t want to play that game again. As a game in which you follow the goals set by the game to win, Vantage doesn\'t work very well. It is more of a very open sandbox game in which you have to pursue your own goals, and the missions and destinies are just sprinkled in as optional content. If you get the concept of "winning" out of your head, Vantage becomes a much better game.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was thinking about that when reading the Reddit discussion on Europa Universalis V. One of the big changes from EU4 to EU5 is that the mission trees that are currently in EU4 have been abandoned. People liked the mission trees, because they provided a clear path to victory. On the one side they gave you specific goals to pursue, on the other side they rewarded you with bonuses, often in the form of permanent claims, that helped you on the way to the next goal. The downside of that is that the mission tree turns a country into a nearly linear experience towards winning the game. And winning Europa Universalis isn\'t much fun to begin with.</div><div><br /></div><div>I recently had a very weird game in which I wanted to try to play France for the first time. But having played countries nearby, and watched some videos, I was well aware of the two major events that happen to France, and the French mission tree. So by maximum use of the advance knowledge and a bit of luck I first exploited the Surrender of Maine event to crush England, and then finagled my way into the Burgundian Succession. Then when the Holy Roman Empire demanded the lowlands, I refused, and crushed Austria. Shortly after Marie of Burgundy had her "riding accident" event, and Burgundy got integrated into France. I also integrated all the apanages. Before I even reached the year 1500, my main problem was that the game couldn\'t find any other rival than Spain for me, I had simply grown too strong too fast. I stopped playing, because it got boring. I know that some people play EU4 with a goal of world conquest, but once you are already the strongest nation, that is just boring to me. I might play France again and just pretend I don\'t know about the events that will happen with England and Burgundy.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the EU4 mission trees telling you how to win and helping you with it, the devs from Paradox decided to not provide such a clear path towards victory for the countries in Europa Universalis V. From all I see, I believe that EU5, like Vantage, will best played without thinking of winning. It could be a lot of fun as an alternative history simulation game. But the different countries you can choose are clearly not equally strong, and very soon people will learn how to conquer the world, especially when starting with a stronger nation. I\'m not sure that will be fun to me, I don\'t rate the combat system of Europa Universalis high enough that I would want to play it as a war game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'A lot of games which people think of as being sandboxes in fact aren\'t. Games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild / Tears of the Kingdom have relatively open worlds, but still provide the player with a clear path of progression and a main story line. That might actually be an optimum. If you get much more open, the player is increasingly likely to feel somewhat lost and aimless. It is a lot easier to follow a set of goals that is prescribed by the game than to set your own goals and follow those.<div><br /></div><div>I very much like the board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420033/vantage" target="_blank">Vantage</a> that recently came out. Having a lot of fun playing that occasionally with my wife, played some solo, and brought it several times to board game night. But Vantage sure isn\'t for everybody. Dice Tower made a video review, in which 2 of the 4 reviewers rated it very highly, while the 2 others didn\'t want to play that game again. As a game in which you follow the goals set by the game to win, Vantage doesn\'t work very well. It is more of a very open sandbox game in which you have to pursue your own goals, and the missions and destinies are just sprinkled in as optional content. If you get the concept of "winning" out of your head, Vantage becomes a much better game.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was thinking about that when reading the Reddit discussion on Europa Universalis V. One of the big changes from EU4 to EU5 is that the mission trees that are currently in EU4 have been abandoned. People liked the mission trees, because they provided a clear path to victory. On the one side they gave you specific goals to pursue, on the other side they rewarded you with bonuses, often in the form of permanent claims, that helped you on the way to the next goal. The downside of that is that the mission tree turns a country into a nearly linear experience towards winning the game. And winning Europa Universalis isn\'t much fun to begin with.</div><div><br /></div><div>I recently had a very weird game in which I wanted to try to play France for the first time. But having played countries nearby, and watched some videos, I was well aware of the two major events that happen to France, and the French mission tree. So by maximum use of the advance knowledge and a bit of luck I first exploited the Surrender of Maine event to crush England, and then finagled my way into the Burgundian Succession. Then when the Holy Roman Empire demanded the lowlands, I refused, and crushed Austria. Shortly after Marie of Burgundy had her "riding accident" event, and Burgundy got integrated into France. I also integrated all the apanages. Before I even reached the year 1500, my main problem was that the game couldn\'t find any other rival than Spain for me, I had simply grown too strong too fast. I stopped playing, because it got boring. I know that some people play EU4 with a goal of world conquest, but once you are already the strongest nation, that is just boring to me. I might play France again and just pretend I don\'t know about the events that will happen with England and Burgundy.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the EU4 mission trees telling you how to win and helping you with it, the devs from Paradox decided to not provide such a clear path towards victory for the countries in Europa Universalis V. From all I see, I believe that EU5, like Vantage, will best played without thinking of winning. It could be a lot of fun as an alternative history simulation game. But the different countries you can choose are clearly not equally strong, and very soon people will learn how to conquer the world, especially when starting with a stronger nation. I\'m not sure that will be fun to me, I don\'t rate the combat system of Europa Universalis high enough that I would want to play it as a war game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/1327279831478843627/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/1327279831478843627', 'title': '2 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/1327279831478843627'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/1327279831478843627'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/08/sandboxes-vantage-and-eu5.html', 'title': 'Sandboxes, Vantage, and EU5'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '2'}

The game appears (and plays) like an aquatic combination of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/18/coffee-talk-review/">Coffee Talk</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/15/steamworld-dig-2-review/">SteamWorld Dig</a></em>, which are both games I very much enjoy. I downloaded <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> upon release on Switch, but it fell into my backlog until this year; in recent months, I&#8217;ve gotten around to properly playing through the game, and I&#8217;m glad I did so &#8211; not only does it deliver on the rewarding gameplay loop and sumptuous pixel art graphics I hoped for, but it&#8217;s been an ideal showcase for chilled handheld gaming on the Nintendo Switch 2!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting the review, I&#8217;d like to mention the brief controversy around <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, as I remember it adding unfair caution to my approach to the game. Back in 2023, the game was nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards, which drew criticism because the game wasn&#8217;t an Indie game &#8211; the developer MINTROCKET was a subsidiary of Nexon, a lucrative South Korean company. The developers were not responsible for the game being nominated, and it appears that the nomination was based off of the pixel art graphics and relaxed alternative vibe of the game, instead of the literal definition of an independent company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, the CEO of MINTROCKET &#8211; and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> creator &#8211; Jaeho Hwang said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>“I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like a more detailed explanation and opinion, I highly recommend <a href="https://indiecator.org/2023/11/15/why-is-dave-the-diver-not-indie/">this post on <em>Indiecator</em> by MagiWasTaken</a>, which discusses the situation in better detail than I could in this short review introduction. Ironically, it&#8217;s since been announced in 2024 that MINTROCKET is becoming independent (albeit with support from Nexon to carry out the move). My main point is that this controversy is not something to think ill of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> or MINTROCKET for, and that allowed me to dive into the game fresh. Right, that&#8217;s enough preamble, so let&#8217;s get into the review!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Catch of the Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> follows the story of Dave and his friends, who&#8217;ve travelled to the oceanic Blue Hole to set up a sushi restaurant called Bancho Sushi (named after the head chef Bancho). As the title suggests, Dave must dive underwater to collect the fish and ingredients, and this forms the majority of the game &#8211; you must balance risk and reward as you collect as much as Dave can carry, whilst keeping track of your oxygen levels and means to get back to the surface &#8211; either by swimming back up, or finding an Escape Pod point. If you run out of oxygen and get stranded underwater, you lose all but one of your collected items, which severely impacts the success of the sushi restaurant in the evenings. This risk/reward system is reminiscent of the digging in <em>SteamWorld Dig</em>, and is implemented superbly here &#8211; the player has to make the tough decision between keeping what they&#8217;ve got, or risking pushing a little further and potentially losing it all. It&#8217;s a brilliant gameplay loop that keeps you coming back for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15160" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15140" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15139" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The game eases you in gently, starting with introducing the mechanics of catching fish at a relatively shallow depth. Your main weapon is the harpoon, which can be fired in front of you to reel in fish. However, there&#8217;s a delay whilst the fish struggles, which gives other dangerous creatures the time to close in on Dave &#8211; and later on, the harpoon requires multiple hits and/or extra button combinations to capture stronger fish. There are also various items to discover and collect, either as supplementary ingredients found in submerged cooking pots, or as materials scattered on the sea floor. Dave only has a certain amount they can hold at once, which quickly becomes reason to earn the Gold needed for upgrading your Cargo Box storage limit &#8211; as well as your Air Tank, Harpoon Gun, and more. In turn, this motivates the player for the sushi segments of the game; depending on how well the restaurant performs in the evenings, the more Gold you&#8217;ll earn for upgrades. Both sides of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> continue to ingeniously compliment each other in this way, as success in one helps you in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the sushi segments are rather different from the diving, and this is where my earlier comparison to <em>Coffee Talk</em> comes in. After setting sail to Bancho Sushi, you start by going through a list of your possible dishes to serve in your evening menu; your selection is based upon the fish you&#8217;ve caught and the ingredients you&#8217;ve acquired. The quality and quantity of your haul determines your success, as rarer fish open up more expensive dishes that result in a more lucrative evening. Upon selecting each dish, you can also enhance it if you have enough excess ingredients &#8211; a process given extra visual flair by the wonderful animated cutscenes of Bancho preparing the food. These animations aren&#8217;t limited to just Bancho, and are sprinkled throughout <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, such as when weapons expert Duff upgrades your guns. Each of these sequences has a tongue-in-cheek over-exaggerated tone, and add to the playful charm of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15133" height="360" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif?w=640" width="640" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in Bancho Sushi you can browse and sell your ingredients for quickfire Gold, as well as decorate the restaurant as you see fit, and even hire extra members of staff to help you out. The latter are essential, as over time the restaurant gets busier; once you open the restaurant, you control Dave as he serves dishes and maintains the restaurant, and hiring extra hands to help is key to success. Whether it&#8217;s pouring drinks, dashing around to serve sushi plates, cleaning up, or keeping Bancho well-stocked with sushi, this is a frenetic <em>Overcooked</em>-style part of the game that contrasts well with the diving. It&#8217;s certainly not as layered as the underwater gameplay, but it&#8217;s not supposed to be, and does a successful job at giving the player a break between each dive. Plus, it&#8217;s extremely satisfying to see the profits come in &#8211; which can then be spent on upgrades the next day, when the cycle begins anew&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Just Keep Swimming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this core gameplay loop, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> steadily introduces new characters and locations throughout the seven main story chapters. They&#8217;re an eclectic bunch, each with their own expertise and side quests. Archaeologist Dr. Bacon propels the main story forward; as you dive deeper, you discover much more than just fish, including secret civilizations and bigger ecological threats to the Blue Hole &#8211; the latter of which is tracked by the biologist Ellie, who gives you various collection tasks through the Ecowatcher app. Speaking of which, your progress is mostly tracked via these apps, which are accessed via the efficient menu on Dave&#8217;s smartphone. To give a few examples: you might use the phone to acquire and upgrade weapons (with the help of the aforementioned Duff); you might browse your snaps for photographer Udo; or you might look through your Pokémon-style Marinca collection for Sato, an Ash Ketchum lookalike!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15146" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15153" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15154" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between all these characters and side quests, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> has something for everyone. If you like collecting then you can focus on filling out the Marinca (essentially a Pokédex for fish), if you like the sushi-management side you can focus on optimising your earnings, and if you like exploring then you can focus on the diving. Whichever way you play, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> smartly manages to naturally push the story on regardless &#8211; for example, a character named Otto opens a farm partway into the game, where you can grow crops such as rice. Growing these ingredients helps you to reliably create more valuable dishes in the evening; but to help out Otto and subsequently build up the farm, you need to collect certain items, which requires becoming proficient at the diving. Each element of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> gently motivates the others in this way, and therefore pushes the player to test out every facet of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a side effect of this admirable gameplay variety is that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> occasionally inserts under-baked minigames or quick time events. One instance of this is the cooking competition side missions, where you must gather ingredients for Bancho as you normally would, but upon doing so, you must then engage in first-person cooking challenges. These consist of basic button presses and directional inputs, and feel like a rushed version of either a <em>Cooking Mama</em> or <em>Mario Party</em> minigame. It was the rare moment in <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> where I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15123" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15124" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15127" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15136" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, some of these asides work better than others &#8211; a relatively quick soldering minigame is an enjoyable and brief inclusion, and there&#8217;s a compelling <em>Balatro</em>-style card game, but on the other hand, a one-time stealth sequence is particularly badly designed. These hiccups are rare enough that they don&#8217;t significantly detract from <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, but they were also noticeable enough that I had to mention them in this review. They just feel unnecessary &#8211; it&#8217;s as if <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> felt it had to extend itself beyond the main gameplay loop that it executes so superbly. If anything, the high quality of the core diving-and-sushi-selling gameplay only make the brief diversions more jarring.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Deadly Depths</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the various other side missions and gameplay mechanics, it&#8217;s the diving that&#8217;s understandably the focus of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, and it&#8217;s exceptionally well-balanced. As aforementioned, your initial harpoon is a unique weapon to master &#8211; but Dave can also carry one firearm, either by collecting them underwater or by crafting them beforehand. There&#8217;s a range of weapon types: you might use the Net Gun for catching large swathes of fish, or perhaps the Grenade Launcher for explosive damage, or even (my weapon of choice) the Sniper Rifle for long-range damage. The latter is especially handy when tackling sea life that is aggressive at close range, such as the many sharks patrolling the Blue Hole!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15161" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Dave isn&#8217;t just reeling in small fish. You&#8217;ll soon be fighting not only sharks, but hostile jellyfish, giant squids, and plenty more! Significant story events are often accompanied by a boss fight against a dangerous opponent such as these, introduced with stylish freeze frames reminiscent of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and signifying the stakes of the encounter. Additionally, new areas of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> can be a trial by fire, with enemies that suddenly reduce huge amounts of your oxygen supply (which doubles as a health bar of sorts) with a single hit. However, the challenge rarely felt unfair, and any failed dives were always down to my own mistakes &#8211; and only left me more motivated to improve my aquatic skills or upgrade my gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, as well as your harpoon and firearm, Dave can carry a melee weapon (also used for mining materials) and two pieces of equipment. The latter of these can vary, from battle items such as a proximity mine, to ways of helping Dave in a pinch, such as portable oxygen refills. Most of these can be found underwater, or alternatively, they can be pre-purchased from Cobra in the boat before starting your dive, adding another way for the player to customise their approach. Overall, there&#8217;s a well-judged balance between giving the player plenty of options, but not giving you so much power that you can become complacent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15142" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15172" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15168" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when you feel comfortable with Dave and his toolset, the missions being asked of you often cleverly push you out of your comfort zone &#8211; and if you&#8217;re not careful, it doesn&#8217;t take much for a dangerous enemy or perilous area to derail your dive and leave you back at the boat almost empty-handed. It&#8217;s oh-so-easy to fall into the trap of completing just one more mission, collecting just one more item, capturing just one more fish &#8211; but equally, there&#8217;s an undeniable thrill to escaping just in time. In the later chapters, missions become more specific to match your increased skills, and particular ingredients can necessitate repeated captures of rare creatures. This cycle reminded me of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and similarly to that series, provides a tangible reason to keep capturing the most elusive fish &#8211; in this case, to find the rarest ingredients and compose the finest dishes at Bancho Sushi!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Under the Sea</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the endearing yet adventurous nature of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the graphical style; the gorgeous pixel-art invites you in, making diving a little deeper &#8211; and playing a little longer &#8211; even more enticing. The shallow regions are full of bright welcoming colours, but the variety only builds from here. Every layer under the water has a unique visual identity, such as the dark Blue Hole Depths, or the extreme cold and heat of later areas. Meanwhile, night-time dives feature a shining kaleidoscope of colourful foliage that feels magical to navigate &#8211; when you&#8217;re not being pursued by deadly fish, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15162" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the human character designs have a palpable sense of personality. This gets more spotlight in the earlier-mentioned animated cutscenes, which blend the stunning pixel art with the tongue-in-cheek humour that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> does so well. By the end of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, the roster of characters have a real sense of camaraderie between them, which contributes to that overall warm and relaxed feeling that the game has. Add in the detailed multitude of marine species and food recipes, and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> really is a delectably beautiful game. Playing it on the large handheld screen <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/09/09/did-my-hopes-for-the-switch-2-become-a-reality/">of the Switch 2</a> has only accentuated this feeling further for me &#8211; and it&#8217;s been a great example for how that console helps the back catalogue of the original Switch to shine even brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial compliment to the visuals of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the music, which is often a wonderfully soothing backdrop to your deep sea exploration. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a notably therapeutic game when you’re just casually collecting fish, exploring the vast swathes of water, and listening to the delicate musical backdrop. My favourite piece of music is for a late-game frozen area, where these tranquil tones morph into a synth-style inspirational beat. Also, music fans will get an extra treat from a certain cameo appearance at Bancho Sushi, who comes complete with a musical performance that I’ve been listening to many times since! Not to be glossed over is the sound design, too &#8211; the sounds of marine life, the tense pull of a harpoon, the whooshing of waves, it all sounds authentic and distinct, and pulls you further into the watery world of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15163" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15148" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg?w=863" width="863" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15150" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing about this game &#8211; it reels you in, not necessarily in a sudden way, but a gradual one. As the in-game days go by, you settle more thoroughly into the gameplay loop, getting more familiar with characters old and new, until they become familiar friends on your adventure. There&#8217;s a sense of pleasing routine to checking your farms for crops and ingredients, then going diving and completing missions, before then preparing for the evening Bancho Sushi business. It&#8217;s a lot like the charm of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> or <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but with the added element of gripping underwater gameplay to go alongside it. The game is kept fresh by the steady incline of options and equipment available to Dave, and this creates an endgame with potentially endless longevity. Even when you finish all of the main story missions, you still have a restaurant business to run, and you can continue building it out to your hearts content. There&#8217;s extra DLC too, two of which (the <em>Dredge</em> and <em>Godzilla</em> tie-in packs) are free, for those looking for extra content!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a delight to play through <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. The mix of gripping gameplay and relaxing sushi simulation &#8211; combined with the incredible art direction and music &#8211; makes for an RPG full of endearing charm and well-meaning adventure. At its heart is whimsy and a sense of positivity, and that soaks through into every part of the game &#8211; and each part compliments the other in a wonderfully natural way. My only criticism is that this enthusiasm leads to the introduction of impromptu minigames and quick time events that sometimes feel underdeveloped in contrast to the main diving gameplay &#8211; but they&#8217;re few and far between, and a drop in the ocean compared to the sea of brilliance within <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. There&#8217;s brilliant longevity built in too &#8211; even after finishing the main story, the diving and sushi restaurant aspects remain, for those who&#8217;d like to continue building Bancho Sushi into the best restaurant it can be. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a treasure of a game, and it comes highly recommended from me!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center

This particular Direct was split into three distinct segments: first about the 40th Anniversary of Mario, then news for the original Nintendo Switch, and then finally information on the Switch 2 &#8211; and altogether it made for a barnstorming hour-long performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo has been on a run of brilliant Directs over the last few years, but this might genuinely be my favourite one for a long while. Many of the announcements in this Direct speak specifically to me and the games I have been looking forward to, and it&#8217;s genuinely made whittling my choices down to five a tough task! If you&#8217;d like to see the full Nintendo Direct, you can do so below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Honourable Mentions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of it being a tough task&#8230; With so much packed into the Direct, I am first going to run through some other announcements that I was glad or intrigued to see, but didn&#8217;t make the cut for the five announcements that appealed most to me personally. The Nintendo Direct started with several <em>Mario </em>announcements in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary: this included a trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> in 2026, as well as a collection of both <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> games for Nintendo Switch, coming October 2nd this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retrospectively, this does make <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/04/lets-chat-3d-mario-games-are-coming-to-switch-but-where-is-galaxy-2/">the decision not to include <em>Galaxy 2</em> in the <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> collection</a> feel very calculated. I personally will likely pass on this new release of the <em>Galaxy </em>games, as the £58.99 cost (or £33.99 separately) feels excessive &#8211; and whilst they are superb games, I doubt I&#8217;ll play them enough when there are so many other new games to play. I do, however, hope to get the physical <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOor7cl-qF_B_yaH1ketH1_ep2UqAIeMsULytGxbXaJ-8c79YpmKe">Rosalina&#8217;s Storybook</a> they are making, as that would be lovely to keep in the collection!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15028" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15029" height="377" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg?w=670" width="670" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15027" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15026" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we got a release date of 4th December for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was great to have confirmed &#8211; and the only reason it isn&#8217;t in my main five picks below is that the new footage left me a bit hesitant. We got to see the new bike Samus will use to traverse the world, and there was something off about it &#8211; the world looked a bit too empty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The footage reminded me of the infamous Mako in the first <em>Mass Effect</em> game, which was also known for wide open spaces that felt empty and were awkward to navigate. Visually, the bike is very cool, and the first-person segments look fantastic, but I was surprised at the briefness of this new footage. I sincerely hope that isn&#8217;t a sign of a lack of confidence in the game; either way, eight years after the initial announcement, I remain very excited for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> to finally launch!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I&#8217;d like to give a mention to the <em>Pokémon</em> segment of the Direct. We got the announcement of a brand new spin-off game named <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, which looks like a mix between<em> Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>, where you play as a Ditto-turned-human (whether this is charming or horrific, you decide)! This game probably won&#8217;t be for me, but I envisage it being very popular, by blending life-sim mechanics with the popularity of the world of <em>Pokémon</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, we got more info for the soon-to-be-released <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, showing off new Mega Evolutions; this segment ended with an announcement of the upcoming <em>Mega Dimension</em> paid DLC, and this felt quite cynical &#8211; it feels strange to have paid DLC announced before we even have the base game. I&#8217;ll wait and see how that DLC materialises, but for now, I&#8217;m fine not seeing much more about <em>Z-A</em>, as I&#8217;m definitely purchasing the game at launch. From here, the Direct transitioned into the surprise announcement of <em>Danganronpa 2&#215;2</em>, a new version of <em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> with added content! I only relatively recently finished (<a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/09/danganronpa-2-goodbye-despair-review-an-ambitious-beautiful-mess-of-a-sequel/">and reviewed</a>) the original game on Switch, and I really enjoyed it overall, so I&#8217;ll be curious to see how much difference the additions make.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15020" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15024" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15025" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15022" height="338" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg?w=600" width="600" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That was quite a long honourable mentions section, wasn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a result of just how many exciting announcements we received; I finished this Direct feeling very optimistic about the future of the Switch 2, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten into my top five reason why! When there are so many announcements, writing this sort of article helps me process the Direct and focus in on the games I&#8217;m going to prioritise playing, and I hope it is an enjoyable read for you too! Right, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#5: Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the most exciting part of the <em>Mario </em>section of the Direct was the announcement of a brand new Yoshi game, named <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em>! Yoshi side-scrollers have a reputation for charming art directions &#8211; for example <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Woolly World</em> and <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Crafted World</em> &#8211; and this game continues that, with a gorgeous stop-motion visual style bursting with colour and personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot of the game follows Yoshi after the appearance of a peculiar book named Mr. E, with pages detailing mysterious creatures. Yoshi jumps into the book (which is the reason for the storybook graphical style) and meets various new creatures, with the details jotted down into the book as Yoshi does so. Completing the storybook of fantastical creatures is an accompaniment to the charming platforming, and there&#8217;s a palpable sense of warmth and whimsy to it all. This game looks ideal for playing on a rainy weekend, wrapped up warm and enjoying the cosy gameplay. I see <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>being a brilliant experience for all ages of players, and I look forward to playing it myself when it releases in Spring 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#4: Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Direct contained the announcements of release dates for several high-profile previously-announced games, and three of these appear on my list. Starting this off is <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>, the third <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> game after the original and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/05/15/my-to-play-list-may-2023-progress/">Age of Calamity</a></em>, which is confirmed to release on November 6th. Just as the latter of those filled in story gaps for <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, one of the main appeals of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is adding story details for <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. Specifically, the time period that Princess Zelda is sent back to in that game &#8211; and I&#8217;m glad to see this time covered more thoroughly, as it felt to me that Zelda was unfairly side-lined in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as a release date, the new footage showed off playable characters such as Queen Sonia, King Rauru, and a new unnamed Korok character. The gameplay looks like the expected <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-esque combat, but there are some additions, such as Zonai devices and multi-character Sync Strikes that change depending on the character combinations. There&#8217;s also the confirmation of local GameShare multiplayer and splitscreen, and glimpses of many epic visual sequences such as airborne Gleeok battles. I accept that the gameplay will likely be repetitive, but for me the appeal of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games is the visual spectacle and extra lore &#8211; and<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> looks to be delivering on that!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#3: Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the brand new announcements of the Direct was that of a new mainline <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, named <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em>. It&#8217;s been wonderful to see <em>Fire Emblem</em> gradually become a household name in the West, with the 3DS games such as <em>Awakening</em> laying the groundwork for <em>Three Houses</em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/14/a-little-zelda-a-lotta-farming-takeaways-from-the-nintendo-direct/">Engage</a> </em>to be massive hits on Switch. The distinction setting <em>Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart is the gladiator-style Heroic Games, which has a multitude of characters competing for the fulfilled wishes that supposedly reward your victory. At the end of the trailer, we see a tease of Sothis, a character from Three Houses &#8211; so it appears there may be a story connection to that game as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the game looks stunning, with gorgeous anime visuals, and clean turn-based strategy UI design. Part of the appeal of <em>Fire Emblem</em> is the stakes of building character relationships in a world where permadeath is possible, and the gladiatorial setting will hopefully provide a fresh twist to that structure that will set<em> Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart. The trailer has a variety of striking characters, and I&#8217;m looking forward to finding my favourites! For now, we only have a general 2026 release date, so I&#8217;d guess that this game will be one of the major late-year releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#2: Resident Evil: Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think it surprising that I&#8217;ve put two already-announced games above the news of a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game; but that&#8217;s a reflection of my adoration for the franchises these next two games are a part of, and how stoked I am to see additional news about their next instalments. Firstly we have <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, the much-anticipated ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> game (if you don&#8217;t count <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/27/resident-evil-zero-review/"><em>Resident Evil Zero</em></a>). This latest entry stars FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she pursues the truth about a deadly virus and the mystery of her mother&#8217;s death &#8211; a path which leads her to the ruins of Raccoon City. This game had already been announced for other consoles, but this is the formal announcement of a Switch 2 version, which is brilliant to see. On Switch, <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/11/25/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/16/resident-evil-village-review/">Resident Evil Village</a></em> could only be played as Cloud games, but the more conventional release of <em>Requiem </em>shows that the console can (for now, at least) keep up with modern large-scale third-party releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually might play <em>Requiem </em>on Switch 2 &#8211; my only other means would be PC or Xbox Series S, and as someone who likes to collect physical copies of <em>Resident Evil</em> games on console, that makes the Switch 2 version more appealing to me. <em>Requiem </em>is up there as one of my most anticipated games; I adore the <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise, and am eagerly awaiting <em>Requiem</em> to see how they interweave the lore of the series into the story. Other than Chris Redfield, we haven&#8217;t had any of the earlier characters show up in the main series since <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, and with the return to Raccoon City, this feels like an ideal time for some guest appearances of older, more experienced versions of those fan favourites. Grace Ashcroft is also the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character from the lesser-known spin-off <em>Resident Evil Outbreak</em> games, which already shows that Capcom is happy playing with some deep-cut lore. I happen to have bought the two <em>Outbreak</em> games second-hand before <em>Requiem</em> was even announced, and am planning to play them before the launch of <em>Requiem </em>and write up my thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Requiem </em>trailer in the Direct was full of intense visuals, threatening figures, and story hints (such as the iconic Umbrella Corporation logo). It struck me that there&#8217;s an underlying grungy tone waiting to break out, which I&#8217;m very excited to discover. This can even be seen in the logo for <em>Requiem</em>, and the burned-out profile shot of Grace near the end of this new trailer. Right now, the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise is in a very healthy place (as healthy a a series about viral monstrosities can be, anyway), and it&#8217;s given Capcom a resulting confidence that could make this game utterly exceptional. They&#8217;re playing their cards close to their chest, concealing the full extent of the horrors that await us on February 27th&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#1: Hades II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yes, oh yes. This is an announcement fans of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/14/hades-review/">Hades</a></em> and Supergiant Games have been awaiting since the reveal of <em>Hades II</em> back at The Game Awards in 2022, and now it&#8217;s here &#8211; the release date of the official 1.0 version, releasing digitally on Switch and PC on September 25th (and physically on November 20th). The first <em>Hades</em> is a phenomenal roguelike action game that turned many players into fans of the genre, but it was quite a surprise when Supergiant announced a sequel &#8211; not only was the first game utterly jam-packed with content and ideas, but they&#8217;d never done a sequel game before. I&#8217;ve purposefully been avoiding details about the game in Early Access, as I&#8217;d like to go in fresh and see what marvels Supergiant have cooked up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon this could be a <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>/<em>Galaxy 2</em> situation, where the developers have so many ideas and so much creativity to share, that they need a whole other game to fit it all in. This time, we play as the immortal Princess of the Underworld, battling against the Titan of Time and exploring an even larger and deeper mythic world of Olympian Gods. In the Direct, this was visualized with a cutscene that gave me goosebumps from the visual flair on show; Supergiant are known for their sumptuous visuals and music, and that&#8217;s very much still the case here. I&#8217;m eager to dive back into the rich gameplay and gripping story of the world of <em>Hades</em>, reuniting with previous characters (Artemis is back!) and meeting new ones. I honestly didn&#8217;t expect the release date to be so soon, but in less than two weeks we&#8217;ll be able to play the 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> &#8211; discovering new Boons, enemies, locations, and more. Bring it on!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>This Nintendo Direct was sensational, and answered many questions about release dates and upcoming games for the Switch 2 (and Switch) release slate. I&#8217;ve been enjoying my gaming a lot recently, and this Direct has only fuelled that passion more &#8211; the only problem is going to be finding the time to play all these games! Speaking of which, I&#8217;m off to play some of those said games! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks so much for reading, I really appreciate it.

It&#8217;s been roughly a year and a half since I wrote that post, and the Switch 2 has been out for just over three months &#8211; so we now have comprehensive knowledge of what the system offers. With the Switch 2, Nintendo took the wise (and safe) approach, capitalising on the continued popularity of the Switch brand and not changing things too drastically. The console is more of an iteration rather than a revolution, but it certainly makes significant changes and upgrades in certain areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had some time with the Switch 2, I thought it&#8217;d be a suitable moment to take a look back at my aforementioned post about my hopes for the console, run one-by-one through the list, and talk about which became a reality (and which didn&#8217;t). Then, at the end of the post, I&#8217;ll summarise my current personal opinions on the Switch 2, taking these results into account. Right then, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Optimize the eShop: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My foremost request was to improve the eShop, which was struggling on multiple fronts on the original Switch: the sheer volume of releases made discoverability of games difficult; there was a lack of quality control; and the user interface was susceptible to noticeable lag. In my opinion, this was one of the most important areas for Nintendo to improve upon &#8211; it might seem less flashy than other aspects, but improving the process of finding new digital games is an underrated key aspect of a modern console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To start on a positive note, I&#8217;m pleased with the way Nintendo has improved the responsiveness of the eShop. I immediately noticed how much quicker and easier it is to navigate the store &#8211; gone are the painful moments waiting for the eShop to catch up with your inputs. Whether this is down to the increased hardware power, general eShop optimisation, or both, it improves the experience of browsing through the available games, and encourages curiosity as a result. In my book, that boost to game discoverability is a win for both the player and the developers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, whilst Nintendo has bolstered the options on the eShop main menu, it&#8217;s not as extensively as I&#8217;d hoped. Most of the options &#8211; such as the Search, Current Offers, and Coming Soon &#8211; are the same, and the only brand new addition is the For You tab, which recommends games based on your own gameplay trends. I was really hoping for some other additions, or even a review system so that players could help to recommend games for others. As it is, the eShop still has the problem of a constant inundation of new games &#8211; and whilst the Popular New Releases sub-section is a step in the right direction, any game that doesn&#8217;t qualify for this (or the Highlights tab) will get very limited time to grab player attention before the spotlight is taken by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14942" height="645" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14940" height="639" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14938" height="624" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14941" height="598" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of quality control, I reserve full judgement until more time has passed, but it seems that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t changed their approach. Lots of cheap-looking games are still flooding the eShop, and there are still Hentai games appearing relatively frequently. From my perspective, Nintendo could still do with raising the bar of entry, in order to curate a higher level of overall quality across the eShop. The current influx of these low-quality games worsens the issue of discoverability for other titles, which get mired amidst them despite taking much more time and effort to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the steps I&#8217;d still like to see taken for more eShop filtering options and better quality control, Nintendo has still significantly improved the eShop, especially in terms of responsiveness. Therefore, I mark this section as a success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More Power: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is that age-old request for new consoles &#8211; that they have more power, and are able to present games in higher framerates and resolutions. Since the Wii/DS era, Nintendo has rarely (if ever) been known as the technical powerhouse, with art direction, creative hardware, and recognizable IP being more important for bringing in players. That said, the Switch 2 is a big step up from the original Switch, with Nvidia claiming that it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nvidia-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">&#8220;10 times the graphical performance&#8221;</a> of the previous console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a technical expert, so I look for comparisons to other consoles to get a handle on where the Switch 2 lands power-wise. The general perception seems to be that at peak performance, docked on a TV, the Switch 2 is comparable to a PlayStation 4 Pro, but still behind the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles &#8211; which essentially matches my prediction back in March 2024. When played in handheld mode, the system is closer to a base PlayStation 4, but that is compensated for by the smaller screen, which often makes games look crisper to the eye (at least for me).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a hybrid system with a handheld option, battery life is another crucial factor to consider, and the increased performance does appear to have hurt the Switch 2 in this area. You generally get around two-three hours when playing any sort of intensive game, which can feel quite short. However, most of the time I don&#8217;t see this being an issue, unless I am on a very long journey &#8211; and it&#8217;s rare not to have a nearby place to plug in and charge. Whilst that isn&#8217;t an excuse, I prefer Nintendo providing stronger hardware and a shorter battery life rather than the opposite, so I&#8217;m still satisfied on this front. For example, I&#8217;m playing <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/09/17/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-14-09-23/">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em> at the moment, and occasionally having to charge the console is a small price to pay for how well it plays and looks in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14949" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14946" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14947" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14948" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When playing in handheld mode, the screen really is stunning; the increased size and power makes games look incredible, and it makes playing in bed (or wherever you prefer) feel like a luxury. The vibrancy and sharpness of the screen &#8211; especially when held close up for handheld gaming &#8211; gave me that new-generation-upgrade feeling that I was looking for. I&#8217;ve heard some disappointment that Nintendo didn&#8217;t use an OLED screen, but in my opinion the LCD screen is more than sufficient, and if it helps keep costs down then that&#8217;s a reasonable trade. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll get an OLED version of the Switch 2 (like for the original Switch) at some point too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only Switch 2-exclusive game I&#8217;ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em> (you can <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/10/mario-kart-world-review-a-stunning-racer-that-misses-a-few-tricks/">read my review here</a>), and as well as being a fantastic game, it doubles as an excellent technical showcase for the Switch 2. Played in 4K HDR on my TV, it looks sensational. The game moves with a crisp fluidity, and the environment feels palpably full of detail and colour. It was upon playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> that it really dawned on me that the Switch 2 was a major &#8211; and timely &#8211; graphical update on its predecessor, allowing it to keep fair pace with the technical state of gaming.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14934" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>All that graphical performance is needed to do justice to the beauty of Cow</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>All in all, whilst my test case for the Switch 2 is relatively limited for now (I haven&#8217;t played upgraded Switch games like <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em> yet either), I&#8217;m confident that the Switch 2 has delivered on the level of power I personally need in a Nintendo console. I don&#8217;t need it to be top-of-the-range; as long as the system is powerful enough to realise the trademark visual flair of first-party Nintendo games, and is able to house a strong line-up of new third-party releases, then that&#8217;s plenty for me. I eagerly await seeing what Nintendo can magic up with their bespoke Switch 2 games in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Clarity on Games: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads nicely into my next point, on the topic of the Switch 2 software line-up now and into the future. A console is defined by the games on it &#8211; and there were two particular games I was waiting for news on when I wrote that original post in March 2024. These were <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> and also the next Nintendo EAD game, which I predicted would be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game in the vein of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. We have received news on both of these games, even if the latter wasn&#8217;t quite the game I expected, as it has instead materialised as <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14932" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I am loving the vibrant purples in this art, by the way</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about <em>Metroid</em>. The development path of the long-awaited <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> has been turbulent, to say the least &#8211; after being announced back in 2017, Nintendo then publicly announced that they were restarting development in 2019, with Retro Studios (the developers of the original <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em>) coming back on board. When I wrote my post about my hopes for the Switch 2, we were still awaiting news on Metroid &#8211; but roughly three months later <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/06/19/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-18-06-2024/">in the June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, Nintendo finally showed us an announcement trailer for the newly-titled <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That initial trailer gave us a taste of the returning first-person <em>Metroid</em> gameplay and a glimpse of returning enemy Sylux, which kept fans occupied until February 2025, when it was announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM&amp;t=1631s">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> that <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> would be a cross-generation title on both Switch and Switch 2. Whilst unsurprising, this was welcome news &#8211; and roughly a month later in March, we got another Nintendo Direct trailer (see below), showing off more of the game and giving us a 2025 release date. This was followed up by an extensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9xes7BZto">Nintendo Treehouse video</a> in April, continuing the steady stream of new information on the game. However, as we enter September, we&#8217;re awaiting news on a precise release date, and I hope we hear more soon. Even if the game has to be pushed into 2026, I wouldn&#8217;t mind &#8211; after so long waiting, I&#8217;d prefer to wait a little longer if it means a better experience. What&#8217;s another few months after eight years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be fascinating to see the comparison between the Switch 2 and Switch editions of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>; the enhanced Switch 2 edition will have Joy-Con 2 mouse controls as well as support for 4K, HDR, and 120 fps! After seeing how brilliant <em>Mario Kart World</em> looks, I&#8217;m excited to experience a new <em>Metroid</em> adventure in these formats &#8211; I have a feeling the game will look sensational. So far, it appears that the game isn&#8217;t straying too far from the gameplay of previous <em>Prime </em>games, and instead refining the first-person formula, with some added tricks such as Psychic Abilities for Samus. I&#8217;m especially intrigued to see where the story goes, and am avoiding too many plot details until release!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, I thought <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was the more outlandish of the two games I was anticipating back in March 2024, as I was confident that a new 3D <em>Mario </em>from Nintendo EAD would be announced. I was both right and wrong &#8211; whilst we haven&#8217;t received a 3D <em>Mario </em>per se, we have gotten a new <em>Mario</em>-adjacent Nintendo EAD 3D game, in the form of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! This was the closing reveal in the Switch 2 Direct back in April; but it wasn&#8217;t until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Direct</a> in June that it was announced this isn&#8217;t just a Donkey Kong game, but a Pauline game as well, with a younger version of the character joining DK on his travels!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo EAD have an amazing track record, and the glowing critical reception to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>has been a continuation of this, praising the sheer gameplay creativity and enjoyment. One of the key features is the ability for Donkey Kong to smash through the environment, reshaping and even creating tunnels through it! The game released on 17th July, and I haven&#8217;t actually played it yet, as I haven&#8217;t found the time to justify spending the money on it. But now <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/">that I&#8217;ve finished the Pokémon League in <em>Pokémon Diamond</em></a> and am taking a break from that, I&#8217;ll hopefully soon get around to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, my next definite Switch 2 purchase will be <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, and I&#8217;m very tempted to get <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> too! There&#8217;s also the question about how series such as <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/10/25/where-can-zelda-go-after-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> might manifest on Switch 2, but I&#8217;m happy having patience &#8211; there are already so many other amazing games to play in the meantime!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More System Customization: No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, here we come to the first of my hopes that didn&#8217;t become a reality. The original Switch only allowed very simple customisation of the Home screen, and Switch 2 hasn&#8217;t evolved this at all, still only allowing two Themes: Basic White and Basic Black (my console is set to the latter). Having a Themes menu suggests the idea of having more options, but I&#8217;m not full of confidence, as we haven&#8217;t received any extra options since the original Switch launch in 2017.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14926" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I like neutral colours, but the option to add more flair could be fun</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not a software developer, it feels like Nintendo is missing an open goal by not allowing us to have Themes based on franchises such as <em>Mario</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, or <em>Metroid</em> &#8211; I honestly think people would even spend a small amount on these, in order to add vibrant new visuals to their systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that Nintendo could still add options in the future, but it&#8217;s disappointing that for now there&#8217;s no word on this. In my March 2024 post, I suggested extra options such as the <em>Nintendo Badge Arcade</em> sticker system on 3DS, but now I feel as if I need to keep expectations in check. At this point, even a couple extra Themes would be great to see.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14928" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Themes menu even seems designed to hold more options</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As on the original Switch, the main way of showing personality is through your profile icon. Nintendo has added extra customisation options over time, particularly via the Nintendo Switch Online menu, where you can unlock new characters, backgrounds, and frames for your profile icon. Whilst it&#8217;s a mostly unchanged process from the Switch, I&#8217;m glad this bit of customisation is still present. I imagine it won&#8217;t be too long until we get more Joy-Con 2 colours, so at least there should soon be that avenue for customising the look of your console (if you have the expendable income). Considering how popular the Switch 2 is, it&#8217;d be wonderful to see more done on the digital side to allow players to show their personality. I hope we see developments in this area in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Enhanced Social Features: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth and final entry on this list regards the social aspects of the Switch &#8211; in my original post, this was primarily about having improved voice chat functions, and thankfully, this is the main social aspect where the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade! After years (and multiple console generations) of players asking, Nintendo has finally added an in-built party voice chat to the Switch 2, named GameChat. It&#8217;s now possible to talk to your registered friends over the internet, using the in-built microphone in the Switch (and Camera, if purchased), even if they are playing different software. Whilst it isn&#8217;t revolutionary &#8211; after all, other consoles have had similar systems for a long time &#8211; it&#8217;s a welcome addition that I&#8217;m very happy to see Nintendo include for the Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous Nintendo consoles have had forms of voice chat, but they always had some sort of catch &#8211; for example on the Switch, where voice chat was tied to the Switch Online mobile app. So, it&#8217;s great to see Nintendo introduce a more complete and in-built offering &#8211; if anything, I feel a bit bad, because I doubt I&#8217;ll use it much. As the years have passed, I&#8217;ve gotten used to using Discord as an alternative form of online chat when playing Nintendo games, because it&#8217;s been more convenient &#8211; and I think it&#8217;ll be hard to break out of that routine. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m very glad GameChat has been added for the Switch 2, and I commend Nintendo for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I hoped to see some sort of extensive social hub added, along the lines of Miiverse or StreetPass. The closest is the Nintendo Switch App, which has new functionality such as uploading screenshots, receiving GameChat notifications, and (most intriguingly) interacting with games such as <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (see the images below). But I miss the in-built communal aspects of previous systems, as they brought people together without as much push towards a mobile app. We still have the News channels to get specific updates on the topics and games you choose to follow, but these are mostly one-way interactions. Nintendo has done well in previous generations at creating unique spaces for players to help shape the multiplayer culture of their consoles, but Switch and Switch 2 feel a bit more controlled in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14922" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14921" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14923" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another aspect that the Switch 2 still lacks is an equivalent to Achievements or Trophies. This is something I used to think was a glaring omission, as it would be a great extra motivation to 100% games such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/04/30/lets-chat-a-long-overdue-super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>. But <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/16/why-ive-stopped-caring-so-much-about-achievements-trophies/">as years have gone by</a>, I have gained respect for Nintendo not having this sort of system, whether it be by conscious decision or simply a lack of intention to do so. There&#8217;s something freeing about playing games on the Switch, and indeed, the Switch 2 &#8211; there&#8217;s a lack of TV/streaming apps, or completion-style Achievement/Trophy systems, and instead the focus is all on the act of playing games. That laser-focus is really refreshing, and I&#8217;m not clamouring for those additions at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, whilst I&#8217;d like to see an expansion into a more communal gaming hub in the future, the Switch 2 definitely delivered on my hope for enhanced social features. The addition of GameChat is one of the major upgrades for the Switch 2, and a lot of marketing and development focus went into it, which shows Nintendo listened to player requests for this type of addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After going through those five points, how has the Switch 2 fared when it comes to my personal hopes for the console? Four of my five points were met to some degree of success, which I mark as a win overall. Evidently, Nintendo recognised the general areas where improvements could be made &#8211; and whilst not all of them were as emphatic an upgrade as I may have hoped, the cumulative progress makes for a significant leap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarise, I&#8217;m going to rattle back through the main points. Firstly, the eShop is much easier and faster to navigate, but could still do with more options for filters and user reviews. In addition, the console is a step up in power, and whilst it isn&#8217;t at the level of modern Microsoft and Sony consoles, games look brilliant and the hardware keeps Nintendo in the ballpark for third-party games. Speaking of which, we have received welcome news on <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, and seen the release of a new exciting Nintendo EAD game in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, and now we wait for the likes of <em>Pokémon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and other franchises to launch on the console. Sadly, Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added much in the way of system customization, but it has delivered new social options in the form of GameChat, finally bringing in-built party chat to a Nintendo console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the admitted caveats to some of the &#8220;Yes&#8221; points, I want to focus on the positives of the Switch 2. This is because, despite the iterative nature of the console, it does achieve that new-console feel. I was worried that it might feel like another specification of Switch instead of a brand new thing, but there are enough upgrades to ensure that isn&#8217;t the case. Much of this is down to the optimized power of the console, and how much snappier and responsive it is to play. But another contributing factor is the hardware itself &#8211; in handheld mode, the larger form factor and sleeker Joy-Con 2 designs feels fresh and streamlined, and the console has made playing in bed (for example) feel like a delightful high-end experience. I will say, it helps that I have massive hands, so the larger console size is more comfortable for me personally.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14952" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d like to see Nintendo continue to make software improvements to the Switch 2 &#8211; for example new eShop features, new menu Themes, and extra social hubs &#8211; but I&#8217;m left with a firmly positive impression of the console overall. I&#8217;ve been getting back into playing games more frequently recently, and I&#8217;m glad to say that the Switch 2 has been a contributing factor to that; and if I&#8217;m playing more games and having a good time doing so, that marks the Switch 2 as a success in my book!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this post!

As mentioned in that post, I was part-way through my first ever play through of <em>Diamond </em>at the time of writing. Of the two initial games (<em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>), <em>Pearl </em>was the one I got back in 2007, before then playing the third game <em>Platinum </em>when it released in 2009. I’ve kept my <em>Pearl </em>save to this day, whilst <em>Platinum </em>became the game I’d restart whenever I went back to play through Sinnoh &#8211; especially as it has extra content and various quality-of-life refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I hadn’t ever played <em>Diamond </em>until I felt compelled to buy myself a copy for £48.49 from GAME back in 2019. After all, <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>are second only to <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/07/11/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> in terms of my favourite games ever, so it’s lovely to have the complete set of three physical games. I’ve been gradually playing through <em>Diamond </em>ever since; in that aforementioned 2023 post, I noted that I’d reached the trek to Snowpoint City, roughly two-thirds of the way through the game. Since then, I&#8217;ve played a little bit more each year, finishing the villainous Team Galactic part of the main story, catching the cover Legendary Pokemon Dialga, and now preparing to tackle the Pokémon League!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-12 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14830" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14828" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14829" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14806" height="715" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve played through the Sinnoh-based <em>Pokémon</em> games, and the adventure feels a little different every time, for multiple reasons: , it might be the <em>Pokémon</em> team I choose, the approach I take, or how I’m feeling in my personal life at the time. With this being my first time playing <em>Diamond</em>, it&#8217;s felt unique once again &#8211; and as I gradually get ready to reach the end of the game (and start the postgame), I thought it’d be a nice point at which to write a journal-style post about the playthrough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, this journal approach matches my new writing method I’ve been testing, where I write a little bit every day, even if it’s just a paragraph or two. It’s helped me start posting at a more regular cadence recently, which I’ve really enjoyed, and am hoping to continue! I hope you’ll come with me on my retro-inspired ramble about my current adventuring in Sinnoh, and my plan to defeat the Pokémon League with a team that might be described as unconventional&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Shine Bright Like A&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this playthrough of <em>Diamond</em>, I decided not to create my character as “William”. I often style my avatar as myself on my first playthrough of a <em>Pokémon</em> game; but as I&#8217;ve played through Sinnoh many times before, I instead went for the approach I use on repeated playthroughs. In these situations, I like to create a new character persona, in a way that challenges my team selection, mixes up the gameplay, and allows me to add my own imaginary lore. Over the years, this has often led to me constructing a monotype team (usually Steel, my favourite type), but this time I went for a dichotomy theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14797" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14795" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The character I created is called Lucie, and I think of her as treading the line between both fiery and subdued personalities. Her starter is Chimchar, which will evolve into Infernape, one of the infamously few Fire type Pokémon in the core region of Sinnoh in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em> (the Elite Four member Flint has just two Fire types in their Fire-type team)! Two of the team slots are filled by a pair of Gastrodons (named Gianna and Gillian), a Pokémon which has two forms in Sinnoh: the pink West Sea Gastrodon, and the blue East Sea Gastrodon. By having one of each, it plays into that duality theming; I think of the pink Gastrodon as part of the &#8220;bright&#8221;, flamboyant side of the team, whilst the blue Gastrodon represents the &#8220;nocturnal&#8221;, subtler side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining the West Sea Gastrodon side of the team, we have the blazing Infernape (named Symphony), as well as Raichu (Ryland) and their electrifying moves. These Pokémon both deliver fast, strong damage: for example, Close Combat and Flare Blitz for Infernape, and Thunderbolt for Raichu. On the East Sea Gastrodon side is Noctowl (Miles), which has helpful status moves such as the sleep-inducing Hypnosis, as well as Skuntank (Skylah), which has Toxic for poisoning opponents and whittling them down. As you can probably tell, I&#8217;ve always liked to daydream up my own head canon for the characters and adventure. It helps every playthrough to feel unique, as if I&#8217;m adding extra world-building along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-14 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14793" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14791" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14787" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14788" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14790" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14789" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the team described above certainly isn&#8217;t the strongest possible for <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>&#8211; and I&#8217;m aware I&#8217;m making my life more difficult when it comes to battling the toughest trainers, such as the upcoming Elite Four and Champion Cynthia. But some of these Pokémon (especially Gastrodon, Nowtowl, and Skuntank) are Pokémon I&#8217;ve barely played with before, so I get to experience the challenge of Sinnoh in a brand new way! Mixing up the team helps every playthrough to feel fresh, and strengthens my personal connection with the team &#8211; not just now, but also when I look back on them years later, such as in a longevity app like <em>Pokémon HOME</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">A Girl&#8217;s Best Friend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;ve just finished working through Victory Road, reached the entrance to the Pokémon League, and completed the final fight against your in-game rival (on a whim, I named them Mervin). Relative to other games in the series, I&#8217;d argue that Sinnoh has the best Pokémon League &#8211; the members all have distinct personalities, and present a well-balanced challenge. The difficulty isn&#8217;t unfair, but requires you to take the League seriously; I&#8217;m currently in the phase of backtracking, training up the levels of my Pokémon, and refining the movesets, items, and strategies I&#8217;m going to approach the League with. With the team I&#8217;ve selected, it requires being very deliberate with my choices &#8211; of course, the main advantage I have is that I&#8217;m particularly familiar with the challenge that lies ahead, and can plan accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-15 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14817" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14811" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14821" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14820" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14818" height="168" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216" width="216" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14799" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sinnoh Pokémon League starts with the Bug-type trainer Aaron, who should be the easiest to defeat &#8211; Bug-types have many type weaknesses, such as to Fire and Flying, which my Infernape and Noctowl can target respectively. Next up will be Bertha and her Ground-type team, which will be a tougher test &#8211; the plethora of Ground attacks will be dangerous for Infernape and Raichu, so my two Gastrodons will be relied upon to use their Water-type moves. Noctowl has a useful immunity to Ground, and Skuntank can help out with Toxic, so my team has a decent amount of options for this battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is Flint, who as mentioned earlier, is a Fire-type trainer that curiously has three non-Fire types on their team. The two that are there &#8211; Rapidash and Infernape &#8211; should again struggle against the two Gastrodons, and then the rest of my team should be able to wear down Steelix, Drifblim, and Lopunny without too much issue. Then we&#8217;ll come to Lucian, the final member of the Elite Four, who has a Psychic-type team &#8211; and this is where Skuntank will have their turn taking centre stage, as their Dark typing makes them immune to Psychic moves. With the use of Night Slash (which has an elevated critical hit rate, boosted further by the equipped Razor Claw), Skuntank should carve through a lot of the opponents, with the help of Infernape to tackle the Steel typing of Bronzong.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-16 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14808" height="542" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721" width="721" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14810" height="548" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727" width="727" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing this plan out, it makes me fairly confident at defeating the Elite Four without too much trouble. However, players of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>know that the toughest challenge lies with Champion Cynthia and her excellent team of strong and varied Pokémon (which even includes a Gastrodon of her own)! The biggest threat is her ace Pokémon &#8211; Garchomp &#8211; which can likely take out most of my team with one hit from an Earthquake. My best options are going to be my two Gastrodons, which have strong defensive stats, and can use Blizzard and Ice Beam to hit the double Ice weakness of Garchomp. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll rely on Noctowl and Hypnosis, to give myself some more time. It&#8217;s going to be a nervy battle, but there are routes to success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">In Reflection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage of the game, where I&#8217;m backtracking and gradually training up my Pokémon, showcases some of why I adore <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>so much. In theory, this part could be tiresome, gradually grinding through the experience points needed to make my team stronger &#8211; but instead, I find it tranquil. There&#8217;s something magical about the way music, visuals, and gameplay combine in these games specifically, and I enjoy taking my time; one of the main places I&#8217;m training is Victory Road, as I can access a variety of strong wild Pokémon there. Near the entrance is a useful Pokémon Center for healing your team, and I often pause to listen to the &#8220;Pokémon League&#8221; music that plays outside it. This particular track has both &#8220;Day&#8221; and &#8220;Night&#8221; versions, and the latter is especially beautiful (you can listen below). It&#8217;s a beautifully delicate composition, and captures the feeling of being near the end of an amazing adventure, but with so much still left to enjoy, and no need to rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to this music is just one example of the catharsis I feel when playing <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, which is something I talked about back in my 2023 post. This sentiment comes from a place of both subjectivity and objectivity, as my emotional connection to these games is incredibly strong. After my older sister passed away in 2007, I spent hundreds of hours exploring Sinnoh, and I&#8217;m forever grateful to the soothing effect they had &#8211; and still have &#8211; on me. There are many positive aspects I associate with this: the meticulous sprite artwork and colour palette; the endearing Pokémon and character designs; the region full of secrets to explore; the sprawling Underground; and that amazing soundtrack, just to name a handful of reasons why I love these games so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I prepare to enter the Pokémon League, I&#8217;ve also started thinking about the postgame, which in <em>Diamond </em>includes a whole separate island northeast of Sinnoh, named the Battle Zone (see the map below). It includes the Fight Area, Resort Area, and Survival Area, plus Stark Mountain. The Fight Area includes the Battle Tower in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>, which is less extensive than the expanded Battle Frontier in <em>Platinum</em>, but still offers plenty of challenge and longevity. I love the sheer amount of space left to discover in the postgame; this island is like an extra enclosed region to explore. Currently, I&#8217;m undecided on whether I&#8217;ll dive straight into this after the Pokémon League, or take a break and come back at a later time.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14813" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I&#8217;m well acquainted with the celebratory feel of the Battle Zone island, and may well get drawn into playing it immediately! After the high of defeating the Pokémon League, it&#8217;s wonderful to realise there&#8217;s still so much left for your Pokémon and you to explore. The Battle Zone has a vacation vibe, especially as you initially take a ship to get there &#8211; and the music is also uplifting and energetic, for example Route 225, which feels like a burst of energy, complete with the iconic clapping (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQvx9STW1V0">go to 00:42 in this video</a>)! Overall, the Battle Zone has a celebratory feel, and adds a lot to the overall package of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. I&#8217;m excited for the character of Lucie to extend her adventure, and take her dual-themed team onwards and upwards!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Space and Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope with this post is that it shone a light on two things: the reasons that set this playthrough of <em>Diamond </em>apart, and more detail on why I have such a strong connection to <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. They are such special games to me personally, and for a long time, I&#8217;ve considered how to do that connection justice on this site. The 2023 post was a very cathartic one for me to write, and this post is an extension of that. It&#8217;s amazing how our personal circumstances can affect our thoughts on games (and other forms of media) &#8211; and I love hearing about these stories from other people too, as it often sparks positive discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14850" height="514" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827" width="827" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that down the line, I get to write another post about <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, talking about how the character of Lucie faced the Pokémon League, and then ventured into the postgame and Battle Zone. Down the line, I&#8217;ll likely inevitably play <em>Pokémon Platinum</em> again, and that&#8217;ll continue to be the game I go back to for replaying Sinnoh. For now though, I&#8217;m glad to have completed my physical set of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>games, and to be nearing the final stages of <em>Diamond</em>, with plenty of gameplay hours still ahead to look forward to!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for reading, I sincerely appreciate it. I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a brilliant day!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-featured-2.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-featured-2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827', 'medium': 'image'}]}

This is the first brand new <em>Mario Kart</em> on consoles since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> on Wii U back in 2014 (the Switch received an upgraded version, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, in 2017, which I skipped) &#8211; so at least for me personally, it&#8217;s felt a long time coming. Mixed in with the excitement of a brand new Nintendo console, it made the launch of <em>Mario Kart World</em> feel like a real event, especially when played with friends, which is where <em>Mario Kart</em> always excels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, in various different configurations: both on the TV and in handheld, in solo, local co-op, and online with a friend. Now, I&#8217;ve reached a point where I feel I can state a comprehensive opinion on the game, having experienced both the racing modes and the open world that&#8217;s a major selling point of this iteration of <em>Mario Kart</em>. My thoughts are overall very positive, but there are also some flawed aspects to the game  &#8211; but I&#8217;ll expand upon this more later on in the review. Without further ado then, let&#8217;s get into it!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Start Your Engines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it was the new-console glow, or perhaps it was that wait since <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, but launching into <em>Mario Kart World</em> for the first time felt distinctly special. The game encourages you straight into exploring the open world first; this consists of the various tracks connected by open spaces of road, field, water, desert, and more. What&#8217;s immediately remarkable about the game is just how gorgeous it looks, both in handheld but also especially when played on a 4K HDR TV &#8211; and whilst this isn&#8217;t new technology, it&#8217;s wonderful to play Nintendo games in such high fidelity via the Switch 2. The visual direction of <em>Mario Kart World</em> makes brilliant use of the new hardware, presenting a world full of vibrancy, colour, and personality &#8211; which is shown in the track designs, whether it&#8217;s the bustling Shy Guy Bazaar, the scrumptious Sky-High Sundae, or the fiery Bowser&#8217;s Castle, just to name three!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-17 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14727" height="574" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mkw_sgb_view.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14724" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14725" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_17.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The infused personality is evident in the roster of characters (complete with various different unlockable outfits). Returning are your usual suspects like Mario, Luigi, Peach, and so forth; additionally, there are plenty of newcomers, including minor enemies such as Konkdor and Cataquack, and even bit-part characters such as Dolphin and, of course, Cow! If you&#8217;ve seen any discourse about <em>Mario Kart World</em> since the initial announcement, you&#8217;ll know that the Cow and their adorable grin has captured the attention of the internet, and I&#8217;ve had a wonderful time watching the various memes and edits their inclusion has spawned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the characters have a range of changeable outfits too, which are unlocked by collecting Dash Food bags from vendors in races or the open world. It adds an extra way to differentiate the characters, ranging from punk rock biker looks to desert outfits and much more in between &#8211; and they can be combined with the plentiful different karts and bikes to create the aesthetic you&#8217;re looking for. A Photo Mode has been added in tandem with this, giving plentiful options for taking pictures that show off the world and characters as you see fit. Me being me, I&#8217;m sad that we got an Explorer outfit Toad but no actual Captain Toad&#8230; But there&#8217;s always time for that in DLC, hopefully!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14754" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A smorgasbord of Yoshi! Or Yoshis? Yoshies?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The attention to detail in both audio and graphic effects is especially apparent when you build up speed. Karts and bikes camber side-to-side when they hop and drift; tyres are spongey and visibly bounce and recoil according to the track surface; and sparks crackle off your vehicle as you drift and build up a boost, just to name a small handful of the details I&#8217;m talking about. I particularly like the tension of drifting around the sharpest corners, with the screen often tilting with you and making it extra satisfying to hit the apex. Plus, the music is noticeably exceptional, supplying a consistently energetic chorus that accentuates the gameplay &#8211; especially in the final unlockable tracks, which supply a climactic crescendo unlike any other I&#8217;ve experienced in <em>Mario Kart</em>. Overall, the whole experience is lifted by this pristine look and feel, whether it&#8217;s the relatively laid-back open world, or the competitive modes, where the palpable sense of momentum is most gripping. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a Knockout!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the &#8220;World&#8221; being a key selling point of the game, it&#8217;s still those core competitive modes that retained the tightest grip on my attention. Whilst the expected familiar selection of Grand Prix, custom VS, Battle, and Time Trial modes are all here, the game deserves credit for also introducing a brand new main mode to go alongside Grand Prix. This goes by the name of Knockout Tour, where 6 different tracks are combined together into one extra-long race. It takes advantage of the increased count of 24 racers to introduce checkpoint gates along the way, eliminating those at the back each time. Essentially, it&#8217;s a way of introducing popular battle royale-esque sensibilities into <em>Mario Kart</em>, and it creates a very fun sense of chaos &#8211; especially in local multiplayer, when your friends and you are desperately trying to stay in the race amidst the various items flying around!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14736" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A road trip across the Mushroom Kingdom! Thankfully, less traffic jams than real life</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Knockout Tours are arguably the biggest challenge awaiting completionist solo players in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It&#8217;s classic knowledge now that to get the maximum 3-star rating in Grand Prix, you need to win all four races; but in Knockout Tour, you need to be leading through every single checkpoint! This is an extremely tough task, as it necessitates not just victory, but to be consistently leading &#8211; even despite homing Red Shells, or the dreaded blue Spiny Shells that target the leader. I set myself the personal challenge of 3-starring every Knockout Tour, and it led to many failed attempts, but it was highly satisfying when I finally achieved that goal. For <em>Mario Kart</em> veterans, it&#8217;s a good addition to have a target that takes this extra level of dedication to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just mentioned the items and the chaos synonymous with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and that side of the game is just as entertaining (and frustrating) as ever before! To me, <em>Mario Kart</em> is similar to other games such as <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> because at their core, each iteration is built on the same gameplay loop, and it makes it tough to critique a new entry &#8211; on one hand, it&#8217;d be unwise to stray too far from what makes the series so immensely popular, but on the other, there has to be enough new ideas to justify a new game that still feels imaginative.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-18 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14737" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14738" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14740" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As aforementioned, the Knockout Tours are a standout way in which <em>Mario Kart World</em> achieves the latter, and some of these ideas bleed over into Grand Prix, where you don&#8217;t just drive around four tracks &#8211; instead, after the first race, the initial laps are rolling starts, as you drive across the world to the next track, road-trip style. It&#8217;s a neat way to keep the same formula but match it to the open-world aesthetic of <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and in VS there are options to play either in this mode, or with the traditional laps, catering to either preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further to this, there are tweaks to the racing itself, the most notable arguably being the new parkour/trick abilities. If you drive up onto a rail, you can grind along it and perform extra trick boosts, and you can even trick onto a wall and wall-ride along it, which opens up jaw-dropping shortcuts if you master this ability (there are plenty of astonishing clips doing the rounds online)! On top of this, drifting boosts can now be used in a straight line, and launch you off the ground slightly to help initiate some of these parkour moves. In combination, all these extra options elevate the height of the skill ceiling, and keep <em>Mario Kart World</em> engaging for those who have mastered previous entries in the series. Crucially, it does this without losing the accessibility as a go-to local multiplayer party game &#8211; the extra skills are a cherry on top for those who want to go above and beyond, but they&#8217;re not essential for winning races against the CPU.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14755" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Boo Cinema is another standout track, which applies a film filter to part of the course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Items are one of the infamous levellers of <em>Mario Kart</em>, and there have been some tweaks and additions on this front too. Your usual roster of shells, bananas, and mushrooms, and more are all here, although it&#8217;s noticeable that the raw power of items such as Bullet Bill have been slightly softened, perhaps to accommodate the new racer count of 24. Some of the notable new items include the golden Coin Shell, which leaves a trail of coins behind it, and the feather, which leaps you into the air, opening another opportunity to perform tricks, wallrides, and other shortcuts. To more literally aid more inexperienced players, there are still the helpful options for motion controls, auto-accelerate, and driving aids. Whilst these aren&#8217;t new, they&#8217;re still great to see return, and are often essential for balanced 4-player sessions that everyone can enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Give Me a Boost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As fun as <em>Mario Kart</em> can be in solo play, multiplayer is where the series has always shined brightest, and that continues to be the case for <em>World</em>. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to play with several combinations of friends, and the game has impressively accommodated their varying levels of <em>Mario Kart</em> experience each time, whether they&#8217;re a fresh newcomer or someone who&#8217;s been away from the series for a while. It&#8217;s easy to criticize the items when they&#8217;re hitting you, but they do a great job at helping those towards the back stay with the pack, and there&#8217;s still the option to use items such as shells and bananas defensively whilst in the lead.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14743" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Expect to shout at your friends &#8211; in a pleasant way, of course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Local multiplayer has consistently resulted in a brilliant time, complete with the playful shouting, cheers, and competitive back-and-forth that you hope for from <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; so I can report that it&#8217;s a success in that department! My favourite local multiplayer option is the extended custom VS modes, which have plenty of customisable options, including speed, difficulty, item frequency, and the amount of races, which go up to 32 at a time. As a big Formula 1 fan, I love to nerd out about the accumulated points and the drama of how the final standings will end up, so VS will inevitably become my most-played mode!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of online play, <em>Mario Kart World</em> doesn&#8217;t quite hit the same heights as local multiplayer, because of that lack of immediate in-person reaction &#8211; and whilst it&#8217;s admirable that Nintendo has added chat functionality, I did end up defaulting to using a Discord call instead, because of the familiarity and ease of use. The main motivation to play online is to raise your versus rating (VR), which is essentially the same system we had way back on <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>. In my opinion, it&#8217;s disappointing that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added more reasons to play online, especially in a gaming landscape where online games consistently add new modes, tournaments, and other rewards for playing consistently. The end result is that I quickly fell off of online multiplayer, and have focused mostly on solo and local multiplayer.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14753" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Driving on water supplies opportunity to perform tricks as you bounce over the waves</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, I found that the returning Battle Mode was most ideal for multiplayer &#8211; in <em>World</em>, there are two options, Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, which will be familiar to players of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. Balloon Battle gives you five balloons to protect whilst doing your best to hit opponents and earn points for removing their balloons, and Coin Runners has you searching for as many coins as you can, whilst again attempting to hit others and remove their coins (whilst avoiding them doing the same to you). I have to say, I&#8217;ve never been a huge Battle Mode fan over the years, and this version hasn&#8217;t changed that &#8211; but conversely, if you love Battle Mode, this will fill that quota well. My main disappointment is that the modes are time-based instead of score-based, as I generally prefer having that concrete target and the tension of seeing who can reach it first. Despite my criticisms, I am glad Battle Mode is back, as it offers a welcome change of pace from the racing modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Free as a Birdo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, a major differentiator for <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the inclusion of a free roam mode, where you can explore the tracks (and the spaces between them) at your leisure. There&#8217;s certainly an immediate novelty to this &#8211; I have nostalgic memories of <em>LEGO Racers 2</em>, which I played a lot on PC as a child, and included a similar experience of exploring an open world between races in a colourful, family-friendly world. My hope was that <em>Mario Kart World</em> might recapture that whimsical feeling, and supply a world with plenty of secrets and rewards, and most importantly motivation to find them. At first, <em>World </em>is successful in this; one of my earliest ventures was rocking up to the Dino Dino Jungle area, and visiting the inner laboratory/auditorium section. With precise driving and the careful use of tricks, you can make your way to the top of this area &#8211; which is thrilling the first time, but soon the realisation kicks in that there&#8217;s a lack of reason to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-19 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14746" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14747" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14745" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in free roam,<em> Mario Kart World </em>has an uncanny sense of emptiness, and it&#8217;s partly because that palpable sense of forward energy &#8211; which is so prevalent in the competitive modes &#8211; is gone, without being replaced by much else. It&#8217;s not that there isn&#8217;t anything to do in the open world &#8211; for example, there are Peach Medallions and Question Mark Panels to find, as well as P Switches that activate various challenges &#8211; but the problem is that there isn&#8217;t much motivation to track all these things down. The main rewards are stickers, which are small graphic icons you can attach next to your profile name, and feel inconsequential. More work needed to be done to make the world feel alive, and not just like a suspended state of limbo from the Grand Prix mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toads and Shy Guys milling around and making campfires are a great touch, but they&#8217;re another short-lived novelty that doesn&#8217;t add substance to the experience of navigating the open world. It&#8217;s fun to find items and complete challenges, but they&#8217;re incredibly scattered &#8211; and whilst there&#8217;s a tracker for the Question Mark Panels, there&#8217;s curiously no in-game indicator for how many Medallions or Switches are left to find (and also no statistics or records screen for other modes, either). On the other hand, something free roam does do well is increasing the level of awe the world has. You can travel a long way out into the ocean, and discover sea dragons, whales, and more, and I had a great time inspecting the scale of impressive courses such as DK Spaceport. As mentioned at the start of the review, <em>Mario Kart World</em> is a stunning game to look at and listen to, and the open world gives you more time to do just that.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14748" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>P Switch challenges often consist of time trials</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s a great shame that there&#8217;s no formal splitscreen multiplayer for the open world &#8211; there&#8217;s a partial workaround, by loading into an empty wireless mode lobby, but challenges are turned off, and it&#8217;s not at all optimal. In a game marketed on free roam, and in a series known for local multiplayer, it&#8217;s a disappointing oversight that significantly reduces the reason to play this way. I have occasionally played free roam in single-player as a laid-back secondary experience, for example when listening to a podcast or talking to friends &#8211; but it has untapped potential as a playground for friends to enjoy together, and honestly, I think this would&#8217;ve papered over many of my problems with the emptiness of the open world. Instead, more often than not, you&#8217;ll launch straight into Grand Prix, Knockout Tour, or VS, as that is where the most joyous parts of <em>Mario Kart World</em> reside.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to the end of this review, I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;ve flagged multiple issues I have with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; so I need to re-emphasize that this is a genuinely excellent <em>Mario Kart</em> game, that not only delivers the best-looking and best-sounding entry into the series, but has multiple new ideas and modes that make it feel distinct. Changeable character outfits, new trick mechanics, and especially the Knockout Tour mode supply fresh style that have made <em>World </em>my new go-to local multiplayer game, and a game I&#8217;ve spent many an enjoyable hour in by myself as well. The main disappointment has to be the free roam mode, which feels sparse and quickly struggles to retain player attention &#8211; and I really hope that in the future, Nintendo supports the game with additional content that fills out this world more. Alternatively, add Captain Toad to the playable characters, and I&#8217;ll probably be happy, haha! In all seriousness, <em>Mario Kart World</em> definitely has flaws, but the core racing experience is dazzling, and it&#8217;s a superb way to start the Switch 2 era!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

I&#8217;ve written about this in multiple posts on this site, and I&#8217;ve noticed how I&#8217;m gradually getting deeper into the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> ecosystem: starting with looking back to the anime, and then playing the online game <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and now getting more invested in learning about the current meta and competitive side of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> is a complicated game with lots to learn (and relearn) for someone like me, who hasn&#8217;t been up-to-date on the meta since I stopped playing local tournaments about a decade-and-a-half-ago. But I&#8217;m slowly learning, and I&#8217;m enjoying how it&#8217;s happening naturally, via watching various YouTube creators, playing different decks in <em>Master Duel</em>, and even constructing a real-life deck that I could conceivably return to local tournaments with. So, in this post, I&#8217;m going to talk a little more about these various aspects of the game, the deck I&#8217;m playing, and why I&#8217;m enjoying this process so much!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Getting the Fire (Kings) Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve already written about <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/12/31/why-im-giving-yu-gi-oh-master-duel-another-shot/">how I&#8217;ve gotten back into <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em></a>, but only now have I reached the point where I&#8217;m starting to understand the competitive meta. At first, I was playing relatively low-powered (by current standards) decks such as Dark Magician and Monarchs, because those cards were familiar to me. But realistically, those decks aren&#8217;t fast-paced enough to keep up nowadays, so I started testing other avenues. I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of Gravekeepers, which can sometimes work in the competitive scene, if you draw the right cards (such as Necrovalley) in order to shut off abilities from the opponent. But this wasn&#8217;t a strategy that was going to help me learn the competitive game long-term, and I found that I eventually reached a point of repetition and subsequent burnout playing the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-20 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14664" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14665" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14666" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gravekeepers brought me a decent level of success!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This brought me to the HERO cards, especially Destiny HEROs, as I have a nostalgic affinity for them. The modern HERO cards have many combo effects that special summon various powerful cards, so they were much more helpful for learning the increased modern speed of combos in a deck. But I still found the HERO cards to lack flexibility for different situations, and I again reached a point where I hit a brick wall with the deck. It felt like I had hit also hit a wall in my efforts to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> in a contemporary fashion, as I couldn&#8217;t find a deck I clicked with. So I took a bit of a break from <em>Master Duel</em>, and started looking into which decks would be viable to assemble if I was playing the physical TCG (Trading Card Game). After looking at various Structure Decks as starting points, I finally found one which made sense to test out: Fire Kings!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire Kings are a deck based around monsters that destroy themselves either on the field, in the hand, or from the deck, to then activate various effects, including summoning monsters and destroying cards on the field. In addition, they have an impressive boss monster in &#8220;Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings&#8221;, which can destroy every other monster on the field (and has a magnificent summoning animation in <em>Master Duel</em>, see below)! The fiery aesthetic of these cards is well-realised in the stunning artwork, which mixes regal distinction with blazing power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-21 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14678" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14674" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14676" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14677" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14675" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Master Duel summon animations are, in a word, awesome</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the cards are relatively accessible in the real world, with only &#8220;Fire King Courtier Ulcanix&#8221; demanding a higher price point (of about £15 a copy). Most of the main Fire King cards can be acquired in the modestly priced Fire King Structure Deck &#8211; I bought three copies of this, as well as some other products (such as the recent Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Deck, which includes reprints of staple cards such as Infinite Impermanence), to construct a real-life Fire King deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, I find it helpful to have a real deck in front of me, which I can draw test hands with to slowly understand the playstyle better (I&#8217;m hoping for a reprint of Ulcanix, so I don&#8217;t have to drop £45-ish on a playset)! The result of this process is finally finding an archetype I like, which is viable to build in both <em>Master Duel</em> and the TCG &#8211; and to top it all off, Fire Kings are competitively strong too! Whilst they aren&#8217;t currently considered a top tier deck like Maliss or Ryzeal, Fire Kings do perform well in current competitive play, even winning the YCS Birmingham event this year, piloted by Dinh-Kha Bui! This tells me that if I can improve my own skill and understanding of the deck, then Fire King can reach a high ceiling of play in both <em>Master Duel</em> and local tournaments (should I decide to go&#8230; More on that later)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14669" height="696" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>It needs some changes still, but my TCG Fire King deck is taking shape!</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m playing lots of Fire King in Ranked games on <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and with every game, every new scenario, and every mistake I make (I&#8217;m admittedly still making a lot of those), I&#8217;m learning the intricacies of the deck, how to perform the best combos, and how to make the strongest boards in combination with my Extra Deck of Link, XYZ, and Synchro Monsters. I like how Fire Kings have such a strong Fire connection, which enables them to make use of several non-Fire cards as additions to the deck. For example, a common choice for Fire Kings is &#8220;Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames&#8221;, which can revive back one of your Fire Kings alongside it when summoned. This synergy is very satisfying, and ties into the overall theme of the deck, resulting in an archetype that feels richly-designed and well-realised. I&#8217;m enjoying learning the Fire King strategies, and I hope that by my next <em>Master Duel</em> post on this site, I can report that I&#8217;ve become steadily better at piloting the deck!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Creators I Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside my own proactive efforts to become better at contemporary <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I&#8217;ve been watching several YouTube creators that are a brilliant source of both entertainment and knowledge for me. <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/">In previous posts, I&#8217;ve mentioned</a> how TGS Anime and Team APS helped me get reacquainted with classic <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, which lines up with my aforementioned play of anime decks such as Dark Magician. I still watch these channels, but I&#8217;ve added several others to my regular watchlist, including the &#8220;wonky quartet&#8221; of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGuDrveqBgD0S9nqaOPw6Q">Farfa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MBTYuGiOh">MBT</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Nyhmnim">Nyhmnim</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dzeeff">Dzeeff</a>, who consistently create great content focused primarily around <em>Master Duel</em>. Often, they add fun variables to challenge themselves, such as in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xajsij7iS98">Master Chef</a> series by MBT, or the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbldWY88--A">Storage Wars</a> series by Farfa.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Videos like this (by Joshua Schmidt) are brilliant at showcasing both the fun and skill of </em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly thanks to these channels and their collaborations, I&#8217;ve also become aware of other popular YouTubers &#8211; specifically, ones focused around high-level competitive play. These are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaSchmidtYGO">Joshua Schmidt</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jessekottonygo">Jesse Kotton</a>, who are well-known for often winning or placing highly in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> tournaments. Both of them balance speaking confidently about modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> with also making videos that are fun to watch, which is very impressive and makes them stand out. Both their channels have been helpful to me, and I also like it when they have those earlier-mentioned collaborations with channels like Farfa and MBT, as they bring a little bit of extra seriousness to those videos. Discovering this range of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> players and creators has been an unexpected extra positive side effect of getting back into the game and franchise!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">It&#8217;s Time to Duel?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;ve talked about how I&#8217;ve not just been looking at the digital version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> (with <em>Master Duel</em>), but also my physical collection of cards as well. I have a fairly large amount of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> cards, mostly from my childhood and teenage years, and further supplemented with occasional more recent purchases when something has stood out to me. Those Fire King and Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Decks have given me access to plenty of modern cards to assemble a deck with, and I also picked up products like the Duel Devastator set from 2019, which was full of guaranteed competitive staples like &#8220;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&#8221;. This is all to say that I&#8217;m nearing a place where not only am I improving at <em>Master Duel</em>, but I could conceivably go to an in-person event near me and test out my skills in person (scary, I know, haha)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14673" height="672" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Recent structure decks have been ideal for helping me build Fire Kings</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Jokes aside, there&#8217;s only a few things stopping me from doing this, and one of them is overcoming that social anxiety. I&#8217;ve become better at this over the years, but I definitely find the initial ice-breaking of heading to a new club/group quite daunting. About a year ago, I also experienced this when joining a nearby running club &#8211; there is that initial awkward stage of getting to know people and faces, but it gets easier over time. I&#8217;m confident that this wouldn&#8217;t be a long-term issue, especially as I now know a friend who has introduced me to a local store that hosts Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next barrier is more closely related to the theme of this post &#8211; and that&#8217;s a personal target to be relatively well-acquainted with the game before showing up to a local tournament again. I&#8217;m definitely nearing this stage, and part of this preparation would be making the finishing touches to my Fire King deck. I&#8217;d like to get that playset of three Fire King Courtier Ulcanix first, as they&#8217;re integral to the strength of the deck. The card is out of stock on most sites, and my best route currently seems to be waiting for a good UK price on Cardmarket. I could wait and hope for a cheaper reprint, but there is no sign of this happening at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jesse Kotton has a video about Fire Kings and their affordability</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I&#8217;d like to get a copy of some extra staple Extra Deck cards such as &#8220;S:P Little Knight&#8221;, and possibly acquire some extra non-Fire King cards that often seen play in the deck, such as &#8220;Bystial Magnamhut&#8221; and &#8220;Bystial Druisworm&#8221;. The main thing I&#8217;m keeping an eye on is price &#8211; for example, in an ideal world I&#8217;d also add competitively strong cards such as &#8220;Mulcharmy Fuwalos&#8221; to the deck, but that would cost another £70-ish for a playset, and I haven&#8217;t even gone to a local event yet (I do have a tendency for overthinking)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve still not decided if I&#8217;ll make the time to make the leap to playing the TCG in-person again, but I&#8217;m getting increasingly tempted to have a go. It would enable me to test out my skills, and it could also be a way to make new friends and connections. When I went to local events in my teenage years, I enjoyed the trading side of the game too &#8211; and who knows, perhaps that&#8217;s a better way to acquire some of these missing cards for my Fire King deck. If I do decide to go, I hope to write up about my experience on this site, however well (or badly, haha) it goes!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the third <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> centric post I&#8217;ve written over the last 8 months, and they&#8217;re good reflections of how I&#8217;ve gotten back into the franchise as a whole: not just my nostalgic connection, but how I&#8217;ve been learning about the modern game and how it&#8217;s evolved over time. I admittedly used to be someone who lamented that <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> had become too complicated and suffered from power creep &#8211; and whilst those aren&#8217;t completely untrue, I think they were oversimplifications on my part. Having now taken the time to ingrain myself back into the world of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I see that the game has developed into something new &#8211; something faster, more complex, and in some ways arguably better than before.</p>\n\n\n\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top: 75%;">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this post has explained how I&#8217;m pushing myself to get better at the game, with the conduit of a Fire King deck as my resource for playing the game at a higher skill level than before. I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn still, both about this deck and other decks, but I&#8217;m having an excellent time doing so &#8211; which is probably evidenced by me considering playing the TCG in-person again at some point in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this post, and I sincerely hope you are happy, healthy, and having a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/03/how-fire-kings-are-helping-me-learn-competitive-play-in-yu-gi-oh-master-duel/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Right then, let&#8217;s get into the post, and I hope you enjoy the read!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Edinburgh Marathon 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/">my build-up and training for the Edinburgh Marathon</a> multiple times since I started planning in November 2024, and after a train journey up to Edinburgh and a couple of days in the city, on May 25th 2025 the day finally arrived for my first marathon! My parents and some close friends were there to support me, and I also had the support of all those who contributed to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">my charity fundraiser for Beat</a> (the Eating Disorder charity). Thank you to everyone who donated or even just took a look at my Justgiving page &#8211; I&#8217;m really proud to spread awareness for a charity that means a lot to both my family and I.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14636" height="607" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So, you may be asking, how did the marathon go? It was a tough one, and Scotland threw all the elements at us. There were periods of sun, rain, strong winds, and even hail when I reached approximately mile 20! As expected, the last 10-ish miles are where the battle really begins, as much mental as physical. It was important to me that I do my absolute best and never stop or walk if I can help it, and at mile 25 I got to see my friends and family cheer me on as I neared the finish line!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was an unexpectedly dramatic finish. With the finish line in sight, and as I pushed for the line with maybe 100 metres left to go, I was struck with the notorious &#8220;jelly legs&#8221; and fell. I managed to get back to my feet with the help of another nearby runner, and made it to the line. As someone who is very critical of themselves, I was disappointed at not finishing the run in better style &#8211; and this is where my family and friends were invaluable at stopping me from being too harsh on myself. It was a great reminder of how much they care for me and how much support I had on the day, and I am incredibly grateful to them and everyone else who has congratulated me since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-22 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14624" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Early on&#8230; !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14622" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the race</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14623" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final stretch!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Including Gift Aid, we raised £1,821.77 for Beat, and I&#8217;m very proud of this, as well as the personal achievement of finishing the marathon. I&#8217;m still deciding whether or not to do another marathon &#8211; after not finishing in quite the way I hoped, I am feeling motivated to do another one, maybe the Norfolk Marathon in 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest gaming news stories over the last few months has been the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. As not only a gaming fan but also specifically a Nintendo fan, I got my console immediately, and have been playing it a significant amount since! Whilst it&#8217;s more of an iteration than a revolution in terms of hardware, I personally enjoy the larger console and screen size, as it fits my larger hands very well. The only exclusive game I have so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I&#8217;ve put many an hour into!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14620" height="534" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, <em>Mario Kart World</em> feels like the first new entry since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> many years ago, as I played a lot of the latter on Wii U and never felt the need to buy the <em>Deluxe</em> version on Switch. Therefore, <em>World</em> feels very fresh to me, and it&#8217;s also visually spectacular (especially on a big 4K HDR TV). I&#8217;ve 3-starred all the Grand Prix and am now working away at the Knockout Tours, which are battle-royale style checkpoint races new to this game. These Knockout Tours are very tough to get 3-stars on, but I&#8217;m enjoying the challenge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a few criticisms of the game &#8211; including my own biased disappointment at no inclusion of Captain Toad, haha &#8211; but also about the open-world twist on the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula. In concept, it&#8217;s a smart way to go, but I have mixed feelings on the execution, as the world feels a little empty and repetitive to explore. Despite this, I&#8217;m going to save my full thoughts, as I plan to write a dedicated review at some point soon. One thing is for sure, and that&#8217;s <em>Mario Kart World</em> being the new go-to local multiplayer game for my friends and I!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the Switch 2 itself, it does feel like an investment for the future, as outside of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and now <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> (which I hope to play soon), there&#8217;s a lack of headline exclusive titles. But for now, the hardware upgrade and promise for the future &#8211; plus the fun of <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; has made it feel worth the purchase for this Nintendo fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-text-align-left">My watching habits have been quite eclectic recently! In terms of the films, the standout has to be <em>Superman</em> &#8211; as a huge DC fan, I had high hopes for this fresh, brighter take on the iconic character, and James Gunn and company thoroughly delivered. The film is a shining beacon of positivity, fun, and creativity, and David Corenswet is a brilliant Superman to centre the new DCU around. I&#8217;m very excited to see where things go in the future, but for now I&#8217;m just so happy that we got a satisfyingly hopeful take on Superman again. I&#8217;m hoping that these vibes continue in <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> on the Marvel side, which I&#8217;m going to see tomorrow as of writing this!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-23 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14617" height="1023" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg?w=819" width="819" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14618" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg?w=691" width="691" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of TV, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to <em>The Walking Dead</em> (I really liked the recent film <em>28 Years Later</em>, and I think it&#8217;s helped put me in the zombie mood). I originally stopped watch <em>The Walking Dead</em> in Season 8, which is where a lot of people dropped off, in the war between Rick and Negan. However, I heard that it picks up afterwards, so I decided to go back, charge through Season 8, and see what I find in those last few seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst Season 8 remains a poorly-paced season, I&#8217;m glad I went back, especially because Season 9 is brilliant TV. Clearly lessons were learned from the negative reception to previous seasons, and Season 9 focuses back on character development, inventive new threats, and grounded emotional stakes. It hooked me in and I&#8217;m enjoying the ride of these last few seasons!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m already looking ahead to watching the newer <em>The Walking Dead</em> spin-offs such as <em>The Ones Who Live</em> and <em>Daryl Dixon</em>, to see where these characters end up. Other than <em>The Walking Dead</em>, I&#8217;m also slowly making my way through the latest Marvel show <em>Ironheart</em>, which hasn&#8217;t been marketed very well by Disney &#8211; which is a shame, as it&#8217;s very well-made and full of great performances.  To loop back around to <em>Superman</em> and the DCU, I&#8217;m also eagerly anticipating <em>Peacemaker</em> Season 2, which will tie into that film and the larger world!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this summation of some of what I&#8217;ve been up to recently! One of my goals for the rest of the year is to start writing here more consistently &#8211; I&#8217;ve been saying this for a while, but it&#8217;s something I really want to get back to. It&#8217;s been necessary for me to spend more time on my personal life and take breaks from writing, but in the process of that personal growth, it&#8217;s reminded me how much I like writing about the things I play, watch, and do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I often get distracted or hit writer&#8217;s block, so I&#8217;m considering the approach of setting aside a little bit of time every day to write with no background music/videos, as opposed to my previous strategy of writing in big time chunks all at once. Either way, I&#8217;m planning to be more present on here in the second half of the year, and I look forward to it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sincerely hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a wonderful day!

Many hours of my weekends have been devoted to building up my distance; I am a longtime runner, but had never ran more than a half-marathon before my marathon training this year. Last weekend I did my longest run, a 23.2-miler (my poor legs), and I&#8217;m now tapering down before the big day. My mental health has been low recently, and the marathon has been a good target for my mind to try and focus on, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14584" height="560" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025"><em>https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m both excited and nervous for the event, for which I will be journeying to Edinburgh a few days beforehand. I&#8217;m also doing the run to fundraise for <a href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/">Beat, the Eating Disorder charity</a> &#8211; this is a cause close to my heart, as my amazing sister Charlotte passed away in 2007 after battling anorexia. As aforementioned in my previous post, you can view my Justgiving page <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">at this link</a>, and any donations would be very much appreciated, but there&#8217;s no pressure at all to donate!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Upcoming Book Projects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a designer for Titan Books, I get to work on some really exciting projects, and honestly that fulfilment in my work means a lot to me &#8211; it&#8217;s very rewarding to have a physical product of your work, especially when it&#8217;s related to a property (such as Marvel or <em>Star Trek</em>) that you enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get to experience working on several exciting film retrospectives, and some upcoming ones from Titan include books on <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>,<em> </em>The Crow films, and <em>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</em>, which you can see covers for below!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-24 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14562" height="904" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706" width="706" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14564" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800" width="800" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14563" height="927" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of fiction, the final Mike Hammer novel <em>Baby, It&#8217;s Murder</em> released recently, and there are upcoming Marvel paperbacks for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Annihilation</em> and <em>Doctor Strange: Dimension Wa</em>r.

I&#8217;m very impressed by what was shown, and have my pre-order in for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. Whilst I like physical media, I can&#8217;t justify that high £74.99 price point for buying <em>Mario Kart</em> separately. Those game prices are the main criticism so far &#8211; the only other hesitation is seeing Nintendo choose surety over innovation in terms of hardware. I&#8217;m confident the Switch 2 will be a huge hit, but I do slightly miss those eclectic reveals of the Wii U, 3DS, Wii, DS, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what I&#8217;m playing, I&#8217;ve been struggling with burnout and game-playing-motivation recently, so haven&#8217;t played much. I have however briefly gotten back into<em> Bravely Default</em> on the DS (which ironically has a Switch 2 version coming soon), and continue to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel </em>now and then. I&#8217;m hoping my game-playing motivation returns soon, but am also not putting too much pressure on myself, as I don&#8217;t want to force it. I look forward to the Switch 2 hopefully reigniting that fire a bit &#8211; oh, and please add Captain Toad to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, Nintendo! It would make me very happy indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve admittedly struggled to get back into games recently &#8211; but when it comes to TV, I&#8217;ve been keeping more up-to-date, and there&#8217;s a lot that I&#8217;ve been liking recently! The second season of <em>Andor </em>and second (or fifteenth, depending on how you count) season of <em>Doctor Who</em> are currently airing, and both are fantastic. <em>Andor </em>continues the engrossing drama and brilliantly tangible visual design of the first season, and this era of <em>Doctor Who</em> is really hitting a stride, with unexpected surprises amidst the brilliantly imaginative stories. I really hope the rumours of <em>Doctor Who</em> taking a break after this season are false, as Ncuti Gatwa is sensational, portraying a charismatic and emotionally healed Doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also just finished watching through <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Netflix-verse of Marvel TV (especially<em> Jessica Jones</em>), so to see some of those characters returning has been wonderful. The series feels like both a reinvention and a continuation of the original three <em>Daredevil </em>seasons, and I&#8217;ve been thrilled by how well it has turned out. The character work, cinematography, and courtroom/political intrigue is all here, and I am stoked for Season 2 &#8211; I just hope some of the Defenders do turn up in Season 2, including not just Jessica Jones, but Luke Cage and Iron Fist too!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a quick rundown on what I&#8217;ve been doing, playing, and watching!

There are so many brilliant expansions out there, but I wanted to match the original post by Dryad and limit myself to six entries. So, any omissions are not necessarily a negative reflection on that game &#8211; more likely, it just didn&#8217;t make the cut for this post, especially as I want to take this chance to include expansions that don&#8217;t always get the limelight they deserve. It&#8217;s been hard cutting it down to six choices!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summation, this list isn&#8217;t a definitive ranking, but instead a personalised list of six brilliant game expansions that I&#8217;d like to give some attention to, and explain why I have a personal connection with. Also, please go and read the original article that inspired me over at Game Praisers, which you can do <a href="https://gamepraisers.wordpress.com/2024/12/18/the-best-expansions/">by clicking here</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right then &#8211; onto my list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/29/horizon-zero-dawn-review/">greatly enjoyed <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a>, it didn&#8217;t take much convincing for me to download the expansion <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>! With such an expansive and imaginative open world, it&#8217;s a double-edged sword when it comes to DLC; on one hand, you know people like this world, but on the other, you really have to make the expansion stand out from that world to set it apart. For <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, this is done with a new area named The Cut, full of cold weather, dangerous new machines such as the Scorcher, and intriguing story reveals that bridge the gap between <em>Zero Dawn</em> and the sequel <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/03/30/horizon-forbidden-west-review/">Forbidden West</a></em> (incidentally, the only reason I haven&#8217;t included the <em>Forbidden West</em> DLC on this list is because I don&#8217;t have a PS5 to play it on)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cut is full of activities for main character Aloy, whether it be exploration, narrative, or combat &#8211; including optional super-hard combat trials for the real masochists among us. The local tribe (named the Banuk) tie into the aforementioned overarching story, and as Aloy discovers literal machinations under the snow-covered surface of The Cut, it increased my anticipation around where the sequel will go next &#8211; which is surely a sign of a successful DLC. When I wrote <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/02/14/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds-review/">my review for <em>The Frozen Wilds</em></a> back in 2018, I also noted how it made small steps to improve dialogue animations (which were sometimes quite static in the main game), and you can see how that was continued to full fruition in the dynamic conversations of <em>Forbidden West</em>. Not only is <em>The Frozen Wilds</em> substantial and utterly beautiful to look at, but it actively improves the gameplay foundation of a series I adore.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Mass Effect 3: Leviathan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious choices when it comes to <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC are the fantastic <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> for <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, or the <em>Citadel </em>DLC that served as an epilogue for <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. However, the expansion I have the strongest personal connection to is <em>Leviathan</em>, the first of the <em>Mass Effect 3</em> DLCs. I only bought an Xbox 360 shortly before <em>Mass Effect 3</em> launched, and that game was my gateway into the series (I went back and played the entire trilogy afterwards). After mainly playing on Nintendo consoles beforehand, the concept of single-player expansions was relatively foreign to me &#8211; but after being so enraptured by <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, I was incredibly excited at the prospect of more story content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ending of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is infamous for being disappointing to many people &#8211; but in a way, it made me more excited for DLC that would further flesh out the backstory of the giant world-destroying Reapers that you face throughout the trilogy. <em>Leviathan </em>is all about the discovery of a secret race named (you guessed it) Leviathans, who predate even the mysterious Reapers. In the DLC, you journey across space to piece together morsels of information about their origins. I particularly like the planet 2181 Despoina, a planet covered in water and full of secrets and intense combat situations. That sense of discovering places that were meant to be hidden forever is thrilling, especially when you get to the climactic moments that reveal how the Leviathans play into the wider battle against the Reapers &#8211; and it&#8217;s that rush of energy that makes <em>Leviathan </em>stand out as my favourite <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker &#8211; Special Episode</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very happy when <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> got a Switch release, as it allowed even more people to play this gem of a game &#8211; and I was even happier when in early 2019, a new selection of levels was added with the <em>Special Episode</em> expansion! Whilst this isn&#8217;t a large single-player story expansion like some of the other games I&#8217;ve included in this list, I wanted to highlight this DLC for <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, as it&#8217;s a joyful addition with plenty of value for money (currently £5.39 on Switch). Also, yes, I&#8217;m biased for Captain Toad, but that&#8217;s besides the point, aha&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who haven&#8217;t played <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, it&#8217;s a delightful puzzle game that sees Captain Toad and Toadette make their way through levels based on Hakoniwa Japanese box gardens, with the player rotating and shifting the levels around in order to progress. The <em>Special Episode</em> adds 5 brand new levels and 13 challenges that reinvent previous courses, so 18 new levels to play through in total. As with the main game, there&#8217;s a lovely variety, from haunted caves full of Boos, to a treacherous ship, to another minecart ride! As <em>Treasure Tracker</em> is presented in several book chapters, the DLC additions fit in smoothly, and I&#8217;d frankly happily play as many levels as Nintendo is happy to add (I really hope we get a sequel one day)! The <em>Special Episode</em> is a wonderful and endearing addition to <em>Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Dragon Age: Inquisition &#8211; Trespasser</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a brilliant time with all of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> DLCs, but it&#8217;s the final DLC <em>Trespasser </em>that&#8217;s my favourite of the bunch. Requiring story completion to play, it&#8217;s a definitive end &#8211; and cliffhanger &#8211; to <em>Inquisition</em>, even preventing you from returning to the main game afterwards. The plot brings the player to a summit assembled to decide what happens to the Inquisition now that the main threat has been ended, but soon a new conspiracy is discovered. This eventually reveals that Solas (an eleven mage who&#8217;s a consistent presence in the <em>Dragon Age</em> series) is secretly Fen&#8217;Harel and the Dread Wolf. He&#8217;s been responsible for many of the magical occurrences that have played a part in the game, and he&#8217;s now seeking to collapse the Veil that separates worlds, despite the catastrophic consequences it&#8217;d cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For players who&#8217;ve spent many hours around this character who they thought was on their side, it&#8217;s a dramatic reveal that created a lot of excitement for the sequel to <em>Inquisition</em>. Solas even cuts off the arm of the main character to prevent them stopping him, before disappearing and leaving the player with the decision of whether the Inquisition should be continued or disbanded. <em>Trespasser </em>does have competent combat elements too, but the story is the focus here, and it&#8217;s always been memorable thanks to the anticipation it created for the sequel. However, despite <em>Trespasser </em>releasing in 2015, we only got <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/08/04/dragon-age-the-veilguard-why-im-optimistic-what-id-like-to-see-next/">The Veilguard</a></em> at the end of 2024, so it did leave a lot of time for players to stew and theorize!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Resident Evil 5: Lost in Nightmares/Desperate Escape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I first played <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/02/resident-evil-5-review/">Resident Evil 5</a></em> in 2020, and I did so on PS4, where both the DLC expansions <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> and <em>Desperate Escape</em> are bundled in with the main game, so I&#8217;m going to include them both together for the purposes of this list. Whilst <em>Resident Evil 5</em> certainly has flaws, it also has a lot to praise, such as how it leans into cinematic storytelling. The two DLCs act as a prequel and an in-between-quel, and give an opportunity to play as series mainstay (and <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/23/my-5-favourite-video-game-characters/">my favourite <em>Resident Evil</em> character</a>) Jill Valentine, as well as the pilot Josh Stone. Firstly, <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> is set before <em>Resident Evil 5</em>, and shows Jill and Chris Redfield infiltrating the Spencer estate to confront Albert Wesker. We see snippets of this encounter &#8211; which leaves Jill presumed dead &#8211; during the main game as flashbacks, but here we get to play through it all: puzzles, combat, and Wesker boss fight included. Jill and Chris are the quintessential <em>Resident Evil</em> partners, so it&#8217;s comforting to see them interact (well, as comforting as it can be when facing down monstrosities).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Desperate Escape</em> is set towards the end of the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> campaign, just after Sheva Alomar and Chris manage to free Jill from the mind control of Wesker. Whilst the former pair go after Wesker in the main game, we never got to see how Jill and Josh made their own way out, and we get to play that out for ourselves here. This is arguably the tougher DLC of the two, less puzzle-focused and more about, well, desperately escaping &#8211; ending with a horde-assault sequence that gets frenetic on the higher difficulties. Both DLCs are great for different reasons, and as a combo add a lot to the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> story experience. Jill getting her time to shine is great too, especially as she wasn&#8217;t playable in the main game. This is timeline-wise the last time we got to play as Jill in the main story, too &#8211; please take the hint, Capcom&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The Last of Us: Left Behind</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You knew this had to be on here, right? In my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> rose the bar for story expansions, just like <em>The Last of Us</em> rose the bar for narrative video games. <em>Left Behind</em> fits into the later portions of <em>The Last of Us</em>, after Joel is near-fatally injured, and Ellie is hunting for medical supplies in an abandoned mall. This forms part of Left Behind, but it&#8217;s also interspersed with flashbacks to three weeks before the main game, where Ellie is taken by her friend Riley to break into another abandoned mall in Boston &#8211; and this is where the DLC shines at its brightest. As with many of the other expansions in my list, the core gameplay is a solid continuation of the main game, but it&#8217;s the story advancements and believable character interactions which leave the strongest impact here, giving us brand new information on Elie and her backstory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the best parts of the DLC aren&#8217;t fighting infected, but instead when Riley and Ellie are exploring the desolate mall. They find carousels, video games, and plenty more to play with and talk about. The in-gameplay dialogue that <em>The Last of Us</em> uses so well is continued here, resulting in a moment between the two girls that is both natural and surprising, especially for blockbuster games at the time. It&#8217;s all interwoven with that bittersweet sense that something bad is going to happen &#8211; after all, this is an apocalyptic world, we didn&#8217;t hear much about Riley in the main game, and we know Ellie gets bitten at some point. Those moments do come, but they maintain all their dramatic impact because of the masterful way Naughty Dog combines gameplay and narrative (and also because of brilliant performances by Yaani King as Riley and Ashley Johnson as Ellie). As I said at the start &#8211; in my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> raised the bar for story expansions, and it&#8217;s still one of my favourites to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>With that, we come to the end of the list! As mentioned earlier, there are plenty other great DLC expansions out there, but these are six of my own favourites, each for their own specific reasons. Thanks again to Dryad at Game Praisers for the inspiration for this post!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this also got you thinking about your own favourite gaming expansions &#8211; I&#8217;d love to hear about your picks, so please feel free to let me know in the comments!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have an amazing week!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/03/09/6-of-my-favourite-video-game-expansions/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/expansions.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/expansions.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

What else could I do but fall further into the card-based rabbit hole?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In combination with watching content creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TGSAnime/featured">TGS Anime</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TeamAPS">Team APS</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MBTYuGiOh">MBT</a>, and generally enjoying catching up on the state of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I&#8217;ve continued to enjoy my time with <em>Master Duel</em> &#8211; and the 3rd Anniversary has offered plenty more reason to stick around. Therefore, I thought I&#8217;d give a quick overview of what&#8217;s been added to the game and why I&#8217;ve found it so rewarding!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Look to the Skies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s immediately obvious which archetype Konami is pushing with this event &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the Sky Strikers, who were introduced back in 2018 and have become incredibly popular since. The first two <em>Master Duel </em>anniversaries tied into Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so it&#8217;s admittedly a shame we don&#8217;t have a Red-Eyes Black Dragon event to round out the central three <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> Duel Monsters characters of Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey &#8211; but I suppose the power of the fan-favourite Sky Striker characters Raye and Roze was just too strong!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14502" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14515" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14519" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png" width="2560" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop is filled with new items featuring board backgrounds, player mates, card backs, a deck box, and more focused around the Sky Strikers, plus admittedly stunning alternate arts for the main Sky Striker cards. I&#8217;m not an expert on the archetype, but all the amazing artwork and shiny bonuses definitely has me intrigued to learn more about the characters!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of&#8230; The new solo Story is unsurprisingly focused around the Sky Strikers. However, what makes this even more special is the addition of animated sequences within the Sky Striker story, which have been taken from the upcoming anime <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME: THE CHRONICLES</em>. For those who don&#8217;t know, Konami recently announced that this anime will be starting in April 2025, and will be focused on the actual card lore itself. So, instead of revolving around duels (like <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em>, <em>5D&#8217;s</em>, or <em>Arc-V</em> did, for example), <em>CHRONICLES </em>will be set within the world of the cards, which is very exciting! It&#8217;s been announced that these episodes will include the archetypes Fall of Albaz, Dogmatika Ecclesia, and yes &#8211; Sky Strikers!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14505" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14507" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14508" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing small clips of the anime in the <em>Master Duel</em> solo mode was unexpected, and acts as a lovely tease of what&#8217;s to come. The animation is vibrant and expressive, and it&#8217;s great to see this willingness to expand on the card lore &#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely be checking these anime episodes out as they release. Also I have to mention that the new UI for the solo mode is much improved and more player-friendly, segmenting the various solo stories up in a cleaner way, which I appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Festival Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next major addition to <em>Master Duel</em> is the two Festivals that are happening this month &#8211; the first one, Legend Anthology, features a custom banlist that excludes common staples, such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. In theory, this shakes up the meta within the mode, especially with three pre-made decks ready for players to use. However, this mode is dominated by the new Exodia deck and cards, in particular The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate, which can reach upwards of 10000 ATK and can also negates card effects. Often, the match is decided on the coin flip, as if a player goes first and gets out this Exodia card, it&#8217;s extremely hard to the opponent to stage a comeback. Still, the mode has plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, so it&#8217;s worth grinding through.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14511" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14510" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14509" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m much more excited for the upcoming Fusion X Synchro Festival (starting 17th February), which will restrict the Extra Deck to only Synchro/Fusion monsters, and cut out all the options that Link and XYZ monsters have added. I&#8217;m growing to respect those newer card types more over time, but it&#8217;ll still be fun to play some games that make players revert to pre-XYZ strategies. Hopefully it&#8217;ll allow some of my older classic decks to be a bit more viable (at least briefly)! Just like the Legend Anthology, there are plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, which should make it worth the playtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Plenty of Prizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that has always pleasantly surprised me about <em>Master Duel</em> is how generous it is as a Free-to-Play game. The 3rd Anniversary is timed with the start of a new Duel Pass, which is a 700-Gem purchase that &#8211; if you complete it &#8211; earns you all your Gems back, as well as cosmetic and in-game currency rewards, such as a background themed around the aforementioned Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate. If I had to suggest improvements, it would be for a few more unique cosmetic rewards in the Pass &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to complain too much about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the Sky Striker items I mentioned earlier, the shop also has a new Structure Deck full of the expensive HERO cards, new Selection Packs that include those new Exodia cards, as well as another chance to buy previous Anniversary-exclusive items themed around Blue-Eyes White Dragon. As someone who took a long break from <em>Master Duel</em>, I appreciate this a lot, and am slowly working my way through acquiring these.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14517" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14512" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14514" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The deck that&#8217;s currently giving me the most success is my anti-meta Gravekeeper deck, which I&#8217;ve fine-tuned to include more drawing cards and be more reliable (see the decklist image above). I&#8217;ve also finally put together my Destiny HERO deck, which is more meta, and features more Extra Deck combo cards. For long-term success in <em>Master Duel</em>, I need to learn more of these combo plays (and how to combat other combo decks), so I don&#8217;t want to stick with anti-meta decks like Gravekeepers for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my quick summation of the new <em>Master Duel</em> features and how they&#8217;ve positively affected the game &#8211; I&#8217;m really enjoying the amount to do right now, as well as the continued support Konami is bringing. I&#8217;m still slowly re-acclimatising myself to <em>Master Duel</em> after such a long time away, but I&#8217;m continuing to enjoy it and play a few duels every day. If anyone else is intrigued in giving the game a shot, I&#8217;d say now is an ideal time to jump on board, as the game is offering many player-friendly rewards that not only play on nostalgia for <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, but also relate to future projects like the <em>CHRONICLES </em>anime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this quick article &#8211; and if you&#8217;re playing <em>Master Duel</em>, let me know how you&#8217;re finding it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Here’s how.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">The Nadia story</h2>\n    <p>This is a vision of what success looks like.</p>\n    <p>Nadia lives in LA.\n    She has a popular social-media account with a reputation for stylish pictures of urban\n    life. She’s not terribly political, just a talented street photog. Her handle is “CoolTonesLA@hotpix.example”.</p>\n    <p>She’s in Venice Beach the afternoon of Sunday August 9, 2026, when federal agents take down a vendor selling\n    cheap Asian ladies’ wear. She gets a great shot \n    of an enforcer carrying away an armful of pretty dresses while two more bend the merchant over his countertop.\n    None of the agents in the picture are in uniform, all are masked.</p>\n    <p>She signs into her “CoolTonesLA” account on <code>hotpix.example</code> and drafts a post saying “Feds raid Venice\n    Beach”. When she uploads \n    the picture, there’s a pop-up asking “Sign this\n    image?” Nadia knows what this means, and selects “Yes”. By midnight her post has gone viral.</p>\n    <img alt="Content Credentials glyph" class="inline" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/cr.png" />\n    <p>As a result of Nadia agreeing to “sign” the image, anyone who sees her post, whether in a browser or mobile app,  also\n    sees that little “Cr” badge in the photo’s top right corner. \n    When they mouse over it, a little pop-up says something like:</p>\n    <blockquote class="popup"><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Signature is valid.<br />Media was posted by <span class="fakelink">@CoolTonesLA</span><br />on \n    <span class="fakelink">hotpix.example</span><br />at 5:40 PM PDT, August 9th, 2026.</p></blockquote>\n    <p>The links point to Nadia’s feed and her instance’s home page. Following them can give the reader a feeling\n    for what kind of person she is, the nature of her server, and the quality of her work. Most people are inclined to believe the\n    photo is real.</p> \n    <p>Marco is a troublemaker. He grabs Nadia’s photo and posts it to his social-media account with the caption\n    “Criminal illegals terrorize local business. Lock ’em up!”  He’s not technical and doesn’t strip the metadata. Since the\n    picture is already signed, he doesn’t get the “Sign this picture?” prompt.\n    Anyone who sees his post will see the “Cr” badge and mousing over it makes it pretty clear that it isn’t what he says it\n    is. Commenters gleefully point this out.  By the time Marco takes the post down, his credibility is\n    damaged.</p>\n    <p>Maggie is a more technical troublemaker. She sees Marco’s post and likes it, strips the picture’s metadata, and reposts it. \n    When she gets the “Sign this picture?” prompt, she says “No”, so it doesn’t get\n    a “Cr” badge. Hostile commenters accuse her of posting a fake, saying “LOL badge-free zone”. It is less likely that her\n    post will go viral.</p> \n    <p>Miko isn’t political but thinks the photo would be more dramatic if she Photoshopped it to add a harsh dystopian lighting\n    effect. When she reposts her version, the “Cr” badge won’t be there because the pixels have changed.</p>\n    <p>Morris follows Maggie. He grabs the stripped picture and, when he posts it, says “Yes”\n    to signing. In his post the image will show up with the “Cr” and credit it to him, with a “posted” timestamp later than Nadia’s initial\n    post. Now, the \n    picture’s believability will depend on Morris’s. Does he have a credible track record?\n    Also, there’s a chance that someone will notice what Morris did and point out that he stole Nadia’s picture.</p>\n    <p>(In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if people ran programs against the social-network firehose looking for media signed by more than\n    one account, which would be easy to detect.)</p>\n    <p>That’s the Nadia story.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">How it’s done</h2>\n    <p>The rest of this piece explains in some detail how the Nadia story can be supported by technology that\n    already exists, with a few adjustments. If jargon like “PKIX” and “TLS” and “Nginx” is foreign to you, you’re unlikely to\n    enjoy the following. Before you go, please consider: Do you think making the Nadia story come true\n    would be a good investment?</p>\n    <p>I’m not a really deep expert on all the bits and pieces, so it’s possible that I’ve got something wrong. Therefore, this\n    blog piece will be a living document in that I’ll correct any convincingly-reported errors, with the goal that it\n    accurately describes a realistic technical roadmap to the Nadia story.</p>\n    <p>By this time I’ve posted enough times about C2PA that I’m going to assume people know what it is and how it works. For my long,\n    thorough explainer, see\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/10/28/C2PA-Workflows">On C2PA</a>. Or, check out the\n    <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/">Content Credentials Web site.</a></p>\n    <p>Tl;dr: C2PA is a list of assertions about a media object, stored in its metadata, with a digital signature that includes the\n    assertions and the bits of the picture or video.</p>\n    <p>This discussion assumes the use of C2PA and also an in-progress specification from the\n    <a href="https://cawg.io">Creator Assertions Working Group</a> (CAWG) called\n    <a href="https://cawg.io/identity/1.2-draft">Identity Assertion</a>.</p>\n    <p>Not all the pieces are quite ready to support the Nadia story. But there’s a clear path forward to closing each gap.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">“Sign this picture?”</h2>\n    <p>C2PA and CAWG specify many assertions that you can make about a piece of media. For now let’s focus just on what we\n    need for provenance. \n    When the media is uploaded to a social-network service, there are two facts that the server knows,\n    absolutely and unambiguously: Who uploaded it (because they’ve had to sign in) and when it happened.</p>\n    <p>In the current state of\n    the specification drafts, “Who” is the <code>cawg.social_media</code> property from the draft\n    <a href="https://cawg.io/identity/1.2-draft/#vc-credentialsubject-verifiedidentity-type">Identity Assertion spec, section\n    8.1.2.5.1</a>, and “When” is the <code>c2pa.time-stamp</code> property from the\n    <a href="https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_requirements_2">C2PA\n    specification, section 18.17.3</a>.</p>\n    <p>I think these two are all you need for a big improvement in social network  media provenance,\n    so let’s stick with them.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">What key?</h2>\n    <p>Let’s go back to the Nadia story.\n    It needs the Who/When assertions to be digitally signed in a way that will convince a tech-savvy human or a PKIX validation\n    library that the signature could only have been applied by the server at <code>hotpix.example</code>.</p>\n    <p>The C2PA people have been thinking about this. They are working on a\n    <a href="https://iptc.org/verified-news-publishers-list/">Verified News Publishers List</a>, to be maintained and managed by,\n    uh, that’s not clear to me. The idea is that C2PA software would, when validating a digital signature, require\n    that the PKIX cert is one of those on the Publishers List.</p>\n    <p>This isn’t going to work for a decentralized social network, which has tens of thousands of independent servers\n    run by co-ops, academic departments, municipal governments, or just a gaggle of friends who kick in on Patreon. And anyhow,\n    Fediverse instances don’t claim to be “News Publishers”, verified or not.</p>\n    <p>So what key can <code>hotpix.example</code> sign with?\n    Fortunately, there’s already a keypair and PKIX certificate in place on every social-media server, the one it uses to\n    support TLS connections. The one at <code>tbray.org</code>, that’s being used right now to protect your interaction\n    with this blog, is in <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/</code> and the private key is obviously not generally readable.</p>\n    <p>That cert will contain the public key corresponding to the host’s private key, the cert\'s ancestry, and the host name.\n    It’s all that any PKIX library needs to verify that yes, this could only have been signed by\n    <code>hotpix.example</code>. However, there will be objections.</p>\n    <p><b>Objection</b>: “<code>hotpix.example</code> is not a Verified News Publisher!” True enough, the C2PA validation libraries would\n    have to accept X.509 certs. Maybe they do already? Maybe this requires an extension of the current specs? In any\n    case, the software’s all open-source, could be forked if necessary.</p>\n    <p><b>Objection</b>: “That cert was issued for the purpose of encrypting TLS connections, not for some weird photo provenance\n    application. Look at the\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_identifier">OID</a>!” OK, but seriously, who cares?\n    The math does what the math \n    does, and it works.</p>\n    <p><b>Objection</b>: “I have to be super-careful about protecting my private key and I don’t want to give a copy to the hippies\n    running the social-media server.” I sympathize but, in most cases, social media is all that\n    server’s doing.</p>\n    <p>Having said that, it would be great if there were extensions to Nginx and Apache httpd where you could request\n    that they sign the assertions for you. Neither would be rocket science.</p>\n    <p>OK, so we sign Nadia’s Who/When assertions and her photo’s pixels  with our host’s TLS key, and ship it off into the\n    world. What’s next?</p> \n    <h2 id="p-5">How to validate?</h2>\n    <p>Verifying these assertions, in a Web or mobile app, is going to require a C2PA library to pick apart the assertions and\n    a PKIX library for the signature check.</p>\n    <p>We already have\n    <a href="https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs">c2pa-rs</a>, Rust code with MIT and Apache licenses.\n    Rust libraries can be called\n    from some  other programming languages but in the normal course of affairs I’d expect there soon to be native implementations.\n    Once again, all these technologies are old as dirt, absolutely no rocket science required.</p>\n    <p>How about validating the signatures?  I was initially puzzled about this one because, as a\n    programmer, certs only come into the picture when I do something like <code>http.Get()</code> and the\n    library takes care of all that stuff. So I can’t speak from experience.</p>\n    <p>But I think the infrastructure is there.  Here’s a Curl blogger praising\n    <a href="https://eissing.org/icing/posts/curl-apple-sectrust/">Apple SecTrust</a>. Over on Android, there’s\n    <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/X509ExtendedTrustManager">X509ExtendedTrustManager</a>.\n    I assume Windows has something. And if\n    all else fails, you could just download a trusted-roots file from the\n    <a href="https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html">Curl</a> or\n    <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/ca-certificates/+/master/files/">Android</a> projects and refresh it\n    every week or two.</p> \n    <h2 id="p-7">What am I missing?</h2>\n    <p>This feels a little too easy, something that could be done in months not years. Perhaps I’m oversimplifying.\n    Having said that, I think the most important thing to get right is the scenarios, so we know what effect we want to achieve.</p>\n    <p>What do you think of the Nadia story?</p>'}]}

I would so like to return to\n    arguing about Functional Programming or Free Trade.  This is risky and there’s a pretty good chance that I’m\n    completely wrong. But I’ll try to entertain while prognosticating.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Reverse Centaurs</h2>\n    <p>That’s the title of a\n    <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/commentary-cory-doctorow-reverse-centaurs/">Cory Doctorow</a> essay, which I think is spot\n    on. I’m pretty sure anyone who’s read even this far would enjoy it and it’s not long, and it’d help understand this.\n    Go have a look, I’ll wait.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Hallucinations won’t get fixed</h2>\n    <p>I have one good and one excellent argument to support this prediction. Good first: While my understanding of LLMs is not\n    that deep, it doesn’t have to be to understand that it’s really difficult (as in, we don’t know how) to connect the model’s\n    machinations to our underlying reality, so as to fact-check.</p>\n    <p>The above is my non-expert intuition at work. But then there’s\n    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04664">Why Language Models Hallucinate</a>, three authors from OpenAI and one from Georgia\n    Tech, which seems to show that hallucinations are an inevitable result of current training practices.</p>\n    <p>And here’s the excellent argument: If there were a way to eliminate the hallucinations, <em>somebody already would\n    have</em>. An army of\n    smart, experienced people, backed by effectively infinite funds, have been hunting this white\n    whale for years now without much success. My conclusion is, don’t hold your breath waiting.</p>\n    <p>Maybe there’ll be a surprise breakthrough next Tuesday. Could happen, but I’d be really surprised.</p>\n    <p>(When it comes to LLMs and code, the picture is different; see below.)</p>\n    <h2 id="p-1">The mass layoffs won’t happen</h2>\n    <p>The central goal of GenAI is the elimination of tens of millions of knowledge workers.\n    That’s the only path to the profits that can cover the costs of training and\n    running those models.</p>\n    <p>To support this scenario the AI has to run in Cory’s “reverse centaur” mode, where the models do the work and the\n    humans tend them. This allows the production of several times more work per human, generally of lower quality, with inevitable\n    hallucinations. There are two problems here: First, that at least some of the output is\n    <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity">workslop</a>, whose cleanup costs eat away at\n    the productivity wins.\n    Second, that the lower quality hurts your customers and your business goes\n    downhill.</p>\n    <p>I just don’t see it. Yeah, I know, every CEO is being told that this will work and they’ll be heroes to their\n    shareholders. But the data we have so far keeps refusing to support those productivity claims.</p>\n    <p>OK then, remove the “reverse” and run in centaur mode, where smart humans use AI tools judiciously to improve productivity\n    and quality. Which might be a good idea for some people in some jobs.\n    But in that scenario neither the output boost nor the quality gain get you to where you can dismiss enough\n    millions of knowledge workers to afford the AI bills.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">The financial damage will be huge</h2>\n    <p>Back to Cory, with <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/27/econopocalypse/#subprime-intelligence">The real (economic) AI\n    apocalypse is nigh</a>. It’s good, well worth reading, but at this point pretty well conventional wisdom as seen by everyone who\n    isn’t either peddling a GenAI product or (especially) fundraising to build one.</p>\n    <p>To pile on a bit, I’m seeing things every week like for example this:\n    <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/23/ai-boom-unsustainable-tech-spending-parabolic-deutsche-bank/">The AI boom is\n    unsustainable unless tech spending goes ‘parabolic,’ Deutsche Bank warns: ‘This is highly unlikely’</a>.</p>\n    <p>The aggregate investment is ludicrous. The only people who are actually making money are the ones\n    <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e93e56df-dd9b-40c1-b77a-dba1ca01e473">selling the gold-mining equipment</a> to the peddlers.\n    Like they say,\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Stein#Stein\'s_Law">“If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.”</a> Where\n    by “forever”, in the case of GenAI, I mean “sometime in 2026, probably”.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">… But the economy won’t collapse</h2>\n    <p>Cory forecasts existential disaster, but I’m less worried.\n    Those most hurt when the bubble collapses will be the investing classes who, generally speaking, can afford it. \n    Yeah, if the S&amp;P 500 drops by a third, the screaming will shake the heavens, but I honestly don’t see it hitting as hard as\n    2008 and don’t see how the big-picture economy falls apart. That work that the genAI shills say would be automated away is still\n    gonna have to be done, right?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">The software profession will change, but not <em>that</em> much</h2>\n    <p>Here’s where I get in trouble, because a big chunk of my professional peers, including people I admire, see\n    GenAI-boosted coding as pure poison:\n    <a href="https://anthonymoser.github.io/writing/ai/haterdom/2025/08/26/i-am-an-ai-hater.html">“In a kind of nihilistic symmetry,\n    their dream of the perfect slave machine drains the life of those who use it as well as those who turn the gears.”</a> (The\n    title of that essay is “I Am An AI Hater.”)</p>\n    <p>I’m not a hater.\n    I argued above that LLMs generating human discourse have no way to check their output for consistency with\n    reality. But if it’s code, “reality” is approximated by what will compile and build and pass the tests. The agent-based systems\n    iteratively generate code, reality-check it, and don’t show it to you until it passes. One consequence is that the\n    quality of help you get from the model should depend on the quality of your test framework. Which warms my\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/05/15/Testing-in-2021">testing-fanatic</a> heart.</p>\n    <p>So, my first specific prediction: Generated code will be a routine thing in the toolkit, going forward from here. It’s pretty\n    obvious that LLMs are better at predicting code sequences than human language.</p>\n    <p>In <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer">Revenge of the junior developer</a>, Steve Yegge\n    says, more or less, “Resistance is useless. You will be assimilated.” But he’s wrong; there are going to be places where we\n    put the models to work, and others where we won’t. We don’t know which places those are and aren’t, but I have (weaker)\n    predictions; let’s be honest and just say “guesses”.</p>\n    <p>Where I suspect generated code will likely appear:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>Application logic: “Depreciate the values in the <code>AMOUNT</code> field of the <code>INSTALLED</code> table forward\n      ten years and write the <code>NAME</code> field and the depreciated value into a CSV.” Or “Look at JIRA ticket 248975 and\n      create a fix.”</p>\n      <p>(By the way, this is a high proportion of what actual real-world programmers do every day.)</p></li>\n      <li><p>Glorified StackOverflow-style lookups like I did in\n      <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/01/First-AI-Code">My First GenAI Code</a>.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Drafting code that needs to run against interfaces too big and complex to hold in your head, like for example the\n      Android and AWS APIs (“When I shake the phone, grab the location from GPS and drop it in the <code>INCOMING</code> S3 bucket”). Or\n      CSS (“Render that against a faded indigo background flush right, and hold it steady while scrolling so the text slides around\n      it”).</p></li>\n      <li><p>SQL. This feels like a no-brainer. So much klunky syntax and so many moving pieces.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Where I suspect LLM output won’t help much.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>Interaction design.

Today I represent… nobody, <em>officially</em>. I’m not on any of the committees nor am I an\n    employee of any of the providers. But I’m a photographer and software developer and social-media activist and have written a lot about\n    C2PA. So under all those hats this is a subject I care about.</p>\n    <p>Also, I posted this on Twitter back in 2017.</p>\n    <img alt="Twitter post from 2017 presaging C2pA" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/2017-twitter.png" />\n    <p>I’m not claiming that I was the first with this idea, but I’ve been thinking about the issues for quite a while.</p>\n    <p>Enough self-introduction. Today I’m going to look at C2PA in practice right now in 2025. Then I’m going to talk about what I\n    think it’s for. Let’s start with a picture.</p>\n    <img alt="Picture of a shopping mall storefront" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/L1000004.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>This smaller version doesn’t have C2PA,<br />but if you click on it, the larger version you get does.\n    <br />Photo credit: Rob Pike</p></div>\n    <p>I should start by saying that a few of the things that I’m going to show you are, umm, broken. But I’m still a C2PA fan. Bear\n    in mind that at this point everything is beta or preview or whatever, at best v1.0. I think we’re in glass-half-full mode.</p>\n    <p>This photo is entirely created and processed by off-the-shelf commercial products and has content credentials, and let me say\n    that I had a freaking hard time finding such a photo. There are very few Content Credentials out there on the Internet. That’s\n    because nearly every online photo is delivered either via social media or by professional publishing software. In both cases, the\n    metadata is routinely stripped, bye-bye C2PA. So one of the big jobs facing us in putting Content Credentials to work is to stop\n    publishers from deleting them.</p>\n    <p>Of course, that’s complicated. Professional publishers probably want the Content Credentials in place, but on social media\n    privacy is a key issue and stripping the metadata is arguably a good default choice. So there are a lot of policy discussions to\n    be had up front of the software work.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, let’s look at the C2PA. </p>\n    <img alt="Picture with two Content Credentials glyphs and one drop-down" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/ca-glyphs-1.png" />\n    <p>I open up that picture in Chrome and there are little “Cr” glyphs at both the top left and top right corners; that’s because\n    I’ve installed multiple C2PA Chrome plug-ins. Turns out these seem to only be available for Chrome, which is irritating. Anyhow,\n    I’ve clicked on the one in the top left.</p> \n    <p>That’s a little disappointing. It says the credentials were recorded by Lightroom, and gives my name, but I think it’s hiding\n    way more than it’s revealing. Maybe the one on the top right will be more informative?</p>\n    <img alt="Picture with two Content Credentials glyphs and one drop-down" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/ca-glyphs-2.png" />\n    <p>More or less the same info. A slightly richer presentation But both displays have an “inspect” button and both do the same\n    thing. Let’s click it!</p>\n    <img alt="Content Credentials inspector page, failing to retrieve a page for review" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/broken-inspector.png" />\n    <p>This is the Adobe Content Credentials inspector and it’s broken. That’s disappointing. Having said that, I was in a Discord\n    chat with a senior Adobe person this morning and they’re aware of the problem.</p>\n    <p>But anyhow, I can drag and drop the\n    picture like they say.</p>\n    <img alt="Content credentials as displayed by the Inspector" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/2-phase-c2pa.png" />\n    <p>Much much better. It turns out that this picture was originally taken with a Leica M11-P. The photographer is a famous software\n    guy named Rob Pike, who follows me on Mastodon and wanted to help out.</p>\n    <p>So, thanks Rob, and thanks also to the Leica store in Sydney, Australia, who loaned him the M11. He hasn’t told me how he\n    arranged that, but I’m curious.</p>\n    <p>I edited it in Lightroom, and if you look close, you can see that I cropped it down and brightened it up. Let’s zoom in on\n    the content credentials for the Leica image.</p>\n    <img alt="Leica-generated C2PA display" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/leica-cc.png" />\n    <p>There’s the camera model, the capture date (which is wrong because Rob didn’t get around to setting the camera’s date before\n    he took the picture.) The additional hardware (R-Adapter-M), the dimensions, ISO, focal length, and shutter speed.</p>\n    <p>Speaking as a photographer, this is kind of cool. There’s a problem in that it’s partly wrong. The focal length isn’t zero,\n    and Rob is pretty sure he didn’t have an adapter on. But Leica is trying to do the right thing and they’ll get there.</p>\n    <p>Now let’s look at the assertions that were added by Lightroom.</p>\n    <img alt="Lightroom-generated C2PA display" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/lr-cc.png" />\n    <p>There’s a lot of interesting stuff in here, particularly the provenance. Lightroom lets you manage your identities, using\n    what we call “OAuth flows”, so it can ask Instagram (with my permission) what my Instagram ID is. It goes even further with\n    LinkedIn; it turns out that LinkedIn has an integration with the Clear ID people, the ones who fast-track you at the airport. So\n    I set up a Clear ID, which required photos of my passport, and went through the dance with LinkedIn to link it up, and then with\n    Lightroom so it knew my LinkedIn ID. So to expand, what it’s really saying is: “Adobe says that LinkedIn says that Clear says\n    that the government ID of the person who posted this says that he’s named Timothy Bray”.</p>\n    <p>I don’t know about you, but this feels like pretty strong provenance medicine to me. I understand that the C2PA committee and\n    the\n    <a href="https://cawg.io">CAWG</a> people are re-working the provenance assertions. To them: Please don’t screw this particular\n    style of provenance up.</p>\n    <p>Now let’s look at what Lightroom says it did. It may be helpful to know what I in fact did.</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Cropped the picture down.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Used Lightroom’s “Dehaze” tool because it looked a little cloudy.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Adjusted the exposure and contrast, and boosted the blacks a bit.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Sharpened it up.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>Lightroom knows what I did, and you might wonder how it got from those facts to that relatively content-free\n    description that reads like it was written by lawyers.\n    Anyhow, I’d like to know. Since I’m a computer geek, I used the open-source “c2patool” to dump what the assertions\n    actually are.  I apologize if this hurts your eyes.</p>\n    <p>It turns out that there is way more data in those files than the inspector shows. For example, the Leica claims included 29\n    EXIF values, here are three I selected more or less at random:</p>\n    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p"></span><span class="w">          </span><span class="nt">"exif:ApertureValue"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"2.79917"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">          </span><span class="nt">"exif:BitsPerSample"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"16"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">          </span><span class="nt">"exif:BodySerialNumber"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"6006238"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n</pre></div>\n    <p>Some of these are interesting: In the Leica claims, the serial number. I could see that as a useful provenance claim. Or as a\n    potentially lethal privacy risk. Hmmm.</p>\n        <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p"></span><span class="w">            </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.color_adjustments"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.color_adjustments"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr.value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"60"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Exposure2012"</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="p">}</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">},</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.color_adjustments"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Sharpness"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr.value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"52"</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="p">}</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">},</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.cropped"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr.value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Rotated Crop"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Crop"</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="p">}</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n    <p>And in the Lightroom section, it actually shows exactly what I did, see the sharpness and exposure values.</p> \n    <p>My feeling is that the inspector is doing either too much or too little. At the minimal end you could just say “hand\n    processed? Yes/No” and “genAI? Yes/No”.  For a photo professional, they might like to drill down and see what I actually did. I\n    don’t see who would find the existing presentation useful. There’s clearly work to do in this space.</p>\n    <p>Oh wait, did I just say “AI”? Yes, yes I did. Let’s look at another picture, in this case a lousy picture.</p>\n    <img alt="Picture of an under-construction high-rise behind leaves" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/TXT55638.png" />\n    <p>I was out for a walk and thought the building behind the tree was interesting. I was disappointed when I pulled it up on the\n    screen, but I still liked the shape and decided to try and save it.</p>\n    <img alt="Picture of an under-construction high-rise behind leaves, improved" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/TXT55638-good.png" />\n    <p>So I used Lightroom’s “Select Sky” to recover its color, and “Select Subject” to pull the building details out of the\n    shadows. Both of these Lightroom features, which are pretty magic and I use all the time, are billed as being AI-based. I\n    believe it.</p>\n    <p>Let’s look at what the C2PA discloses.</p>\n    <img alt="Lightroom C2PA assertions with automation AI" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/lr-tower.png" />\n    <p>Having said all that, if you look at the C2PA (or at the data behind it) Lightroom discloses only “Color or Exposure”,\n    “Cropping”, and “Drawing” edits. Nothing about AI.</p>\n    <p>Hmm. Is that OK? I personally think it is, and highlights the distinction between what I’d call “automation” AI and\n    Generative AI. I mean, selecting the sky and subject is something that a skilled Photoshop user could accomplish with a lot of\n    tinkering, the software is just speeding things up. But I don’t know, others might disagree.</p>\n    <p>Well, how about that generative AI?</p>\n    <img alt="Turtle in shallow water, generated by ChatGPT" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/chatgpt.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>Fails <code>c2patool</code> validation, “DigitalSourceType” is <code>trainedAlgorithmicMedia</code></p></div>\n    <img alt="Desktop with decorations, Magic Erase has been applied" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/budai.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>“DigitalSourceType” is <code>compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia</code></p></div>\n    <p>The turtle is 100% synthetic, from ChatGPT, and on the right is a Pixel 10 shot on which I did a few edits including “Magic\n    Eraser”.  Both of these came with Content Credentials; chatGPT’s is actually invalid, but on the glass-half-full front, the\n    Pixel 10’s were also invalid up until a few days ago, then they fixed it. So this stuff does get fixed.</p>\n    <p>I’m happy about the consistent use of C2PA terminology, they are clearly marking the images as genAI-involved.</p>\n    <p>I’m about done talking about the state of the Content Credentials art generally but I should probably talk about this\n    device.</p>\n    <img alt="Blue Pixel 10" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/pixel-10.png" />\n    <p>Because it marks the arrival of Content Credentials on the mass consumer market. Nobody knows how many Pixels Google actually\n    sells but I guarantee it’s a lot more than Leica sells M11’s. And since Samsung tends to follow Google pretty closely, we’re\n    heading for tens then hundreds of millions of C2PA-generating mobile devices. I wonder when Apple will climb on board?</p>\n    <p>Let’s have a look at that C2PA.</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA associated with Magic Eraser image" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/p10-c2pa.png" />\n    <p>This view of the C2PA is from the Google Photos app.  It’s very limited.  In particular, there is nothing in there to support\n    provenance. In fact, it’s the opposite, Google is bending over backward to avoid anything that could be interpreted as breaking the\n    privacy contract by sharing information about the user.</p>\n    <p>Let’s pull back the covers and dig a little deeper. Here are a few notes</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>The device is identified just as “Pixel camera”. There are lots of different kinds of those!</p></li>\n      <li><p>The C2PA inclusion is Not optional!</p></li>\n      <li><p>DigitalSourceType:  <code>computationalCapture</code>\u2028(if no genAI)</p></li>\n      <li><p>Timestamp is “untrusted”</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>The C2PA not being optional removes a lot of UI issues but still, well, I’m not smart enough to have fully thought through\n    the implications. That Digital Source Type looks good and appropriate, and the untrusted-ness of the timestamp is\n    interesting.</p>\n    <p>You notice that my full-workflow examples featured a Leica rather than the Pixel, and that’s because the toolchain is\n    currently broken for me: Neither Lightroom nor Photoshop can handle the P10 C2PA. I’ll skip the details, except to say that\n    Adobe is aware of the bug, a version mismatch, and they say they’re working on it.</p>\n    <p>Before we leave the Pixel 10, I should say that there are plenty of alternate camera apps in Android and iOS, some quite\n    good, and it’d be perfectly possible for them to ship much richer C2PA, notably including provenance, location, and so on.</p>\n    <p>I guess that concludes my look at the current state of the Content Credentials art. Now I’d like to talk about what Content\n    Credentials are for.  To start with, I think it’d be helpful to sort the assertions into three baskets.</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA assertions in Capture, Processing, and Provenance baskets" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/3-baskets-1.png" />\n    <p>Capture, that’s like that Leica EXIF stuff we showed earlier. What kind of camera and lens, what the shooting parameters\n    were. Processing, that’s like the Lightroom report: How was the image manipulated, and by what software. Provenance: Which\n    person or organization produced this?</p>\n    <p>But I think this picture has an important oversimplification, let me fix that.</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA assertion baskets with the addition of GenAI" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/3-baskets-2.png" />\n    <p>Processing is logically where you’d disclose the presence of GenAI.  And in terms of what people practically care about,\n    that’s super important and deserves special consideration.</p>\n    <p>Now I’m going to leave the realm of facts and give you opinions. As for the Capture data there on the left… who cares?\n    Really, I’m trying to imagine a scenario in which anyone cares about the camera or lens or F stop.  I guess there’s an exception\n    if you want to prove that the photo was taken by one of Annie Liebowitz’s cameras, but that’s really provenance.</p>\n    <p>Let’s think about a professional publication scenario. They get photos from photographers, employees or agencies or\n    whatever. They might want to be really sure that the photo was from the photographer and not an imposter. So having C2PA\n    provenance would be nice. Then when the publisher gets photos, they do a routine check of the provenance and if it doesn’t check\n    out, they don’t run the picture without a close look first.</p>\n    <p>They also probably want to check for the “is there genAI?” indicator in the C2PA, and, well, I don’t know what they might do,\n    but I’m pretty sure they’d want to know.</p>\n    <p>That same publisher might want to equip the photos they publish with C2PA, to demonstrate that they are really the ones who\n    chose and provided the media. That assertion should be applied routinely by their content management system.  Which should be\n    easy, on the technology side anyhow.</p> \n    <p>So from the point of view of a professional publisher, provenance matters, and being careful about GenAI matters, and in the\n    C2PA domain, I think that’s all that really matters.</p>\n    <p>Now let’s turn to Social Media, which is the source of most of the images that most people see most days.  Today, all the\n    networks strip all the photo metadata, and that decision involves a lot of complicated privacy and intellectual-property\n    thinking.  But there is one important FACT that they know: For any new piece of media, they know which account uploaded the damn\n    thing, because that account owner had to log in to do it. So I think it’s a no-brainer that IF THE USER WISHES, they can have a\n    Content Credentials assertion in the photo saying “Initially uploaded by Tim Bray at LinkedIn” or whoever at wherever.</p> \n    <p>What we’d like to achieve is that if you see some shocking or controversial media, you’d really want to know who originally\n    posted it before you decided whether you believed it, and if Content Credentials are absent, that’s a big red flag. And if the\n    picture is of the current situation in Gaza, your reaction might be different depending on whether it was originally from an\n    Israeli military social-media account, or the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, or by the BBC, or by\n    igor282356057@popular.online.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, here’s how I see it:</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA assertion baskets inflated according to their relative importance" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/3-baskets-3.png" />\n    <p>So for me, it’s the P and A in C2PA that matter – provenance and authenticity. I think the technology has the potential to\n    change the global Internet conversation for the better, by making it harder for liars to lie and easier for truth-tellers to be\n    believed. I think the first steps that have been taken so far are broadly correct and the path forward is reasonably clear. All\n    the little things that are broken, we can fix ’em.</p>\n    <p>And there aren’t that many things that matter more than promoting truth and discouraging lies.</p>\n    <p>And that’s all, folks.</p>'}]}

This one scenic turn-off has you looking at a big, densely-forested mountainside. \n    It’s more chaotic than our West-Coast temperate rain forests, with many tree species jumbled together.

When I unloaded them on the\n    big outboard screen, I was disappointed with the Fujifilm take, which seemed a little flat and boring; was thinking the Pixel had\n    done better. But then I started feeling uneasy; my memory kept telling me that that mountainside just\n    didn’t include that yellow flavor in the Pixel’s highlights. I mean, those highlights look great, but I’m pretty sure they’re lies.</p>\n    <p>After a while, I edited the Fujifilm version just a teeny bit, gently bumping Lightroom’s “exposure” and “Vibrance” sliders, and\n    I thought what \n    I got was very close to what I remembered. The Pixel photo is entirely un-touched.</p>\n    <p>I’m not sure what to think. Mobile-phone cameras in general and the Pixel in particular proudly boast their “computational\n    photography” and “AI” chops and, yeah, the Pixel produced a photo that it’s hard not to like.</p>\n    <p>And quite a few of the pictures I publish in this space have have been adjusted pretty heavily in Lightroom.

It’s only ten pages long, and that’s\n    with all the IETF boilerplate. It’s written specifically for software and networking people.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">The smoking gun</h2>\n    <p>The badness that 9839 focuses on is “problematic characters”, so let’s start with a painful example of what that means.\n    Suppose you’re designing a protocol that uses JSON and one of your constructs has a <code>username</code> field.\n    Suppose you get this message (I omit all the non-<code>username</code> fields). It’s \n    a perfectly legal JSON text:</p>\n    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>\n  <span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">"username"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"\\u0000\\u0089\\uDEAD\\uD9BF\\uDFFF"</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>    </pre></div>\n    <p>Unpacking all the JSON escaping gibberish reveals that the value of the <code>username</code> field contains four \n    numeric “code points” identifying Unicode characters:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>The first code point is zero, in Unicode jargon <code>U+0000</code>. In human-readable text it\n      has no meaning, but it will interfere with the operation of certain programming languages.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Next is Unicode <code>U+0089</code>, official name “CHARACTER TABULATION WITH JUSTIFICATION”. It’s what Unicode calls a\n      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes">C1\n      control code</a>, inherited from ISO/IEC 6429:1992, adopted from \n      <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_5th_edition_june_1991.pdf">ECMA 48</a> (1991), which calls it\n      “HTJ” and says: <i>HTJ causes the contents of the active field (the field in the presentation component that contains the\n      active presentation position) to be shifted forward so that it ends at the character position preceding the\n      following character tabulation stop. The active presentation position is moved to that following character\n      tabulation stop. The character positions which precede the beginning of the shifted string are put into the\n      erased state.</i></p>\n      <p>Good luck with that.</p></li>\n      <li><p>The third code point, <code>U+DEAD</code>, in Unicode lingo, is an “unpaired surrogate”.  To understand,\n      you’d have to learn how Unicode’s much-detested\n      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF-16</a> encoding works.\n      I recommend not bothering.</p>\n      <p>All you need to know is that surrogates are only meaningful when they come in pairs in UTF-16 encoded text. There is\n      effectively no such text on the wire and thus no excuse for tolerating surrogates in your data. In fact, the UTF-8 specification\n      says that you mustn’t use UTF-8 to encode surrogates. But the real problem is that different libraries in different\n      programming languages don’t always do the same things when they encounter this sort of fœtid interloper.</p>    </li>\n      <li><p>Finally, <code>\\uD9BF\\uDFFF</code> is JSON for the code point <code>U+7FFFF</code>.\n      Unicode has a category called “noncharacter”, containing a few dozen code points that, for a variety of\n      reasons, some good, \n      don’t represent anything and must not be interchanged on the wire. <code>U+7FFFF</code> is one of those.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>The four code points in the example are all clearly problematic. \n    The just-arrived RFC 9839 formalizes the notion of “problematic” and\n    offers easy-to-cite language saying which of these problematic types you want to\n    exclude from your text fields. Which, if you’re going to use JSON, you should probably do.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Don’t blame Doug</h2>\n    <p>Doug Crockford I mean, the inventor of JSON.  If he (or I or really anyone careful) were inventing JSON now that Unicode is\n    mature, he’d have been fussier about its character repertoire. Having said that, we’re stuck with JSON-as-it-is forever, so we\n    need a good way to say which of the problematic characters we’re going to exclude even if JSON allows them.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">PRECISion</h2>\n    <p>You may find yourself wondering why the IETF waited until 2025 to provide help with Bad Unicode.\n    It didn’t; here’s\n    <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8264.html">RFC 8264</a>: <cite>PRECIS Framework: Preparation, Enforcement, and\n    Comparison of Internationalized Strings in Application Protocols</cite>; the first PRECIS predecessor was published in 2002.\n    8264 is 43 pages long, containing a <em>very</em>\n    thorough discussion of many more potential Bad Unicode issues than 9839 does.</p>\n    <p>Like 9839, PRECIS specifies subsets of the Unicode character repertoire and goes further, providing a mechanism for defining\n    more.</p>\n    <p>Having said that, PRECIS doesn’t seem to be very widely used by people who are defining new data structures and protocols. My\n    personal opinion is that there are two problems which make it hard to adopt. First, it’s large and \n    complex, with many moving parts, and requires careful study to understand. Developers are (for good reason) lazy.</p>\n    <p>Second, using PRECIS ties you to a specific version of Unicode. In particular, it forbids the use of the (nearly a million)\n    unassigned code points. Since each release of Unicode includes new code point assignments, that means that a sender and receiver\n    need to agree on exactly which version of Unicode they’re both going to use if they want reliably interoperable behavior. This\n    makes life difficult for anyone writing a general-purpose code designed to be used in lots of different applications.</p>\n    <p>I personally think that the only version of Unicode anybody wants to use is “as recent as possible”, so they can be confident\n    of having all the latest emojis.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, 9839 is simpler and dumber than PRECIS. But I think some people will find it useful and now the IETF agrees.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">Source code</h2>\n    <p>I’ve written a little Go-language library to validate incoming text fields against each of the three subsets that 9839\n    specifies,\n    <a href="https://github.com/timbray/RFC9839">here</a>.  I don’t claim it’s optimal, but it is well-tested.</p>\n    <p>It doesn’t have a version number or release just yet, I’ll wait till a few folk have had a chance to spot any dumb mistakes I\n    probably made.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-9">Details</h2>\n    <p>Here’s a compact summary of the world of problematic Unicode code points and data formats and standards.</p>\n    <table>\n      <tr align="center" valign="top"><td class="empty"></td><th colspan="3">Problematic classes excluded?</th></tr>\n      <tr valign="top"><td class="empty"></td><th>Surrogates</th><th>Legacy controls</th><th>Noncharacters</th></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>CBOR</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>I-JSON</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="happy">yes</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>JSON</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>Protobufs</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>TOML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>XML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="neutral">partial [1]</td><td class="neutral">partial [2]</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>YAML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="neutral">mostly [3]</td><td class="neutral">partial [2]</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center" valign="top"><td class="empty"></td><th colspan="3">RFC 9839 Subsets</th></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>Scalars</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>XML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="neutral">partial</td><td class="neutral">partial</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>Assignables</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="happy">yes</td></tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>Notes:</p>\n    <p><b>[1]</b> XML allows C1 controls.</p>\n    <p><b>[2]</b> XML and YAML don’t exclude the noncharacters outside the Basic Multilingual Pane.</p>\n    <p><b>[3]</b> YAML excludes all the legacy controls except for the mostly-harmless <code>U+0085</code>, another version of\n    <code>\\n</code> used in IBM mainframe documents.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">Thanks!</h2>\n    <p>9839 is not a solo production.

My sincere thanks go to my\n    co-editor Paul Hoffman and to all those mentioned in the RFC’s “Acknowledgements” section.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">On individual submissions</h2>\n    <p>9839 is the second “individual submission” RFC I’ve pushed through the IETF (the other is\n    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7725">RFC 7725</a>, which registers the HTTP 451 status code).  While it’s nice\n    to decide something is worth standardizing and eventually have that happen, it’s really a lot of work. Some of that work is\n    annoying.</p>\n    <p>I’ve been involved in\n    other efforts as Working-Group member, WG chair, and WG specification editor, and I can report authoritatively that creating an\n    RFC the traditional way, through a Working Group, is easier and better.</p>\n    <p>I feel discomfort advising others not to follow in my footsteps, but in this case I think it’s the right advice.</p>'}]}

Then I ran across the 2019 book\n    <a href="https://www.biblioasis.com/shop/non-fiction/bush-runner-the-life-and-times-of-pierre-esprit-radisson/">Bush Runner:\n    The Adventures of Pierre-Esprit Radisson</a> and, wow… The writing is pedestrian but who cares because what a\n    story! Radisson lived an absolutely astonishing life. He went as deep into the bush as anyone of his era, interacted intensely\n    with the indigenous people as business partner, friend, and foe, worked for Charles of England and Louis of France (changing\n    sides several times), in 1670 founded the Hudson’s Bay Company (recently, 355 years later, deceased), and fortunately took\n    notes, a copy of which was preserved by Samuel Pepys.</p>\n    <p>I learned more from this book’s pages about the early history of Upper and Lower Canada than all those elementary-school\n    units had to offer, and had loads of fun doing so.  I guess this is a fairly Canadian-specific Long Link, but I think anyone\n    interested in the early history of Europeans in North America would find much to enjoy.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Music</h2>\n    <p>It’s rare these days that I discover interesting new musicians, but here are two of those rarities.</p>\n    <p><a href="https://luciehorsch.com">Lucie Horsch</a> plays recorder, you know, the cheap plastic thing they use to introduce\n    second-graders to music. It’s actually a lovely instrument and I wish we would switch to its German name, \n    “Blockflöte”, which to my ear sounds a bit like the instrument does. Anyhow, check out this YouTube entitled only\n    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJyl2D16PZY&amp;list=RDLJyl2D16PZY&amp;start_radio=1">Lucie Horsch\xa0-\xa0Bach</a>,\n    annoyingly omitting any mention of <em>which</em> Bach. Annoyance aside, it’s a pretty great performance, Ms Horsch is the real\n    deal, full of virtuosity and grace.</p>\n    <p>I got an unusual mid-week message from Qobuz, all excited about \n    <a href="https://transgressiverecords.com/artist/the-new-eves/">The New Eves’</a> new record <cite>The New Eve Is\n    Rising</cite>. So I played it in the car on a long crosstown drive and now I’m all excited too. The New Eves are\n    talented, musically surprising, and above all, insanely brave.</p>\n    <p>Their music doesn’t sound like anything else and\n    flies in the face of all conventional wisdom concerning popular music. They take absurd chances and yeah, the album has klunkers\n    amid the bangers, but when I got to its end I went back and started at the beginning again. I found myself\n    smiling ear-to-ear over and over.

But increasingly, using Google apps feels like being in enemy territory. And, as I said last time, I\n    will not be sorry to shake the dust of Google Drive and Docs from my heels, I find them clumsy and am \n    always having trouble finding something that I know is in there.</p>\n    <p>While I haven’t dug in seriously yet, I keep hearing reasonably-positive things about Proton, and nothing substantive to\n    scare me away.  Wish us luck.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-17">Data sharing (progress!)</h2>\n    <p>Dropbox is, eh, OK. It doesn’t seem actively evil, there’s no advertising, and the price is low.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-21">Photos</h2>\n    <p>We’re a four-Android family including a couple of prolific photographers, and everything just gets pumped into Google and\n    then it fills up and then they want more money.  If we could configure the phones to skip Google and go straight to Dropbox,\n    that would be a step forward.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-16">Video meetings</h2>\n    <p>Google meet isn’t painful but I totally suspect it of data-mining what should be private conversations. I’m getting the\n    feeling that the technical difficulty of videoconferencing is going steadily down, so I’m reasonably optimistic that\n    something a little less evil will come along with a fair price.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-10">Maps</h2>\n    <p>The fear and loathing that \n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/06/29/Fear-Google-Reviews">I started feeling in 2017</a> grows only stronger.  But replacements\n    aren’t obvious.\n    It’s a pity, maps\n    and directions and reviews feel like a natural monopoly that should be a public utility or something, rather than a corporate moat.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Browser (progress!)</h2>\n    <p>Chrome has seriously started making my flesh crawl; once again, enemy territory. Fortunately, there are lots of good options.\n    Even people like us who have multiple lives we need to keep separate can find enough better browsers out there.</p>\n    <p>Maybe I’ll have a look at one of the new genAI-company browsers ha ha just kidding.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-12">Search</h2>\n    <p>The reports on Kagi keep being positive and giving it a try is definitely on the To-Do list.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">Chat</h2>\n    <p>Signal is the only sane choice at this point in history for personal use.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Photo editing</h2>\n    <p>Adobe’s products are good, and I’m proficient and happy with Lightroom, but they are definitely suffering from bad genAI\n    craziness. Also the price is becoming unreasonable.</p>\n    <p>I’ve had a few Lightroom software failures in recent months and if that\n    becomes a trend, looking seriously at the alternatives will move to the top of the priority list.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">In-car interface</h2>\n    <p>It’s tough, Android Auto is a truly great product. I think I’m stuck here for now, particularly given that I plan to be\n    driving a <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/The%20World/Jaguar%20Diary/">2019-model-year car</a> for the foreseeable future. Also, it\n    supports my music apps.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-9">Discover music and play mine (progress!)</h2>\n    <p>Progress here. I’ve almost completely stopped using YouTube Music in favor of Plex and Qobuz. Really no downside; YTM has\n    more or less completely lost the ability to suggest good new stuff.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-13">TV</h2>\n    <p>Video continues morphing itself into Cable TV redux. We have an old Roku box that works fine and I think I’ve managed to find\n    its don’t-spy-on-us settings. We’ll keep subscribing to Apple+ as long as they keep shipping great shows.  I have zero regrets\n    about having\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/03/06/Canceled-Prime">left Prime behind</a>.</p>\n    <p>As for the rest, we’ve become migrants,\n    exclusively month-at-a-time subscriptions for the purpose of watching some serial or sports league, unsubscribe after the season\n    finale or championship game. The good news is that I\n    haven’t encountered much friction in unsubscribing, just a certain amount of earnest pleading.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-20">Looking forward</h2>\n    <p>I have yet to confront any of the really hard parts of this project, but the sense of urgency is increasing. Let’s see.</p>'}]}

This ramble doesn’t exactly have a smooth story arc but I’m\n    posting it anyhow because I know there are people\n    out there interested in state-machine engineering and they are my people.</p>\n    <p>As far as I can tell, a couple of the problems I’m trying to solve\n    haven’t been addressed before, at least not by anyone who published their findings.\n    Partly because of that, I’m starting to wonder if all\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/Technology/Quamina%20Diary/">these disorderly Quamina postings</a> might\n    be worked into a small book or monograph or something. State machines are really freaking useful software constructs!\n    So yeah, this is a war story not an essay, but if you like finite automata you’ll likely be interested in bits of it.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-1">The story thus far</h2>\n    <p>Prior to beginning work on Regular Expressions, I’d already wired shell-style “<code>*</code>” wildcards into Quamina, which\n    forced me to start working with NFAs and ε-transitions. The implementation wasn’t crushingly difficult, and\n    the performance was… OK-ish.</p>\n    <p>Which leads me to The Benchmark From Hell.\n    I wondered how the wildcard functionality would work under heavy stress, so I pulled in a list of 12,959 five-letter strings\n    from the Wordle source code, and inserted a “<code>*</code>” at a random position in each. Here are the first ten:</p>\n    <blockquote><pre><code>aalii*\n*aargh\naar*ti\nabaca*\na*baci\na*back\nab*acs\nab*aft\nabak*a</code></pre></blockquote>\n    <p>I created an NFA for each and merged them together\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/07/28/Union-of-Finite-Automata">as described here</a>. Building and merging the automata were\n    plenty fast enough, and the merged NFA had 46,424 states, which felt reasonable.\n    Matching strings against it ran at under ten thousand per second, which is pretty poor given that Quamina can do a million or\n    two per second on patterns encoded in a DFA.</p>\n    <p>But, I thought, still reasonably usable.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">The cursed “<code>?</code>”</h2>\n    <p>Last year, my\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/12/12/Quamina-Regular-Expression-Series">slow grind through the regexp features</a> had led me\n    to the zero-or-one quantifier “<code>?</code>”.  The state machine for these things is not rocket science; there’s a discussion\n    with pictures in my recent\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Epsilon-Wrangling#p-3">Epsilon Wrangling</a>.</p>\n    <p>So I implemented that and fired off the unit tests, most of which\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/12/12/QRS-Parsing-Regular-Expressions#p-1">I didn’t have to write</a>, and they all failed.\n    Not a surprise I guess.</p>\n    <p>It turned out that the way I’d implemented ε-transitions for the wildcards\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/07/28/Union-of-Finite-Automata#p-9">was partially wrong</a>, as in it worked for the tight-loop\n    state-to-itself ε-transitions, but not for more general-purpose things like “<code>?</code>” requires.</p>\n    <p>In fact, it turns out that merging NFAs is hard (DFAs are easy), and I found precious little help online.\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson%27s_construction">Thompson’s construction</a> does give an answer: Make an\n    otherwise-empty state with two ε-transitions, one to each of the automata, and it’ll do the right thing. Let’s call that\n    a “splice state”. It’s easy to implement, so I did. Splicing is hardly “merging” in the Quamina sense, but still.</p>\n    <p>Unfortunately, the performance was hideously bad, just a few matches per second while pegging the CPU.\n    A glance at the final NFA was sobering; endless chains of splice states, some thousands long.</p>\n    <p>At this point\n    I became very unhappy and got stalled for months dealing with real-life issues while this problem lurked at the back\n    of my mind, growling for attention occasionally.</p>\n    <p>Eventually I let the growler out of the cave and started to think through approaches. But first…</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Worth solving?</h2>\n    <p>Is it, really? What sane person is going to want to search for the union of thousands of regular expressions in general or\n    wild-carded strings in particular?</p>\n    <p>I didn’t think about this problem at all, because of my experience with Quamina’s parent,\n    <a href="https://github.com/aws/event-ruler">Ruler</a>. When it became popular among several AWS and Amazon teams, people\n    sometimes found it useful to match the union of not just thousands but a million or more different patterns. When you write\n    software that anyone actually uses, don’t expect the people using it to share your opinions on what is and isn’t\n    reasonable. So I wasn’t going to get any mental peace until I cracked this nut.</p>\n    <p>I eventually decided that three approaches were worth trying:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Figure out a way really to merge, not just splice, the wildcarded patterns, to produce a simpler automaton.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Optimize the NFA-traversal code path.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Any NFA can be transformed into a DFA, says computer-science theory. So do that, because Quamina is really fast at\n      DFA-based matching.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <h2 id="p-5">Nfa2Dfa</h2>\n    <p>I ended up doing all of these things and haven’t entirely given up on any of them.\n    The most intellectually-elegant was the transform-to-DFA approach, because if I did that, I could remove the fairly-complex\n    NFA-traversal logic from Quamina.</p>\n    <p>It turns out that the Net is rich with textbook extracts and YouTubes and slide-shows about how to do the NFA-to-DFA\n    conversion. It ended up being quite a pleasing little chunk of code, only a couple hundred lines.</p>\n    <p>The bad news: Converting each individual wildcard NFA to a DFA was amazingly fast, but then as I merged them in one by one,\n    the number of automaton states started increasing explosively and the process slowed down so much that I never had the patience\n    to let it finish. Finite-automata theory warns that this can happen, but it’s hard to characterize the cases where it does.\n    I guess this one of them.</p>\n    <p>Having said that, I haven’t discarded the <code>nfa2Dfa</code> code, because perhaps I ought to offer a Quamina option to\n    apply this if you have some collection of patterns that you want to run really super fast and are willing to wait for a while\n    for the transformation process to complete. Also, I may have missed opportunities to optimize the conversion; maybe it’s making\n    more states than it needs to?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Faster NFA traversal</h2>\n    <p>Recently in\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Epsilon-Wrangling">Epsilon wrangling</a> I described how NFA traversal has to work,\n    relying heavily on implementing a thing called an ε-closure.</p>\n    <p>So I profiled the traversal process and discovered, unsurprisingly, that most of the time was going into memory allocation\n    while computing those ε-closures. So now Quamina has an ε-closure cache and will only compute each one once.</p>\n    <p>This helped a lot but not nearly enough, and the profiler was still telling me the pain was in Go’s allocation and\n    garbage-collection machinery. Whittling away at this kind of stuff is not rocket science. The standard Go trick I’ve seen over\n    and over is to keep all your data in slices, keep re-using them then chopping them back to <code>[:0]</code>\n    for each request.  After a while they’ll have grown to the\n    point where all the operations are just copying bytes around, no allocation required.</p>\n    <p>Which also helped, but the speed wasn’t close to what I wanted.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">Merging wildcard automata</h2>\n    <p>I coded multiple ways to do this, and they kept failing. But I eventually found a way to build those\n    automata so that any two of them, or any one of them and a DFA, can merged and generate dramatically\n    fewer ε-transition chains.  I’m not going to write this up here for two reasons: First of all, it’s not <em>that</em>\n    interesting, and second, I worry that I may have to change the approach further as I go on implementing new regxp operators.</p>\n    <p>In particular, at one point I was looking at the code while it wasn’t working, and I could see that if I added a particular\n    conditional it would work, but I couldn’t think of a principled reason to do it. Obviously I’ll have to sort this out\n    eventually. In the meantime, if you’re the sort of um special person who is now burning with curiosity, check out my branch from\n    that PR and have a look at the <code>spinout</code> type.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, I added that conditional even though it puzzled me a bit, and now you can add wildcard patterns to Quamina at 80K/second,\n    and my 12.9K wildcards generate an NFA with with almost 70K states, which can scan events at almost 400K/second. And that’s good\n    enough to ship the <code>“?”</code> feature.</p>\n    <p>By the way, I tried feeding that 70K-state automaton to the DFA converter, and gave up after it’d burned an hour of CPU and\n    grown to occupy many GB of RAM.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">Next steps</h2>\n    <p>Add “<code>+</code>” and “<code>*</code>”, and really hope I don’t have to redesign the NFA machinery again.</p>\n    <p>Also, figure out the explanation for that puzzling <code>if</code> statement.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-9">And I should say…</h2>\n    <p>Despite the very narrow not to say obsessive focus of this series, I’ve gotten a few bits and pieces of positive feedback. So\n    there are a few people out there who care about this stuff. To all of you, thanks.</p>'}]}

Her right arm was\n    swollen, bruised, and painful. The skin and adjacent blood vessels of very old people become thin and fragile; her whole\n    forearm was a bruise. I tried to get her to go to Emergency but she wasn’t having any of it: “You wait for hours and then they\n    give you a pain-killer, which is constipating.”  Since she could twist her wrist and wiggle her fingers and give my hand a firm\n    grasp, I didn’t push too hard.</p>\n    <p>A couple days later on Saturday she got her regular twice-a-week visit from the public\n    <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/health/accessing-health-care-services/care-at-home-and-outside-the-hospital/home-care">HomeCare</a>\n    nurse, a friendly and highly competent Nigerian immigrant, to check her meds and\n    general condition.\n    She looked at Mom’s wrist and said “Get her an appointment with her doctor, they’ll probably want an X-Ray.”</p>\n    <p>I called up her doctor at opening time Monday. The guy who answered the phone said\n    “Don’t have any appointments for a couple weeks but come on over, we’ll squeeze her in.” So we went in after morning coffee and\n    waited less than an hour.\n    The doctor looked at her arm for 45 seconds and said “I’m writing a prescription for an X-Ray” and there was a\n    radiologist around the corner and she was in ten minutes later. The doctor called me back that afternoon and said “Your\n    mother’s got a broken wrist, I got her an 8AM appointment tomorrow at Regina General’s Cast Clinic.”</p>\n    <p>The doctor at the clinic looked at her wrist for another 45 seconds and said “Yeah, put on a cast” so they did and we were\n    home by ten. I’d pessimistically overpaid a couple bucks for hospital parking.</p>\n    <p>The reason I’m including this is because I notice that this space has plenty of American readers. Did you notice that the\n    story entirely omits insurance companies and money (except parking)? In Canada your health-care comes with your taxes (granted,\n    higher than Americans’) and while the system is far from perfect, it can fix up an old lady’s broken wrist pretty damn fucking\n    quick without any bureaucratic bullshit. Also, Canada spends a huge amount less per head on health-care than the US does.</p>\n    <p>And Mom told me not to forget that Saskatchewan is the birthplace of Canadian single-payer universal healthcare.\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Douglas">Tommy Douglas</a>, the Social Democrat who made that happen, has been\n    named\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_Canadian">The Greatest Canadian</a>.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Gentle surface</h2>\n    <p>Oh, did I say “flat and brown and empty”? Wrong, wrong, and wrong. The Prairies, in Canada and the US too, have textures and\n    colors and hills and valleys, it’s just that the slopes are gentle.  There are really flat parts and they make farmers’ lives easier, but\n    more or less every square inch that’s not a town or a park is farmed.\n    I took Mom for a drive out in the country southeast of Regina, from whence these views:</p>\n    <img alt="A road leading slightly uphill, brilliant yellow canola on both sides" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/TXT55698.png" />\n    <img alt="Yellow canola flowers under a blue sky" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/TXT55700.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>Note that in both shots we’re looking up a gentle slope. In the second, there’s farm infrastructure on\n    the distant horizon.<br />Also consider the color of the sky.</p></div>\n    <p>In Canada that yellow-flowering crop is called “Canola”, which Wikipedia claims refers to a particular cultivar of \n    <i>Brassica napus</i>, commonly known as rapeseed or just rape, so you can see why when Canada’s\n    agribiz sector wanted to position its oil as the thing to use while cooking they went for the cultivar not the species\n    name. I’m old enough to remember when farmers still said just “rapeseed”. Hmm, Wikipedia also claims that the OED claims this:\n    The term “rape” derives from the Latin word for turnip, <i>rāpa</i> or <i>rāpum</i>, cognate with the Greek word ῥάφη,\n    <i>rhaphe</i>.</p>\n    <p>Let’s stick with canola.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Pixelated color</h2>\n    <p>After I’d taken those two canola-field shots I pulled out my Pixel and took another, but I’m not gonna share it because the\n    Pixel decided to turn the sky from what I thought was a complex and interesting hue into its opinion of “what a blue sky looks\n    like” only this sky didn’t.</p>\n    <p>Maybe it’s just me, but I think Google’s camera app is becoming increasingly opinionated about color, and not in a good\n    way. There are plenty of alternative camera apps, I should check them out.</p>\n    <p>In case it’s not obvious, I love photographing Saskatchewan and think it generally looks pretty great, especially when you\n    look up. On the province’s license plates it says “Land of living skies”, and no kidding.</p> \n    <img alt="Saskatchewan’s living skies" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250704_032320050.png" />\n    <img alt="Saskatchewan’s living skies" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250704_032334240.png" />\n    <img alt="Saskatchewan’s living skies" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/TXT55717.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>The first two are from the park behind Mom’s place,<br />the third from that mini-mountain mentioned\n    above.</p></div>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Experience and memory</h2>\n    <p>My Mom’s doing well for a nonagenerian. She’s smart. When I visited early last fall and we talked about the US election I was\n    bullish on Kamala Harris’s chances. She laughed at me and said “The Americans won’t elect a woman.” Well then.</p>\n    <p>But she’s forgetful in the short term. I took her to the Legislature’s\n    garden and to the top of the mini-mountain and for a drive out in the country and another adventure we’ll get to; she\n    enjoyed them all. But maybe she won’t remember them.</p>\n    <p>“Make memories” they say, but what if you show someone you love a good time and maybe they won’t remember it the\n    next day? I’m gonna say it’s still worthwhile and has a lesson to teach about what matters. There endeth the lesson.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">The gallery</h2>\n    <p>Indigenous people make up 17% of Regina’s population, the highest share in any significant Canadian city. By “indigenous” I\n    mean the people that my ancestors stole the land from.  It’s personal with me; Around 1900, my Dad’s family, Norwegian\n    immigrants, took over some pretty\n    great farmland southeast of Edmonton by virtue of “homesteading”, such a <em>nice</em> word isn’t it?</p>\n    <p>Regina tries to honor its indigenous heritage and my favorite expression of that is its\n    <a href="https://mackenzie.art">Mackenzie Art Gallery</a>, a lovely welcoming space in the\n    <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/directory?ou=a8e54600-77d6-4b7e-9702-f07a3dac1b47">T.C.Douglas building</a> (for\n    “T.C.” read “Tommy”. (Did I mention him?) Mom and I walked around it and had lunch in its very decent café.</p>\n    <p>Every time I’ve been there the big exhibitions in the big rooms have been indigenous-centered, and generally excellent.\n    I try to go every time I visit and I’ve never been disappointed.</p>\n    <img alt="Indigenous art at Regina’s Mackenzie Gallery" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250708_172437441.png" />\n    <p>In 2025, anything I have to say about this piece would be superfluous.</p>\n    <img alt="Every American Flag Is A Warning Sign" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250708_173041377.png" />\n    <p>I love modern-art galleries, especially with big rooms full of big pieces, even if I don’t like all the art.\n    Because it feels good to be in the presence of the work of people who are pouring out\n    what they have to offer, especially at large scale. If the task wasn’t hard enough that failures\n    are common then it wouldn’t be worthwhile, would it?</p>\n    <p>They’re especially great when there’s someone I love there enjoying it with me. Here’s Mom.</p>\n    <img alt="Jean Bray considers indigenous art" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250708_172836385.png" />\n    <p>These days, any visit might be the last.

A commenter pointed out that the definition of “epsilon”\n    in that piece is not quite right per standard finite-automata theory, but it’s still a useful in that it describes how\n    epsilons support constructs like the shell-style “<code>*</code>”.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Background</h2>\n    <p>Finite automata come in two flavors: Deterministic (DFA) and Nondeterministic (NFA).  DFAs move from state to state one input\n    symbol at a time: it’s simple and easy to understand and to implement.\n    NFAs have two distinguishing characteristics: First, when you’re in a\n    state and an input symbol arrives, you can transfer to more than one other state. Second, a state can have “epsilon transitions”\n    (let’s say “ε” for epsilon), which can happen any time at all while you’re in that state, input or no input.</p>\n    <p>NFAs are more complicated to traverse (will discuss below) but you need them if you want to\n    implement regular expressions with <code>.</code> and <code>?</code> and <code>*</code> and so on. You can turn any NFA into a\n    DFA, and I’ll come back to that subject in a future piece.</p>\n    <p>For implementing NFAs, I’ve been using\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson%27s_construction">Thompson\'s construction</a>, where\n    “Thompson” is\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>, co-parent of Unix. This technique is also nicely\n    described by Russ Cox in \n    <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast</a>. You don’t need to\n    learn it to understand this piece, but I’ll justify design\n    choices by saying “per Thompson”.</p>\n    <p>I’m going to discuss two specific issues today, ε-closures and a simpler NFA definition.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">ε-closures</h2>\n    <p>To set the stage, consider this regexp: <code>A?B?C?X</code></p>\n    <p>It should match “X” and “BX” and “ACX” and so on, but not “CAX” or “XX”.\n    Thompson says that you implement <code>A?</code> with a\n    transition to the next state on “A” and another ε-transition to that next state; because if you see an “A” you should transition,\n    but then you can transition anyhow even if you don’t.</p>\n    <p>The resulting NFA looks like this:</p>\n    <img alt="NFA matching A?B?C?X" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/AcmBcmCcmX.png" />\n    <p> In finite-automaton\n    math, states are usually represented by the letter “q” followed by a number (usually italicized and subscripted, like\n    <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>, but not here, sorry). Note <code>q4</code>’s double circle which means it’s\n    a goal state, i.e. if we get here we’ve matched the regexp.\n    I should add that this was produced with\n    <a href="https://draw.io">draw.io</a>, which seems to make this sort of thing easy.\n    </p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">Back to that NFA</h2>\n    <p>So, here’s a challenge: Sketch out the traversal code in your head. Think about the input strings “AX” and “BCX” and just “X”\n    and how you’d get through the NFA to the Q4 goal state.</p>\n    <p>The trick is what’s called the ε-closure. When you get to a state, before you look at the next input symbol, you have to set\n    up to process it. In this case, you need to be able to transition on an A or B or C. So what you do is pull together the\n    start state <code>q0</code> and also any other states you can reach from there through ε-transitions. In this case, the ε-closure\n    for the start state is <code>{q0,\xa0q1,\xa0q2,\xa0q3}</code>.</p>\n    <p>Suppose, then, that you see a “B” input symbol. You apply it to all the states in the ε-closure. Only <code>q1</code> matches,\n    transitioning you to\n    <code>q2</code>. Before you look at the next input symbol, you compute the ε-closure for <code>q2</code>, which turns\n    out to be <code>{q2,\xa0q3}</code>. With this ε-closure, you can match “C” or “X”. If you get a “C”, you”ll step to\n    <code>q3</code>, whose ε-closure is just itself, because “X” is the only path forward.</p>\n    <p>So your NFA-traversal algorithm for one step becomes something like:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Start with a list of states.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Compute the ε-closure of that list.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Read an input symbol.</p></li>\n      <li><p>For each state in the ε-closure, see if you can traverse to another state.</p></li>\n      <li><p>If so, add it to your output list of states.</p></li>\n      <li><p>When you’re done, your output list of states is the input to this algorithm for the next step.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Computation issues</h2>\n    <p>Suppose your regular expression is <code>(A+BC?)+</code>. I’m not going to sketch out the NFA, but just looking at it tells\n    you that it has to have loopbacks; once you’ve matched the parenthetized chunk you need to go back to a state where you can\n    recognize another occurrence.\n    For this regexp’s NFA, computing the ε-closures can lead you into an infinite loop. (Should be obvious, but I didn’t realize it until\n    after the first time it happened.)</p>\n    <p>You can have loops and you can also have dupes. In practice, it’s not that uncommon for a state to have more than one\n    ε-transition, and for the targets of these transitions to overlap.</p>\n    <p>So you need to watch for loops and to dedupe your output. I think the only way to avoid this is with a cookie-crumbs\n    “where I’ve been” trail, either as a list or a hash table.</p> \n    <p>Both of these are problematic because they require allocating memory, and that’s something you really don’t want to do when\n    you’re trying to match patterns to events at Quamina’s historic rate of millions per second.</p>\n    <p>I’ll dig into this problem in a future Quamina-Diary outing, but obviously, caching computed\n    epsilon closures would avoid re-doing this computation.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, bear ε-closures in mind, because they’ll keep coming up as this series goes on.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">And finally, simplifying “NFA”</h2>\n    <p>At the top of this piece, I offered the standard definition of NFAs: First, when you’re in a\n    state and an input symbol arrives, you can transfer to more than one other state. Second, you can have ε-transitions.\n    Based on my recent work, I think this definition is redundant. Because if you need to transfer to two different states on some\n    input symbol, you can do that with ε-transitions.</p>\n    <p>Here’s a mini-NFA that transfers from state <code>q0</code> on “A” to both <code>q1</code> and <code>q2</code>.</p>\n    <img alt="An NFA transferring to two different states on an input symbol" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Splice-1.png" />\n    <p>And here’s how you can achieve the same effect with ε-transitions:</p>\n    <img alt="Transferring to two destinations using ε-transitions" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Splice-2.png" />\n    <p>In that NFA, in <code>qS</code> the “S” stands for “splice”, because it’s a state that exists to connect\n    two threads of finite-automaton traversal.</p>\n    <p>I’m pretty sure that this is more than just a mathematical equivalence. In my regexp implementation, so far at least,\n    I’ve never encountered a need to do that first kind of dual transition.

They’re doing this for exactly one\n    reason: They think they can discard armies of employees and replace them with LLM services, at the cost of\n    shipping shittier products.  Do you think your management would spend that kind of money to help you with a quicker first draft or\n    a summarized inbox?</p>\n    <p>Adobe said the quiet part out loud:\n    <a href="https://petapixel.com/2024/05/03/adobe-throws-photographers-under-the-bus-again-skip-the-photoshoot/">Skip the\n    Photoshoot</a>. </p>\n    <p>At this point someone will point out that previous technology waves have generated as much employment as they’ve eliminated.\n    Maybe so, but that’s not what business leaders think they’re buying. They think they’re buying smaller payrolls.</p>\n    <p>Maybe I’m overly sensitive, but thinking about these truths leads to a mental stench that makes me want to stay away from\n    it.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">How much does genAI cost?</h2>\n    <p>Well, I already mentioned all those hundreds of billions. But that’s pocket change. The investment community in general and\n    Venture Capital in particular will whine and moan, but the people who are losing the money are people who can afford to.</p>\n    <p>The first real cost is hypothetical: What if those business leaders are correct and they can gleefully dispose of millions of\n    employees? If you think we’re already suffering from egregious levels of inequality, what happens when a big chunk of the\n    middle class suddenly becomes professionally superfluous?  I’m no economist so I’ll stop there, but you don’t have to be a\n    rocket scientist to predict severe economic pain.</p>\n    <p>Then there’s the other thing that nobody talks about, the massive greenhouse-gas load that all those data centers are going\n    to be pumping out. This at a time when we we blow past one atmospheric-carbon metric after another and David Suzuki says\n    <a href="https://www.ipolitics.ca/2025/07/02/its-too-late-david-suzuki-says-the-fight-against-climate-change-is-lost/">the\n    fight against climate change is lost</a>, that we need to hunker down and work on survival at the local level.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">The real problem</h2>\n    <p>It’s the people who are pushing it.  Their business goals are quite likely, as a side-effect, to make\n    the world a worse place, and they don’t give a fuck.  Their technology will inevitably worsen the onrushing climate catastrophe,\n    and they don’t give a fuck.</p>\n    <p>It’s probably not as simple as “They’re just shitty people”<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009it’s not exactly easy to escape the\n    exigencies of modern capitalism.

The impact of\n    <em>anything</em> on coding\n    is hard to measure systematically, so we rely on anecdata and the community’s eventual consensus.\n    So, here’s my anecdata. Tl;dr: The AI was not useless.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-1">The problem</h2>\n    <p>My current work on\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/Technology/Quamina%20Diary/">Quamina</a> involves dealing with collections of finite-automata states,\n    which, in the Go programming language, are represented as slices of pointers to state instances:</p>\n    <blockquote><p><code>[]*faState</code></p></blockquote>\n    <p>The problem I was facing was deduping them, so that there would be only one instance corresponding to any particular\n    collection. This is what, in Java, the <code>intern()</code> call does with strings.</p>\n    <p>The algorithm isn’t rocket science:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Dedupe the states, i.e. turn the collection into a set.</p></li>\n      <li><p>For each set of states, generate a key.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Keep a hash table of sets around, and use the key to see whether you’ve already got such a set, and if so return\n      it. Otherwise, make a new entry in the hash table and return that.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>I’m out of touch with the undergrad CS curriculum, but this feels like a second-year assignment or thereabouts? Third?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Enter Claude</h2>\n    <p>So I prompted Claude thus:</p>\n    <blockquote><p>I need Go code to provide a "intern"-like function for lists of pointers. For example, if I have several\n    different []*int arrays, which may contain duplicates, I want to call intern() on each of them and get back a single canonical\n    pointer which is de-duplicated and thus a set.</p></blockquote>\n    <p>Claude did pretty well. It got the algorithm right, the code was idiomatic and usefully commented, and it also provided a\n    decent unit test (but in a <code>main()</code> stanza rather than a proper Go test file).\n    I didn’t try actually running it.</p>\n    <p>The interesting part was the key computation. I, being lazy, had just done a Go <code>fmt.Sprintf("%p")</code>\n    incantation to get a hex string representing each state’s address, sorted them, joined them, and that was the key.</p>\n    <p>Claude worked with the pointers more directly.</p>\n    <pre><code>\t// Sort by pointer address for consistent ordering\n\tsort.Slice(unique, func(i, j int) bool {\n\t\treturn uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(unique[i])) &lt; uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(unique[j]))\n\t})</code></pre>\n    <p>Then it concatenated the raw bytes of the map addresses and lied to Go by claiming it was a string.</p>\n    <pre><code>\t// Create key from pointer addresses\n\tkey := make([]byte, 0, len(slice)*8)\n\tfor _, ptr := range slice {\n\t\taddr := uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(ptr))\n\t\t// Convert address to bytes\n\t\tfor i := 0; i &lt; 8; i++ {\n\t\t\tkey = append(key, byte(addr&gt;&gt;(i*8)))\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn string(key)</code></pre>\n\t<p>This is an improvement in that the keys will be half the size of my string version.\n\tI didn’t copy-paste Claude’s code wholesale, just replaced ten or so lines of key construction.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">Take-away</h2>\n    <p>I dunno. I thought the quality of the code was fine, wouldn’t have decomposed the functions in the same way but wouldn’t have\n    objected on review. I was pleased with the algorithm, but then I would be since it was the same one I’d written, and, having\n    said that, quite possibly that’s the only algorithm that anyone has used. It will be <em>super</em> interesting if someone\n    responds to this write-up saying “You and Claude are fools, here’s a much better way.”</p>\n    <p>Was it worth fifteen minutes of my time to ask Claude and get a slightly better key computation?\n    Only if this ever turns out\n    to be a hot code path and I don’t think anybody’s smart enough to know that in advance.</p>\n    <p>Would I have saved time by asking Claude first? Tough to tell; Quamina’s data structures are a bit non-obvious and I would\n    have had to go to a lot of prompting work to get it to emit code I could use directly.\n    Also, since Quamina is low-level performance-critical infrastructure code, I’d be nervous about having any volume of code\n    that I didn’t really <em>really</em> understand.</p>\n    <p>I guess my take-away was that in this case, Claude knew the Go idioms and APIs better than I did; I’d never looked at the\n    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/unsafe">unsafe</a> package.</p>\n    <p>Which reinforces my\n    suspicion that genAI is going to be especially useful at helping generate code to talk to big complicated\n    APIs that are hard to remember all of.  Here’s an example: Any moderately competent Android developer could add a feature to an\n    app where it strobes the flash and surges the vibration in sync with how fast you’re shaking the device back and forth,\n    probably in an afternoon. But it would require a couple of dozen calls into the dense forest of Android APIs, and I suspect a\n    genAI might get you there a lot faster by just filling the calls in as prompted.</p>\n    <p>Reminder: This is just anecdata.</p>'}]}

How long has it been since an app you use has added a feature that\n    was genuinely excellent and let you do stuff you couldn’t before and didn’t get in your way and created no suspicion that it was\n    strip-mining your life for profit?  I’m here to tell you that this can still happen, and it’s a crushing criticism\n    of my profession that it so rarely does.</p>\n    <p>I’m talking about\n    <a href="https://www.qobuz.com/ca-en/connect">Qobuz Connect</a>. I believe there are other music apps that can do this sort of\n    stuff, but it feels like magic to me.</p>\n    <p>It’s like this. I listen to music at home on an audiophile system with big speakers, in\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/The%20World/Jaguar%20Diary/">our car</a>, and on\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/08/06/Jeanneau-795">our boat</a>.  The only app I touch is the\n    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qobuz.music">Qobuz Android app</a>. The only time it’s actually\n    receiving and playing the music itself is in the car, with the help of Android Auto.  In the other scenarios it’s talking to\n    Qobuz running on a Mac, which actually fetches the music and routes it to the audio system.\n    Usually it figures out what player I want it to control automatically, although there’ve been a couple\n    times when I drove away in the car and it got confused about where to send the music. Generally, it works great.</p>\n    <p>The app’s music experience is rich and involving.</p>\n    <img alt="Qobuz Android app screenshot" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/22/Screenshot_20250622-230116.png" />\n    <p>It has New Releases and curated playlists and a personalized stream for\n    me and a competent search function for those times I absolutely must listen to Deep Purple or Hania Rani or\n    whoever.</p>\n    <p>I get a chatty not-too-long email from Qobuz every Friday, plugging a few of the week’s new releases, with sideways and\n    backward looks too. (This week: A Brian Wilson stream.) The app has so much stuff, especially among the themed streams, that I\n    sometimes get lost. But somehow it’s not irritating; what’s on the screen remains musically interesting and you can always hit\n    the app’s Home button.</p>\n    <p>Qobuz has its own musical tastes that guide its curation. They’re not always compatible with\n    mine<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009my tolerance for EDM and mainstream Hip-hop remains low. And I wish they were\n    stronger on Americana. But the intersection is broad enough to provide plenty of enjoyable new-artist experiences. Let me share\n    one with you:\n    <a href="https://kwashibu.bandcamp.com/album/love-warrior-s-anthem">Kwashibu Area Band</a>, from Ghana.</p>\n    <p>Oh, one complaint: Qobuz was eating my Pixel’s battery. So I poked around online and it’s a known problem; you have to use the\n    Android preferences to stop it from running in the background. Huh? What was it doing in the background anyhow?! But it seems to\n    work fine even when it’s not doing it.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">A Mac, you say?</h2>\n    <p>The music you’re listening to is going to be stored on disk, or incoming from a streaming service. Maybe you want to serve\n    some of the stored music out to listen to it in the car or wherever. There are a variety of audio products in the\n    “Streamer” category that do some of these things in various combinations. A lot of them make fanciful claims about the\n    technology inside and are thus expensive, you can easily spend thousands.</p>\n    <p>But any reasonably modern computer can do all these things and more, plus it also can drive a big-screen display, plus it will\n    probably run the software behind whatever next year’s New Audio Hotness is.</p>\n    <p>At this point the harder-core geeks will adopt a superior tone of voice to say “I do all that stuff with FreeBSD and a bunch of\n    open-source packages running on a potato!”</p>\n    <p>More power to ’em. But I recommend a basic Apple Silicon based Mac Mini, M1 is fine, which you can get for like $300 used on\n    eBay. And if you own a lot of music and video you can plug in a 5T USB drive for a few more peanuts. This will run Plex and\n    Qobuz and almost any other imaginable streaming software. Plus you can plug it into your home-theater screen and it has a modern\n    Web browser so you can also play anything from anywhere on the Web.</p>\n    <p>I’ve been doing this for a while but I had one big gripe. When I wanted to stream music from the Mac, I needed to use a\n    keyboard and mouse, so I keep one of each, Bluetooth-flavored, nearby.

South Korea, of course, being the canonical example. But also Japan and Taiwan and Italy and Spain\n    and so on.</p>\n    <p>And, of course, the USA, where the numbers aren’t <em>that</em> much higher:\n    <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/fertility-rate">U.S. Fertility Rate\n    (1950-2025)</a>. Even so, the population still grows (because of immigration), albeit at less than 1% per annum:\n    <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/population-growth-rate">U.S. Population Growth\n    Rate</a>. If the MAGAs get their way and eventually stop all non-white immigration, the US will be in South Korea\n    territory within a generation or two. </p>    \n    <p>A reasonable person might ask why. It’s not really complicated, as you can read here:\n    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/15/opinion/birth-rate-parenting-natalism.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Pk8.OBam.dOi0UpP-8-DV&amp;smid=url-share">A Bold Idea to Raise the Birthrate: Make Parenting Less Torturous</a>.\n    From which I quote: “To date, no government policies have significantly improved their nation’s birthrates for a sustained\n    period.” The essay argues convincingly that it’s down to two problems: Capitalism and sexism. Neither of which offers an easy\n    fix. </p>\n    <p>Speaking of the travails of late capitalism, here’s how bad it’s getting:\n    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/opinion/crisis-working-homeless.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Qk8.jsTO.aUBSAMHw7Op2&amp;smid=url-share">America\n    Is Pushing Its Workers Into Homelessness</a>.</p>\n    <p>For a refreshingly different take on the business world, here’s Avery Pennarun, CEO of Tailscale: \n    <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20250530">The evasive evitability of enshittification</a>. Not sure I buy what he’s saying, but\n    still worth reading.</p>\n    <p>Most people who visit these pages are geeks or geek-adjacent. If you’re one of those, and especially if you enjoy the small\n    but vibrant genre of Comical Tech War Stories, I recommend\n    <a href="https://yeet.cx/blog/lock-free-rust/">Lock-Free Rust: How to Build a Rollercoaster\n    While It’s on Fire</a></p>\n    <p>And here’s write-up on an AWS product which has one of the best explanations I’ve ever read of the different flavors modern\n    databases come in: <a href="https://www.redshift-observatory.ch/white_papers/downloads/introduction_to_the_fundamentals_of_amazon_redshift.html">Introduction to the Fundamentals of Amazon Redshift</a></p>\n    <p>Of course, the geek conversation these days is much taken up with the the impact of genAI as in “vibe coding”. To\n    summarize the conversation: A few people, not obviously fools,  are saying “This stuff seems to help me” and many others, also\n    apparently sensible, are shouting back “You’re lying to yourself, it can’t be helping!”  Here is some of the testimony: \n    Kellan on <a href="https://laughingmeme.org//2025/05/25/vibe-coding-for-teams.html">Vibe\n    coding for teams, thoughts to date</a>, Armin Ronacher on\n    <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/12/agentic-coding/">Agentic Coding Recommendations</a>,\n    Harper on <a href="https://harper.blog/2025/05/08/basic-claude-code/">Basic Claude Code</a>, and \n    Klabnik on \n    <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/a-tale-of-two-claudes/">A tale of two Claudes</a></p>\n    <p>I lean to believing narratives of personal experience, but on the other hand the skeptics make good points. Another\n    random piece of evidence: Because I’m lazy, I tend to resist adopting technologies that have steep learning curves, which genAI\n    currently does. On many occasions, this has worked out well because those technologies have turned out not to pay off very\n    well. Am I a canary in the coal mine?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">*cough*</h2>\n    <p>Since I introduced myself into the narrative, I’ll note that today is my 70th birthday. I am told that this means\n    that my wisdom has now been maximized, so you’re safe in believing whatever you read in this space.  I don’t have anything\n    special to say to commemorate the occasion,\n    so here’s a picture of my neighborhood’s network infrastructure, which outlines the form of a\n    cathedral’s nave.

The ΛCDM-vs-MOND controversy, i.e. “Is there really dark\n    matter or does gravity get weird starting at the outer edges of galaxies?”, offers great entertainment value. And, there is\n    news!</p>\n    <p>First of all, here’s a nice overview on the controversy:\n    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21638v1">Modified Newtonian Dynamics: Observational Successes and Failures</a>.</p>\n    <p>Which points out that the behavior of “wide binary” star systems ought to help resolve the issue, but that people who\n    study it keep coming up with contradictory findings. Here’s the latest, from Korean researchers: Press release\n    <a href="http://www.sejongpr.ac.kr/sejongnewspaperview.do?currentPage=1&amp;searchField=&amp;searchValue=&amp;boardType=3&amp;pkid=73549&amp;utm_source=beehiiv&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=mediamobilize&amp;_bhlid=3e40dce99e536f4015a1dd2c6afd193a465d17ea">New method of measuring gravity with 3D velocities of wide binary stars is developed and confirms modified gravity</a>\n    and peer-reviewed paper:\n    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adce09">Low-acceleration Gravitational Anomaly\n    from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia Data Release 3</a>.\n    Spoiler: They think the gravity gets weird. I have a math degree but cosmology math is generally way over my head. Having said\n    that, I think those South Koreans may be a bit out over their skis; I generally distrust heroic statistical methods. We’ll\n    see.</p>\n    <p>Let’s do politics. It turns out that the barbaric junta which oppresses the people of China does not limit its barbarism\n    to its own geography: \n    <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-targets-dissidents-canada-1.7543745?cmp=rss">Followed, threatened and smeared\n    — attacks by China against its critics in Canada are on the rise</a>.</p>\n    <p>More politics: The MAGAs are always railing against “elites”.

They’re different, in interesting ways. Let’s walk through the\n    second one.</p> \n    <p>The little thumbnail at the top of the popup is what the image looked like when the C2PA was added. Not provided by the other\n    verifier.</p>\n    <p>The paragraph beginning “Displaying credentials…” says that the C2PA manifest was embedded in the JPG as opposed to stored\n    out on the \n    cloud; The cloud works fine, and is perhaps a good idea because the C2PA manifest can be quite large. I’m not clear on what the\n    “watermark” is about.</p>\n    <p>“Issued by Adobe” means that the Chrome extension verified the embedded C2PA against Adobe’s public key and can be\n    confident that yes, this was really signed by them.</p>\n    <p>“<b>Produced by</b> Timothy Bray” is interesting. How can it know? Well, it turns out that it used LinkedIn’s API to verify\n    that I am\n    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timbraysoftwareguy/">timbraysoftwareguy</a> over on LinkedIn. But it goes further; LinkedIn\n    has an integration with\n    <a href="https://www.clearme.com">Clear</a>, the airport-oriented identity provider. To get a Clear account you have to upload\n    government-issued ID, it’s not trivial.</p>\n    <p>So this short sentence expands to (take a deep breath) “The validator extension verified that Adobe said that\n    LinkedIn said that Clear said that the government ID of the person who posted this says that he’s named Timothy Bray.”</p>\n    <p>Note that the first extension’s popup also tells you that Adobe has verified what my LinkedIn and Instagram accounts\n    are. This seems super-useful and I wonder why the other omits it.</p>\n    <p>“<b>App or device used</b>…” is simple enough, but I’m not actually sure how it works; I guess Adobe has embedded a keypair\n    in my Lightroom installation? If I’d taken the picture with a C2PA-equipped camera this is where that history would be\n    displayed.</p>\n    <p>“<b>AI tool used</b> None”. Interesting and useful, since Adobe provides plenty of genAI-powered tools. Of course, this\n    relies on Lightroom telling the truth, but still.</p>\n    <p>The “View More” button doesn’t currently work; it takes you to the interactive\n    <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/verify/">contentcredentials.org/verify</a> page,\n    which seems to fail in retrieving the JPG. If you download the picture then upload it into the verify page (go ahead, it’s\n    free) \n    that seems to work fine. In addition to the info on the popup, the verify page will tell you (nontechically i.e. vaguely) what I\n    did to the picture with Lightroom.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">What’s good about this?</h2>\n    <p>Well, it’s here and it works! There’s all this hype about how cool it will be when the C2PA includes info about what model\n    of camera and lens it used and what the shutter speed was and so on, but eh, who cares really? What matters to me (and \n    should matter to the world) is <em>provenance</em>: Who posted this thing?</p>\n    <p>As I write this, supporters of Israel and Iran are\n    <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-ai-slop-fight-between-iran-and-israel/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter">having an AI Slop\n    Fight</a> with fake war photos and videos.\n    In a C2PA-rich world, you could check; If some clip doesn’t have Content Credentials you should\n    probably be suspicious, and if it does, it matters whether it was uploaded by someone at\n    <a href="https://www.idf.il/en/">IDF.il</a> versus\n    <a href="https://www.bbc.com">BBC.co.uk</a>.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">What’s wrong with this?</h2>\n    <p>Look, I hate to nitpick. I’m overwhelmingly positive on this news, it’s an existence proof that C2PA can be made to work in\n    the wild.\n    My impression is that most of the money and muscle comes from Adobe; good on ’em.\n    But there are things that would make it more useful, and usable by more Web sites. These are not listed in\n    any particular order.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">Identity!</h2>\n    <p>Adobe, it’s nice that you let me establish my identity with LinkedIn, Instagram, and Clear. But what I’d\n    <em>really</em> like is if you could also verify and sign my Fediverse and Bluesky handles. And, Fediverse and ATProto\n    developers, would you please, first of all, stop stripping C2PA manifests from uploaded photo EXIF, and secondly, add your own\n    link to the C2PA chain saying something like “Originally posted by @timbray@cosocial.ca.”</p>\n    <p>Because having verifiable media provenance in the world of social media would be a strong tool against disinformation\n    and slop.</p>\n    <p>Oh, and another note to Adobe: When I export a photo, the embed-manifest also offers me the opportunity, under the heading\n    “Web3”, to allow the image “be used for NFT creative attribution on supported marketplaces” where the supported marketplaces are\n    Phantom and MetaMask. Seriously, folks, in 2025? Please get this scammy cryptoslime out of my face.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Browsers please…</h2>\n    <p>This was done with Chrome extensions. There are people working on extensions for Firefox and\n    Safari, but they’re not here yet. Annoyingly, the extensions also don’t seem to work in mobile Chrome, which is where most\n    people look at most media.</p>\n    <p>I would love it if this were done directly and automatically by the browser.\n    The major browsers aren’t perfect, but their creators are known to take security seriously, and I’d be much happier trusting\n    one of them, rather than an extension from a company I’d never previously heard of.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">… or maybe JavaScript?</h2>\n    <p>The next-best solution would be a nice JS package that just Does The Right\n    Thing. It should work like the way I do fonts: If you look in the source for the page you are now reading, the splodge of JS at\n    the top includes a couple of lines \n    that mention “typekit.com”. Typekit (since acquired by Adobe) offers access to a huge selection of excellent fonts.\n    Those JS invocations result in the text you are now reading being displayed in\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/07/17/Tisa">FF Tisa Web Pro</a>.</p>\n    <p>Which<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009this is important<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009is not free. And to be clear, I am\n    willing to pay to get Content Credentials for the pictures on this blog. It feels exactly like paying a small fee for access to\n    a professionally-managed font library.\n    Operating a Content-Credentials service wouldn’t be free, it’d require running a\n    server and wrangling certs. At scale, though, it should be pretty cheap.</p>\n    <p>So here’s an offer: If someone launches a service that allows me to straightforwardly include the\n    fact that this picture was sourced from tbray.org in my Content Credentials, my wallet is (modestly) open.</p>\n    <p>By the way, the core JavaScript code is already under construction; here’s \n    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/c2pa-extension-validator">Microsoft</a> and the\n    <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/introduction">Content Authority Initiative</a> itself.\n    There’s also a Rust crate for server-side use, and a “c2patool” command-line utility based on it..</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Open-Source issues</h2>\n    <p>You’ll notice that the right-click-for-Content-Credentials doesn’t work on the smaller version of the picture embedded in the\n    text you are now reading; just the larger one.  This is because the decades-old Perl-based <span class="o">ongoing</span>\n    publishing software runs the main-page pictures through\n    <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a>, which doesn’t do C2PA. I should find a way to route around this.</p>\n    <p>In fact, it wouldn’t be rocket science for ImageMagick (or open-source packages generally) to write C2PA manifests and insert\n    them in the media files they create.  But how should they sign them? As noted, that requires a server that provides cert-based\n    signatures, something that nobody would expect from even well-maintained open-source packages.</p>\n    <p>I dunno, maybe someone should provide a managed-ImageMagick service that (for a small fee) offers signed-C2PA-manifest\n    embedding?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-9">What’s next?</h2>\n    <p>The work that needs to be done is nontrivial but, frankly, not that taxing. And the rewards would be high.\n    Because it feels like a no-brainer that knowing who posted something is a big deal. Also the inverse: Knowing that you\n    <em>don’t</em> know who posted it.</p>\n    <p>Where is it an especially big deal? On social media, obviously. It’s really time for those guys to start climbing on board.</p>'}]}

But first…</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">The rent is too damn high</h2>\n    <p>I promise I’ll talk about genAI applications but let’s start with money. <em>Lots</em> of money, big numbers! For example,\n    venture-cap startup money pouring into AI, which as of now apparently adds up to\n    <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-nvidia-played-a-central-role-in-the-306-billion-ai-startup-boom-195741749.html">$306\n    billion</a>. And that’s just startups; Among the giants, Google alone\n    <a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/google-cloud-generative-ai-data-center-capacity-buildouts/739357/">apparently plans\n    $75B</a> in capital expenditure on AI\n    infrastructure, and they represent maybe a quarter at most of cloud capex. You think those are big numbers? McKinsey offers\n    <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-dollar-race-to-scale-data-centers">The cost of compute: A $7 trillion race to scale data centers</a>.</p>\n    <p>Obviously, lots of people are\n    wondering when and where the revenue will be to pay for it all. There’s one thing we know for sure:\n    The pro-genAI voices are fueled by hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fear and desire; fear that it’ll\n    never pay off and desire for a piece of the money. Can you begin to imagine the pressure for revenue that investors and\n    executives and middle managers are under?</p>\n    <p><a href="https://cosocial.ca/@timbray/114572118905328515">Here’s an example</a> of the kind of debate that ensues.</p>\n    <img alt="Anil Dash on Mastodon, on MCP vs the Fediverse" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/Anil-MCP.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>“MCP” is\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol">Model Context Protocol</a>, used for communicating between LLM\n    software and other systems and services.<br />I have no opinion as to its quality or utility.</p></div>\n    <p>I suggest that when you’re getting a pitch for genAI technology, you should have that greed and\n    fear in the back of your mind. Or maybe at the front.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">And that’s just the money</h2>\n    <p>For some reason, I don’t hear much any more about the environmental cost of genAI, the gigatons of carbon pouring out of the\n    system, imperilling my children’s future. Let’s please not ignore that; let’s read things like\n    <a href="https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-center-energy-needs-are-upending-power-grids-and-threatening-the-climate">Data\n    Center Energy Needs Could Upend Power Grids and Threaten the Climate</a> and let’s make sure every freaking conversation about\n    genAI acknowledges this grievous cost.</p>\n    <p>Now let’s look at a few sectors where genAI is said to be a big deal: Coding, teaching, and professional\n    communication. To keep things balanced, I’ll start in a space where I have kind things to say.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Coding</h2>\n    <p>Wow, is my tribe ever melting down. The pro- and anti-genAI factions are hurling polemical thunderbolts at each\n    other, and I mean extra hot and pointy ones. For example, here are 5600 words entitled\n    <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2025/06/i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now.html">I Think I’m Done Thinking About genAI\n    For Now</a>. Well-written words, too.</p>\n    <p>But, while I have a lot of sympathy for the contras and am sickened by some of the promoters, at the moment\n    I’m mostly in tune with Thomas Ptacek’s\n    <a href="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/">My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts</a>. It’s long and (fortunately) well-written\n    and I (mostly) find it hard to disagree with.</p>\n    <p>it’s as simple as this: I keep hearing talented programmers\n    whose integrity I trust tell me “Yeah, LLMs are helping me get shit done.” The probability that they’re all lying or being\n    fooled seems very low.</p>\n    <p>Just to be clear, I note an absence of concern for cost and carbon in these conversations. Which is unacceptable. But let’s\n    move on.</p>\n    <p>It’s worth noting that I learned two useful things from Ptacek’s essay that I hadn’t really understood. First, the “agentic”\n    architecture of programming tools: You ask the agent to create code and it asks the LLM, which will sometimes \n    hallucinate; the agent will observe that it doesn’t compile or makes all the unit tests fail, discards it, and re-prompts. If\n    it takes the agent module 25 prompts to generate code that while imperfect is at least correct, who cares?</p>\n    <p>Second lesson, and to be fair this is just anecdata: It feels like the Go programming language is especially well-suited to\n    LLM-driven automation. It’s small, has a large standard library, and a culture that has strong shared idioms for doing almost\n    anything. Anyhow, we’ll find out if this early impression stands up to longer and wider industry experience.</p>\n    <p>Turning our attention back to cost, let’s assume that eventually all or most developers become somewhat LLM-assisted. Are\n    there enough of them, and will they pay enough, to cover all that investment?  Especially given that models that are both\n    open-source and excellent are certain to proliferate? Seems dubious.</p>\n    <p>Suppose that, as Ptacek suggests, LLMs/agents allow us to automate the tedious low-intellectual-effort parts of our\n    job. Should we be concerned about how junior developers learn to get past that “easy stuff” and on the way to senior skills?\n    That seems a very good question, so…</p>\n    <h2 id="p-10">Learning</h2>\n    <p>Quite likely you’ve already seen Jason Koebler’s\n    <a href="https://www.404media.co/teachers-are-not-ok-ai-chatgpt/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter">Teachers Are Not OK</a>, a\n    frankly horrifying survey of genAI’s impact on secondary and tertiary education. It is a tale of unrelieved grief and pain\n    and wreckage. Since genAI isn’t going to go away and students aren’t going to stop being lazy, \n    it seems like we’re going to re-invent the way people teach and learn.</p>\n    <p>The stories of students furiously deploying genAI to avoid the effort of actually, you know,\n    learning, are sad. Even sadder  are those of genAI-crazed administrators leaning on faculty to become more efficient and\n    “businesslike” by using it.</p> \n    <p>I really don’t think there’s a coherent pro-genAI case to be made in the education context.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-11">Professional communication</h2>\n    <p>If you want to use LLMs to automate communication with your family or friends or lovers, there’s nothing I can say that will\n    help you. So let’s restrict this to conversation and reporting around work and private projects and voluntarism and so on.</p>\n    <p>I’m\n    pretty sure this is where the people who think they’re going to make big money with AI think it’s going to come from.\n    If you’re interested in that thinking,\n    <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Der8WWGeVxdOWx37bMV_nj9N1tUAVcvSSRa6qxKx75g/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1">here’s\n    a sample</a>; a slide deck by a Keith Riegert for the book-publishing business which, granted, is a bit stagnant and a whole lot\n    overconcentrated these days. I suspect scrolling through it will produce a strong emotional reaction for quite a few readers here.\n    It’s also useful in that it talks specifically about costs.</p>\n    <p>That is for corporate-branded output. What about personal or internal professional communication; by which I mean emails and\n    sales reports and committee drafts and project pitches and so on? I’m pretty negative about this. If your email or pitch\n    doc or whatever needs to be summarized, or if it has the colorless affectless error-prone polish of 2025’s LLMs, I would\n    probably discard it unread.\n    I already found the switch to turn off Gmail’s attempts to summarize my emails.</p>\n    <p>What’s the genAI world’s equivalent of “Tl;dr”? I’m thinking “TA;dr” (A for AI)\n    or “Tg;dr” (g for genAI) or just “LLM:dr”.</p>\n    <p>And this vision of everyone using genAI to amplify their output and everyone else using it to summarize and filter\n    their input feels simply perverse.</p>\n    <p>Here’s what I think is \n    <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@codinghorror/114606355212363074">an important finding</a>, ably summarized by Jeff Atwood:</p> \n    <img alt="Dare Obasanjo and Jeff Atwood on how to survive AI" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/Dare-Jeff.png" />\n    <p>Seriously, since LLMs by design emit streams that are optimized for plausibility and for harmony with the model’s\n    training base, in an AI-centric world there’s a powerful incentive to say things that are implausible, that are out of tune,\n    that are, bluntly, weird. So there’s one upside.</p>\n    <p>And let’s go back to cost. Are the prices in Riegert’s slide deck going to pay for trillions in capex?\n    Another example: My family has a Google workplace account, and the price just went up from $6/user/month to\n    $7. The announcement from Google emphasized that this was related to the added value provided by Gemini. Is $1/user/month gonna\n    make this tech make business sense?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-13">What I can and can’t buy</h2>\n    <p>I can sorta buy the premise that there are genAI productivity boosts to be had in the code space and maybe some other\n    specialized domains.  I can’t buy for a second that genAI is anything but toxic for anything education-related.  On the\n    business-communications side, it’s damn well gonna be tried because billions of dollars and many management careers depend on\n    it paying off. We’ll see but I’m skeptical.</p>\n    <p>On the money side? I don’t see how the math and the capex work. And all the time, I think about the carbon that’s poisoning\n    the planet my children have to live on.</p>\n    <p>I think that the best we can hope for is the eventual financial meltdown leaving a few useful islands of things that\n    are actually useful at prices that make sense.</p>\n    <p>And in a decade or so, I can see business-section stories about all the big data center shells that were never filled in,\n    standing there empty, looking for another use. It’s gonna be tough, what can you do with buildings that have no windows?</p>'}]}

What the significance of the image might be I have no idea. It looks like Ice vs Fire but how that has anything to do with creating content beats me. I guess it might be a metaphor but if so I can\'t imagine how it would be a complimentary one. When fire and ice meet, all you get is a lot of steam.</p><p>The forum post itself contains a daunting amount of detail about the new program. A lot of it seemed slightly odd to me and some of it I felt almost verged on the passive-aggressive, as if whoever wrote it was anticipating people trying to blag their way onto the program without having the necessary bona fides. Then again, gamers, so...</p><p>The elevator pitch is that the program offers "<i>an official initiative by Daybreak Games to support and empower creators who bring the world of EQII to life.</i>" but when you read the whole thing it seems more like an attempt to spin up some social media presence, something the game is currently lacking, by handing out bribes.&nbsp;</p><p>Not a bad idea at all. What surprised me were the requirements for inclusion in the program, which seem <i>very </i>stringent, especially for a twenty year-old MMORPG with a relatively small player-base, and most especially in view of the way that player-base skews towards the upper end of the age scale, at least for online gaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, Angeliana is uncompromising in her determination to professionalize the enterprise. The whole things begins with this statement of intent:</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>"This is the first official round of the Creator Program. Spots are \nlimited, and while many applicants may meet the base requirements, \nacceptance is not guaranteed. We’re prioritizing active, engaged \ncreators who align with the goals of the program and can help us shape \nthe future of the EQII community."</b></span></blockquote><p></p><p>My first thought was to wonder if there would be enough interest to fill the available spots at all. The idea that there will be such a rush to join that spots need to be limited seems a little fanciful.&nbsp;How many EQII players even use social media, much less create it, I wonder? Is there really going to be <i>that </i>much competition for places?</p><p>Further down the announcement there are some quite specific entry requirements:</p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">"<i>Who can apply?</i><br /></span></b>\n</p><ul><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Creators aged 18+</span></b></li><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Content makers generating at least 15 pieces \nof content in the last 90 days across at least three categories \n(Streaming, Writing, Long-form Video, Short-form Video, Podcasting, \nSocial Reach)</span></b></li><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Must be in good standing in the <i>EverQuest II</i> community"</span></b></li></ul><p>Over 18s only is standard, of course, and being in "<i>good standing</i>" (I.e. not currently banned or suspended from the game.) makes perfect sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don\'t have an issue with any of that.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s the "<i>15 pieces of content in the last 90 days across at least three categories</i>" part that I find hard to rationalize. I mean, even as an either/or, it seems like a big barrier to entry but both?</p><p>And while it\'s very nice to see blogs included among social media. (It says "<i>writing</i>" in the above quote but elsewhere blogs are specifically mentioned.), who is out there writing blog posts, making videos&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>podcasting about <i>EQII </i>more than once a week? Anyone?

Big whoop.</p><p>Personally, I\'d rather pay for my own expansions and All Access membership and get to see everything at the same time as everyone else. I never use the beta access for Game Updates or expansions because it spoils the fun when the real thing arrives and as for getting the expansions and membership for free, I always feel that if someone\'s giving me stuff like that, even if they make it plain there are no strings, there are <i>ALWAYS </i>strings.</p><p>At the very least it makes me feel uncomfortable if I want to say something negative.

What the significance of the image might be I have no idea. It looks like Ice vs Fire but how that has anything to do with creating content beats me. I guess it might be a metaphor but if so I can\'t imagine how it would be a complimentary one. When fire and ice meet, all you get is a lot of steam.</p><p>The forum post itself contains a daunting amount of detail about the new program. A lot of it seemed slightly odd to me and some of it I felt almost verged on the passive-aggressive, as if whoever wrote it was anticipating people trying to blag their way onto the program without having the necessary bona fides. Then again, gamers, so...</p><p>The elevator pitch is that the program offers "<i>an official initiative by Daybreak Games to support and empower creators who bring the world of EQII to life.</i>" but when you read the whole thing it seems more like an attempt to spin up some social media presence, something the game is currently lacking, by handing out bribes.&nbsp;</p><p>Not a bad idea at all. What surprised me were the requirements for inclusion in the program, which seem <i>very </i>stringent, especially for a twenty year-old MMORPG with a relatively small player-base, and most especially in view of the way that player-base skews towards the upper end of the age scale, at least for online gaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, Angeliana is uncompromising in her determination to professionalize the enterprise. The whole things begins with this statement of intent:</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>"This is the first official round of the Creator Program. Spots are \nlimited, and while many applicants may meet the base requirements, \nacceptance is not guaranteed. We’re prioritizing active, engaged \ncreators who align with the goals of the program and can help us shape \nthe future of the EQII community."</b></span></blockquote><p></p><p>My first thought was to wonder if there would be enough interest to fill the available spots at all. The idea that there will be such a rush to join that spots need to be limited seems a little fanciful.&nbsp;How many EQII players even use social media, much less create it, I wonder? Is there really going to be <i>that </i>much competition for places?</p><p>Further down the announcement there are some quite specific entry requirements:</p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">"<i>Who can apply?</i><br /></span></b>\n</p><ul><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Creators aged 18+</span></b></li><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Content makers generating at least 15 pieces \nof content in the last 90 days across at least three categories \n(Streaming, Writing, Long-form Video, Short-form Video, Podcasting, \nSocial Reach)</span></b></li><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Must be in good standing in the <i>EverQuest II</i> community"</span></b></li></ul><p>Over 18s only is standard, of course, and being in "<i>good standing</i>" (I.e. not currently banned or suspended from the game.) makes perfect sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don\'t have an issue with any of that.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s the "<i>15 pieces of content in the last 90 days across at least three categories</i>" part that I find hard to rationalize. I mean, even as an either/or, it seems like a big barrier to entry but both?</p><p>And while it\'s very nice to see blogs included among social media. (It says "<i>writing</i>" in the above quote but elsewhere blogs are specifically mentioned.), who is out there writing blog posts, making videos&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>podcasting about <i>EQII </i>more than once a week? Anyone?

Not <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/wednesdays-child.html">the one</a></span> about <i>Wednesday </i>the show. The one I put up two days ago. The one that none of you have read.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, you <i>did </i>read it, did you? Congratulations! That puts you in quite the elite club. Want to know how to get into the club\'s super-secret, cool kids only treehouse? Click on the embedded <a href="https://youtu.be/_X1ONG28LBs"><span style="color: #04ff00;">video </span></a>in that post. If you\'re quick you could be the fifth person ever to see it!</p><p>I expect people not to watch the videos. Hardly anyone ever does. I can see how many times they\'ve been viewed on <i>YouTube </i>(And yes, I checked, and watching it on the blog does increment the YouTube counter.). The last one I did before this, for the post <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/some-puppy-walking.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Some Puppy Walking</span></a>,&nbsp; has been watched sixteen times. The post itself has over three hundred views so you do the math...</p><p>Three hundred views used to be bang on average for a post here, after it\'s been up for a week or more. So far, only forty-five people have viewed Wednesday\'s post, according to the little widget next to it in the post list in <i>Blogger</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s about the only stat I ever pay any attention to these days. I got very fed up with the unnecessary complexity of <i>Google Analytics</i>, so when they revamped it and you had to jump through a load of technical hoops to have your website included in the new version, I opted not to bother.</p><p>I also stopped looking at Blogger\'s own stats ages ago because they don\'t seem to filter out bots so they\'re always ludicrously inflated. Even the page-view number that I do still look at, mostly because it\'s always right there in front of me, is just the same number from the main stats, so I don\'t take it too seriously either.</p><p>Still, even bad stats are useful if they\'re consistent in their badness. Any sudden change means something must have happened. And there has been one heck of a big change just recently.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/s992/postcount1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="303" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/w400-h303/postcount1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Before Blaugust, that page view figure bobbled fairly consistently somewhere between 250 and 400 over the first seven days or so after the post published. Most posts stop picking up views after that although there can obviously be spikes at any time.<p></p><p>At this point, you\'re probably expecting me to say page views went up during Blaugust. That\'s always been the conventional wisdom and with this year having a record number of participants <i>and </i>with me consistently linking every post in the Blaugust Discord, it\'s more than reasonable to imagine it would hold true.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn\'t, though, or not for me. Most years I see little or no uptick in views from Blaugust and this year was much the same. Until the last week, that is.&nbsp;</p><p>From the 25th of August, page views almost doubled, averaging around seven or eight hundred. That bump carried on long after Blaugust ended and indeed became more pronounced as September went on, with quite a few posts hitting four figures, topping out at just over two thousand.</p><p>Why? No idea. I rarely have any clue why these things happen. And equally, I have no explanation for why they stop, which seems to be what\'s happened now. Only this time the drop is as spectacular as the rise was.</p><p>Generally, any post I put up gets most of its views in the first 24-48 hours, as you\'d expect. I haven\'t been keeping track but I\'m fairly sure back when they were finishing up with&nbsp; three or four hundred views, they\'d have seen half of those in the first two or three days.</p><p>The last two posts have so far managed 45 views in two days and 34 in 24 hours respectively. That doesn\'t seem normal to me, which is why this morning I started fiddling about in Google\'s stat cupboards to see if I could figure out what was going on.</p><p>I\'ll put you out of your suspense now.

If you have a Blogger blog, I\'d recommend giving it a look. It\'s much clearer, far&nbsp;easier to understand, and best of all it explains what the stats mean. You can set filters and use them to dig out some quite useful detail without a great deal of trouble.<p></p><p>I particularly liked the new <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/16308503"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Insights Report</span></a>, which gives you a very clear indication of which of your posts are trending up or down and enough granularity to take a shot at figuring out why. And that\'s where I noticed something very odd.</p><p>It wasn\'t that there\'d been a big spike in search requests for my post on housing in <i>Throne and Liberty</i>, which I put up just under a year ago. <i>T&amp;L</i> has just added housing so obviously people are googling for information on it, none of which they\'re going to find here.</p><p>It\'s harder to explain why there\'s been a surge of interest in <i>Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt</i>. If anything new is happening there, I\'ve missed it. Two of my posts about it do turn up on the first page of Google Search results though, so I guess if anyone is still interested, they might well give me a look.</p><p>The one that really set me thinking, though, was the sudden interest in&nbsp;<a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/09/stardust-memories-and-other-short.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">this post</span></a> from just over a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s a "<i>What I\'ve Been Listening To Lately</i>" post. No-one reads those. Okay, some people do, but clearly that series isn\'t going to come up in a general search very often. Yes, they do often have the names of famous people in the body of the post but hardly ever in the title and let\'s be realistic here - even putting <i>Taylor Swift</i>\'s name in the title of your blog post is not going to get you onto the first hundred pages on a search result, is it? I mean, there\'s a lot of competition there...</p><p>In the case of this particular post, I didn\'t mention Taylor Swift in the title (Although <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5URefVYaJrA"><span style="color: #04ff00;">A$AP Rocky\'s Taylor Swif </span></a></i>is one the featured tunes.) or anyone even close to being that famous. I did, as it happens, mention the name of a <i>Woody Allen </i>movie that doesn\'t even feature in the post at all, but that\'s not what people were searching for.</p><p>They were looking for a band called <i>X-Cetra,</i> a bunch of Californian tweenage girls who made a very odd album by the name of <i>Stardust </i>a couple of decades ago. I said in the post that X-Cetra didn\'t even have a Wikipedia page. I just checked and they still don\'t. I guess that explains why someone would bother to click through to a blog that mentioned them.</p><p>And they have. Not in the kind of numbers that click through to check on posts about clothes or housing in <i>Once Human</i>, which seem to be by far the biggest draw here over the last twelve months, but in numbers that feel statistically significant, especially since most of them appear to have happened not when I put the post up last year but in this last month.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/s1180/x-cetra%202.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="368" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/w640-h368/x-cetra%202.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>In fact, my top search query for September is "<i>X-cetra stardust</i>" and two more variations of the phrase are also in the top ten.

It may not sound like a great conversion rate but in comparison, of more than a thousand inquiries about housing in Throne &amp; Liberty, only nine people clicked.</p><p>What\'s even more interesting is that, of the 39 clicks from search the post has ever received, 38 of them were in the last month.

Yes, I know it\'s not Blaugust any more but always remember, a blog is not just for August.<p></p><p>It all started when I replied to <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/so-very-real.html?showComment=1759416282357#c3716573886534372536"><i>Tipa</i>\'s comment</a></span> on <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/so-very-real.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Wednesday\'s post</span></a>. Not <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/wednesdays-child.html">the one</a></span> about <i>Wednesday </i>the show. The one I put up two days ago. The one that none of you have read.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, you <i>did </i>read it, did you? Congratulations! That puts you in quite the elite club. Want to know how to get into the club\'s super-secret, cool kids only treehouse? Click on the embedded <a href="https://youtu.be/_X1ONG28LBs"><span style="color: #04ff00;">video </span></a>in that post. If you\'re quick you could be the fifth person ever to see it!</p><p>I expect people not to watch the videos. Hardly anyone ever does. I can see how many times they\'ve been viewed on <i>YouTube </i>(And yes, I checked, and watching it on the blog does increment the YouTube counter.). The last one I did before this, for the post <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/some-puppy-walking.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Some Puppy Walking</span></a>,&nbsp; has been watched sixteen times. The post itself has over three hundred views so you do the math...</p><p>Three hundred views used to be bang on average for a post here, after it\'s been up for a week or more. So far, only forty-five people have viewed Wednesday\'s post, according to the little widget next to it in the post list in <i>Blogger</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s about the only stat I ever pay any attention to these days. I got very fed up with the unnecessary complexity of <i>Google Analytics</i>, so when they revamped it and you had to jump through a load of technical hoops to have your website included in the new version, I opted not to bother.</p><p>I also stopped looking at Blogger\'s own stats ages ago because they don\'t seem to filter out bots so they\'re always ludicrously inflated. Even the page-view number that I do still look at, mostly because it\'s always right there in front of me, is just the same number from the main stats, so I don\'t take it too seriously either.</p><p>Still, even bad stats are useful if they\'re consistent in their badness. Any sudden change means something must have happened. And there has been one heck of a big change just recently.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/s992/postcount1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="303" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/w400-h303/postcount1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Before Blaugust, that page view figure bobbled fairly consistently somewhere between 250 and 400 over the first seven days or so after the post published. Most posts stop picking up views after that although there can obviously be spikes at any time.<p></p><p>At this point, you\'re probably expecting me to say page views went up during Blaugust. That\'s always been the conventional wisdom and with this year having a record number of participants <i>and </i>with me consistently linking every post in the Blaugust Discord, it\'s more than reasonable to imagine it would hold true.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn\'t, though, or not for me. Most years I see little or no uptick in views from Blaugust and this year was much the same. Until the last week, that is.&nbsp;</p><p>From the 25th of August, page views almost doubled, averaging around seven or eight hundred. That bump carried on long after Blaugust ended and indeed became more pronounced as September went on, with quite a few posts hitting four figures, topping out at just over two thousand.</p><p>Why? No idea. I rarely have any clue why these things happen. And equally, I have no explanation for why they stop, which seems to be what\'s happened now. Only this time the drop is as spectacular as the rise was.</p><p>Generally, any post I put up gets most of its views in the first 24-48 hours, as you\'d expect. I haven\'t been keeping track but I\'m fairly sure back when they were finishing up with&nbsp; three or four hundred views, they\'d have seen half of those in the first two or three days.</p><p>The last two posts have so far managed 45 views in two days and 34 in 24 hours respectively. That doesn\'t seem normal to me, which is why this morning I started fiddling about in Google\'s stat cupboards to see if I could figure out what was going on.</p><p>I\'ll put you out of your suspense now. I did not figure out what was going on. I have no way of knowing whether regular readers have suddenly found better things to do or if Google has started tallying things differently. I\'ll just wait for it to change again, which it will.</p><p>I did, however, discover some other new and quite interesting things while I was rummaging and that\'s how this post came about.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/s1033/insights1.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="316" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/w400-h316/insights1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Firstly, I\'ll say that <i><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Google Search Console</span></a></i> is a huge improvement on Analytics for the casual user.

I realy like New World. It\'s my second most-played game on Steam, after <i>Valheim</i>. There\'s <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/season-10-nighthaven-announcement"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a major update</span></a> - you could almost call it an expansion - coming to the game in less than two weeks and it looks very interesting, all vampires and werewolves and spooky castles. Just right for the season</p><p>It\'s a free update but you have to have <i>New World Aeternum</i> to get it and I don\'t. So I\'d have to buy that, which would then give me even more new-to-me content. And contrary to what you might expect, that\'s actually a point against going back. I don\'t have the time or inclination to take on a big tranche of content in any game right now. I\'m looking for something to fill the odd session, here and there, not some big commitment that could take weeks.</p><p>Something like, oh, I don\'t know, a new solo dungeon or an instance I haven\'t done. Even better, one that might have some drops I could use. I\'ve always been a big advocate of the gameplay being its own reward but good drops are cake.</p><p>All of that led me back to <i>EQII</i>, where there have been two Game Updates this year that I haven\'t touched.&nbsp;</p><p>Alright, that\'s not entirely true. I did set foot in the new, contested dungeon that came in GU128 back in April. It didn\'t go well.</p><p>That update is called <i>Lure of Darkness</i> and features a large dungeon by the name of <i>Spiral of Vul</i>. It\'s designed for multiple groups to explore at the same time, old-school style, but it does have a small, soloable area at the front, as has been the norm in EQII as far back as beta.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/s1920/eq2totf3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/w640-h360/eq2totf3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I can say from experience that the allocated area for solo players <i>is </i>soloable. I did a little bit of it back in April and I didn\'t die. I also didn\'t have much fun. The mobs were very tough and took ages to kill. If there are any soloable bosses, I never got far enough to try my luck with them. I did one quest, whch took about half an hour and gave up.</p><p>That was on my Berserker. Since then, I\'ve upgraded all his gear using the Anniversary gift. He was mostly in 475-495 Resolve gear then and now he\'s wearing all 525. Resolve is a very sound indicator of performance, much like Gear Score in other games, and 30-50 points is enough to make a difference so I was hopeful I might get a little further this time.</p><p>I did not. I map-hopped over to the <i>Sodden Archipelago</i> and flew halfway across the zone to the entrance of the dungeon, went inside and immediately picked up a couple of shinies that completed a collection. That made the trip worthwhile, which was just as well because the trash mobs seemed no easier to kill than before. I tried a couple, decided it wasn\'t going to be any more fun than last time, so I&nbsp; left.</p><p>The second of the annual updates arrived in August. It\'s called<i> Fear of Eternity</i> and consists of Fabled versions of the dungeons from the 2012 expansion, <i>Chains of Eternity</i>. Fabled dungeons are generally the same as the originals but with all the mobs revamped for the current level cap and all the loot similarly upgraded. They also come in all the regular flavors - Solo, Heroic I and Heroic II.</p><p>My experience with Fabled dungeons at the time they first appear has been patchy. There have been some I\'ve been able to make progress in but mostly they\'re too tough for me. I usually give them a go, decide it\'s too much like hard work and leave them for later. Sometimes I do come back and finish them when I\'m a bit tougher, sometimes I forget they exist.</p><p>I was fully expecting the first one I tried, <i>Fabled Temple of the Faceless</i>, to be at least as hard as Spiral of Vul. I mean, you\'d think so, woudn\'t you? It\'s six months later, after all. What would be the point of adding something easier to the game at level cap?</p><p>It <i>was </i>easier. It was a lot easier. At least it was once I got myself sorted out.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/s639/eq2tofs2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/w400-h388/eq2tofs2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>The zone-in is much more conveniently placed, right on the dock where you zone in to Sodden Archipelago. No flying right across the map this time. That was nice. You can access all the available dungeons from the update from the same portal, too. Also nice.<p></p><p>I picked the first instance on the list, zoned in and pulled a mob to test the waters. They were warm. The mob, a three-up arrow spider, theoretically tough for trash, died in a reasonable time and didn\'t pose much of&nbsp; threat. I worked my across the opening area towards the first boss, killing as I went and it felt comfortable. It wasn\'t a walkover but it wasn\'t a grind. I felt like I was moving through the zone at a reasonable pace.</p><p>I got in range of the boss and thought about looking him up for strats but I couldn\'t be bothered so I just pulled him to see what would happen. Nothing much. In fact, as far as he was concerned, nothing at all. His health stayed solidly at 100% no matter how hard and how often I hit him. Clearly there were unseen factors in play.</p><p>With my merc pumping out the healing and the Berserker having a pretty solid self-healing capacity of his own it was a stalemate, albeit one that was eventually only going to end one way, even if it was likely to take an hour to get there. I rummaged in my bags for a <i>Totem of Escape</i> to port myself to the zone entrance and couldn\'t find one so I just legged it to the zone-line with the boss beating on me all the way. He still didn\'t make much of a dent, even with my back turned.</p><p>Once I was safe outside, I looked at the wiki. It turns out there are two pillars, one in each of two side-temples, that have to be destroyed before the first boss can be damaged. I vaguely remembered that from whenever I did the dungeon when I was questing through the relevant expansion but that was years ago and I needed to be reminded.</p><p>I went back in, found the pillars, knocked them down, then had a second go at the boss. It went much better that time.&nbsp;</p><p>I was curious to see what he\'d drop. I was hoping it would be gear over 500 Resolve. In fact it was identical in quality to the Anniversary freebies - 525 Resolve. Since I was already fully kitted out in that, I was also hoping it wouldn\'t be Plate Armor. I could give that to my Inquisitor but she\'s not Level 130 yet so she\'d have to do five more levels before she could wear it.</p><p>I was hoping for cloth so my Necro could have it and cloth was what I got. On the first boss, anyway.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/s1249/eq2totf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/w640-h302/eq2totf1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>It had been fun and profitable so far so I carried on. Temple of The Faceless is a fairly compact, to the point dungeon, without a lot of wandering about required. Exactly what I was looking for. I progressed through the next two bosses, checking strats just in case of any more surprises but having very little trouble with either.</p><p>That took me up to bedtime so I camped where I was and picked up again where I left off the next morning. There was only one more boss left but it was a dragon and they can be tricky. In the event, though, he went down as easily as the rest.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn\'t get any more cloth armor but my Bruiser is going to be happy. The rest was all leather. The two sessions were fun, the difficulty just about right for me, requiring a certain amount of attention and concentration but not so much I couldn\'t take a few screenshots during the fights.</p><p>There are several more Fabled instances in the update so I\'ll most likely take a look at those next. The deciding factor on whether I do or not will be how much fun I\'m having. The upgraded loot is nice but I\'m all too aware it will be made obsolete by the free handouts at the start of the coming expansion, let alone the quest rewards from the storyline.</p><p>Not to mention there\'s the stuff the pandas are handing out. Which reminds me. As of this week\'s reset, I must have a new panda quest to do...</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBJOyn_Pz0YPxTzbK92J9KR38Y5hmxD8PRKjE6FYzafmUwlwzS-v3HN5uXn_Qi8w04K648eADQE7zrryeMz6DHr5NZr-vOXdMydJ_Lb3EAwPKu-DaxVoPxOqINCDTwQi4y3Ft19Hnw6t7HOeS_qNBRYXyoHaQ27rJDAWR_J8OpHmq3BU7X2T3NN3BC-Us/s1418/eq2templered1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="362" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBJOyn_Pz0YPxTzbK92J9KR38Y5hmxD8PRKjE6FYzafmUwlwzS-v3HN5uXn_Qi8w04K648eADQE7zrryeMz6DHr5NZr-vOXdMydJ_Lb3EAwPKu-DaxVoPxOqINCDTwQi4y3Ft19Hnw6t7HOeS_qNBRYXyoHaQ27rJDAWR_J8OpHmq3BU7X2T3NN3BC-Us/w640-h362/eq2templered1.jpg" width="640" /></a>Yesterday evening and again this morning, I did something unusual.

Since then, I\'ve upgraded all his gear using the Anniversary gift. He was mostly in 475-495 Resolve gear then and now he\'s wearing all 525. Resolve is a very sound indicator of performance, much like Gear Score in other games, and 30-50 points is enough to make a difference so I was hopeful I might get a little further this time.</p><p>I did not. I map-hopped over to the <i>Sodden Archipelago</i> and flew halfway across the zone to the entrance of the dungeon, went inside and immediately picked up a couple of shinies that completed a collection. That made the trip worthwhile, which was just as well because the trash mobs seemed no easier to kill than before. I tried a couple, decided it wasn\'t going to be any more fun than last time, so I&nbsp; left.</p><p>The second of the annual updates arrived in August. It\'s called<i> Fear of Eternity</i> and consists of Fabled versions of the dungeons from the 2012 expansion, <i>Chains of Eternity</i>. Fabled dungeons are generally the same as the originals but with all the mobs revamped for the current level cap and all the loot similarly upgraded. They also come in all the regular flavors - Solo, Heroic I and Heroic II.</p><p>My experience with Fabled dungeons at the time they first appear has been patchy. There have been some I\'ve been able to make progress in but mostly they\'re too tough for me. I usually give them a go, decide it\'s too much like hard work and leave them for later. Sometimes I do come back and finish them when I\'m a bit tougher, sometimes I forget they exist.</p><p>I was fully expecting the first one I tried, <i>Fabled Temple of the Faceless</i>, to be at least as hard as Spiral of Vul. I mean, you\'d think so, woudn\'t you? It\'s six months later, after all. What would be the point of adding something easier to the game at level cap?</p><p>It <i>was </i>easier. It was a lot easier. At least it was once I got myself sorted out.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/s639/eq2tofs2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/w400-h388/eq2tofs2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>The zone-in is much more conveniently placed, right on the dock where you zone in to Sodden Archipelago. No flying right across the map this time. That was nice. You can access all the available dungeons from the update from the same portal, too. Also nice.<p></p><p>I picked the first instance on the list, zoned in and pulled a mob to test the waters. They were warm. The mob, a three-up arrow spider, theoretically tough for trash, died in a reasonable time and didn\'t pose much of&nbsp; threat. I worked my across the opening area towards the first boss, killing as I went and it felt comfortable. It wasn\'t a walkover but it wasn\'t a grind. I felt like I was moving through the zone at a reasonable pace.</p><p>I got in range of the boss and thought about looking him up for strats but I couldn\'t be bothered so I just pulled him to see what would happen. Nothing much. In fact, as far as he was concerned, nothing at all. His health stayed solidly at 100% no matter how hard and how often I hit him. Clearly there were unseen factors in play.</p><p>With my merc pumping out the healing and the Berserker having a pretty solid self-healing capacity of his own it was a stalemate, albeit one that was eventually only going to end one way, even if it was likely to take an hour to get there. I rummaged in my bags for a <i>Totem of Escape</i> to port myself to the zone entrance and couldn\'t find one so I just legged it to the zone-line with the boss beating on me all the way. He still didn\'t make much of a dent, even with my back turned.</p><p>Once I was safe outside, I looked at the wiki. It turns out there are two pillars, one in each of two side-temples, that have to be destroyed before the first boss can be damaged. I vaguely remembered that from whenever I did the dungeon when I was questing through the relevant expansion but that was years ago and I needed to be reminded.</p><p>I went back in, found the pillars, knocked them down, then had a second go at the boss. It went much better that time.&nbsp;</p><p>I was curious to see what he\'d drop. I was hoping it would be gear over 500 Resolve. In fact it was identical in quality to the Anniversary freebies - 525 Resolve. Since I was already fully kitted out in that, I was also hoping it wouldn\'t be Plate Armor. I could give that to my Inquisitor but she\'s not Level 130 yet so she\'d have to do five more levels before she could wear it.</p><p>I was hoping for cloth so my Necro could have it and cloth was what I got. On the first boss, anyway.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/s1249/eq2totf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/w640-h302/eq2totf1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>It had been fun and profitable so far so I carried on. Temple of The Faceless is a fairly compact, to the point dungeon, without a lot of wandering about required. Exactly what I was looking for. I progressed through the next two bosses, checking strats just in case of any more surprises but having very little trouble with either.</p><p>That took me up to bedtime so I camped where I was and picked up again where I left off the next morning. There was only one more boss left but it was a dragon and they can be tricky. In the event, though, he went down as easily as the rest.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn\'t get any more cloth armor but my Bruiser is going to be happy. The rest was all leather. The two sessions were fun, the difficulty just about right for me, requiring a certain amount of attention and concentration but not so much I couldn\'t take a few screenshots during the fights.</p><p>There are several more Fabled instances in the update so I\'ll most likely take a look at those next. The deciding factor on whether I do or not will be how much fun I\'m having. The upgraded loot is nice but I\'m all too aware it will be made obsolete by the free handouts at the start of the coming expansion, let alone the quest rewards from the storyline.</p><p>Not to mention there\'s the stuff the pandas are handing out. Which reminds me. As of this week\'s reset, I must have a new panda quest to do...</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/facing-off-with-faceless.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/facing-off-with-faceless.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBJOyn_Pz0YPxTzbK92J9KR38Y5hmxD8PRKjE6FYzafmUwlwzS-v3HN5uXn_Qi8w04K648eADQE7zrryeMz6DHr5NZr-vOXdMydJ_Lb3EAwPKu-DaxVoPxOqINCDTwQi4y3Ft19Hnw6t7HOeS_qNBRYXyoHaQ27rJDAWR_J8OpHmq3BU7X2T3NN3BC-Us/s72-w640-h362-c/eq2templered1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

I finally ran out of things I\nwrote or recorded in the 70s, 80s and 90s that I could refashion or remake into\nnew songs using AI. It\'s taken me more than six months, hacking away at the past\na little more every day, but now it\'s clear cut and there\'s nothing left but\nstumps.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Well, okay, not exactly. I could give the longer pieces another pass or two.\n  See if there\'s anything I missed. I didn\'t really pry all that much away from\n  the longer of the two extended pieces of fiction because most of it seemed\n  unsuitable for conversion into song lyrics but maybe a different musical genre\n  would shake something else loose. Everything can\'t be sad dreampop.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And there might be the odd fragment I haven\'t found, left lurking somewhere in\n  the house. I can think of a couple of pieces I remember writing that haven\'t\n  turned up yet. One of them would be perfect. But if they still exist, I\'ve run\n  out of ideas on where to look. They weren\'t in the loft and that was my last\n  hope.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or maybe not. There are a couple of outside possibilities. I doubt very much\n  that I\'m likely to find any of the printed zines but I have a couple of PC\n  floppy disks I haven\'t been able to read. If I could get into those...&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUFcYPzNomdYhN9i6T9YmCgT6-E_ztXasCueZBId2mbEQNCy-vq7v26t_xsJTC4EhmnYf1_oiJL7CJp-CP5PALIg2D4LdZQDcyfKLiosvcQQXeBDR0T6oCd4TfpnSlG2ZDXgJtou2y7j-CmionHjttFbMBG2qRvEppPp6ooYoGOgdKZOPodiVqSQD0ARk/s4080/20250901_165045.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUFcYPzNomdYhN9i6T9YmCgT6-E_ztXasCueZBId2mbEQNCy-vq7v26t_xsJTC4EhmnYf1_oiJL7CJp-CP5PALIg2D4LdZQDcyfKLiosvcQQXeBDR0T6oCd4TfpnSlG2ZDXgJtou2y7j-CmionHjttFbMBG2qRvEppPp6ooYoGOgdKZOPodiVqSQD0ARk/w300-h400/20250901_165045.jpg" width="300" /></a>\n</div>\nAnd before I got the PC in the mid-90s I\'m pretty sure I wrote everything on my\nAmiga 500. Which I still have. And the disks. The problem there is that I\'d need\na CRT monitor to plug the Amiga into and I got rid of the last of those just\nafter the pandemic, when I was having a clear-out. One more piece of evidence to\nsupport my belief that decluttering is never a good idea.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was looking into it and it seems you can get various adapters to connect an\n  Amiga to an HDMI display but my experience with such things in the past has\n  not always been great and honestly I don\'t think I can be bothered. If I\'m\n  honest, I don\'t even want to dig the Amiga out from the inaccessible\n  hidey-hole I buried it in when I was almost sure I\'d never want to use it\n  again...\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, I think I\'m just going to have to accept that those last, few fragments\n  are gone for good. And that\'s okay. I\'ve recovered and restored a huge\n  percentage of everything I ever did, most of which I thought I\'d never see\n  again and none of which I ever imagined would have such a scintillating\n  afterlife.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s been a revelation, rediscovering eveything I wrote and recorded decades\n  ago, finding much of it was far better than I remembered and then turning it\n  all into something new that\'s given me an extraordinary amount of pleasure and\n  satisfaction in its own right. I think it\'s okay to let a few scraps fall\n  through the floorboards.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There is another very good reason to call a halt to the crate-digging, too. If\n  I don\'t have any more old stuff to rely on, I\'ll have to start making some\n  new. That would be a whole different adventure, wouldn\'t it?\n</p>\n<p>\n  I probably ought to start by finishing the pieces I left unfinished back\n  around the turn of the millennium. One, supposedly a novel, I stopped mostly\n  because I didn\'t know where to go with it next. The other, an episodic string\n  of vignettes, left off, as I now realize, at a very unhappy moment in the\n  story.&nbsp;Both of those deserve proper endings.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After that, maybe I might even come up with a new idea. That\'d be the first\n  this century. I don\'t believe I\'ve had a new idea since the mid-90s. I\'m\n  assuming they still exist. It might be a myth.\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqM_qB_5MUk1umW7nyA57PBI1DHy5_B_or14xVa7ClQPyH0pErluPO4kfgJIzXLuI0NiZhyphenhyphenflcHiJVg62zoNq-oGlrqTMU5xjIJrcq5aQ4OZXHasOCW43x69pD_T5DaRNCtZ4mnJSEfCC1HfQl1zLMZW4KfG65E90kcNFHiDnk3oqLIATx1IOf4FvWnPI/s4080/20250901_165055.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqM_qB_5MUk1umW7nyA57PBI1DHy5_B_or14xVa7ClQPyH0pErluPO4kfgJIzXLuI0NiZhyphenhyphenflcHiJVg62zoNq-oGlrqTMU5xjIJrcq5aQ4OZXHasOCW43x69pD_T5DaRNCtZ4mnJSEfCC1HfQl1zLMZW4KfG65E90kcNFHiDnk3oqLIATx1IOf4FvWnPI/w300-h400/20250901_165055.jpg" width="300" /></a>\n</div>\n  New ideas are scary, though, and so is making art. Curating it is a lot more\n  comfortable. Perhaps I\'d have a better time organizing what I already have and\n  figuring out some way to present it in public. Not that I have any illusions\n  there\'s a public out there likely to take an interest but I figure it\'s better\n  to offer it than not, even if there are no takers.\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  That\'s a thought that deserves some analysis, isn\'t it? Why does any creative\n  act <i>need </i>to be shared? Surely the act of creation is sufficient in\n  itself. And if an audience <i>is </i>required, <i>I </i>am it. I mean, I\n  really appreciate my own work. In making it public, would I be sharing it in a\n  spirit of benevolence, offering up something I feel is valuable and worthwhile\n  for the pleasure and entertainment of others? Or would I just be looking for\n  validation and applause?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Yeah, I don\'t really care much about all that introspective nonsense. Mostly,\n  I\'d like it on the web because that maximizes its chances of survival over a\n  longer time-frame and I\'m broadly of the opinion that things should persist\n  whenever possible. Besides, someone might get some use or pleasure out of it\n  one day. Also, it\'d be really convenient for me to have it all in one place,\n  even if that was actually several places, as in multiple blogs or websites,\n  with the "<i>one place</i>" in that scenario being the collective wrapper of\n  the internet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As you may have realized by now, those who\'ve stayed with me this far, this\n  isn\'t so much a blog post as a conversation I\'m having with myself as I try to\n  decide what to do next. Coming to the end of the ongoing project I\'ve been\n  engaged with for most of this year has unsettled me a little and this is me,\n  trying to think it through and figure out what comes next.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And do you know what comes next right now? You won\'t guess. I\'ll tell\n  you.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m going to go into the bedroom, open the door to the cupboard where the hot\n  water tank is and rummage through the shelves beneath it, where I keep all the\n  very old clothes I\'m never going to wear again but haven\'t gotten as far as\n  throwing out yet. I\'m hoping that among them I\'ll find a T--shirt I bought in\n  Antequerra about thirty years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That T-shirt, which got too small and old to wear decades ago, has a cartoon\n  on the front of five young women. They aren\'t characters from a comic or a\n  movie or a show. They\'re just five people someone drew and presumably sold to\n  someone else, who turned the image into a piece of clothing that ended up in a\n  shop in a backstreet of a middle-sized town in Andalusia, where I found it and\n  bought it for no reason other than I liked the look of the characters.\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>And then, later, I gave them all names and wrote a story about them. Which is\n  one of the pieces that so far hasn\'t come to light.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t really think seeing the image again will bring any of the names I gave\n  them back to me. Except I already know what one of them is called because she\n  turns up as a character in that series of vignettes I<i>&nbsp;</i>mentioned.\n</p>\n<p>\n  She\'s called Cat and I\'m hoping if I can find the shirt I\'ll remember which of\n  the five she is. So let me just go see if I can find it...\n</p>\n<p>\n  ... and no, I can\'t. I have, however, discovered the hot water tank is rusting\n  and needs to be replaced immediately, so that was... lucky?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Also, a reminder that there are things more pressing in life than either\n  writing blog posts or worrying about what happened to short stories you wrote\n  half a lifetime ago. And with that I think I\'ll go do something useful for a\n  change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Notes on AI used in this post</span></b></p><p>Just the music, which was created using&nbsp;<i>Suno </i>from a guide vocal uploaded by me. Actually, I whistled the tune. Mostly I sing them but some days my voice just isn\'t willing to co-operate and that apparently was one of those days.&nbsp;</p><p>All the lyrics are mine, adapted from the penultimate paragraph, which reads as follows:</p><p>"<i>Rachel sometimes does fireworks for us, just as it gets dark, and I help with the snow statues. If I feel lonely she\'ll hold me, if I ask. When I\'m tired I go up to my little room and close the door. I think Rachel has a room somewhere, but I\'ve never seen it, Rachel is very real. Perhaps she\'s the real one, not me. Cat and Cathy, I don\'t know where they go. They\'re ghosts.</i>"</p><p>As you can see, I didn\'t change much, just added some emphasis and extra poignancy. I\'ve found the two techniques that work best for turning prose into lyrics are either to add a few rhymes or to use repetition. It\'s amazing how effectively repeated lines and phrases substitute for rhymes.</p><p>I ran lots of variations and fiddled around with them but in the end, the best one was the very first run. It happens that way more often than you\'d think. Suno sometimes seems to get worse the more you ask it to iterate.&nbsp;</p><p>The prompt was</p><p>&nbsp;"<span><i>strings, </i><span><i>cello, </i><span><i>soft, </i><span><i>sweet, </i><span><i>low, </i><span><i>husky female vocals, </i><span><i>Gentle, </i><span><i>soft, </i><span><i>quiet, </i><span><i>restrained, </i><span><i>understated chamber-pop soundscape throughout, </i><span><i>production very crisp and clear, </i><span><i>female vocals low and husky but soft and sweet, </i><span><i>Pitch is generally low, </i><span><i>a somber quality  indie-pop, </i><span><i>dreampop fuzz-pop, </i><span><i>simple subdued drums, </i><span><i>quiet simple bass, </i><span><i>quiet fuzzed guitars, </i><span><i>strings</i><span><span><span>"</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Again, I find repeating things, particularly at the beginning and end of a prompt, helps a lot.

It\'s taken me more than six months, hacking away at the past\na little more every day, but now it\'s clear cut and there\'s nothing left but\nstumps.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Well, okay, not exactly. I could give the longer pieces another pass or two.\n  See if there\'s anything I missed. I didn\'t really pry all that much away from\n  the longer of the two extended pieces of fiction because most of it seemed\n  unsuitable for conversion into song lyrics but maybe a different musical genre\n  would shake something else loose. Everything can\'t be sad dreampop.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And there might be the odd fragment I haven\'t found, left lurking somewhere in\n  the house. I can think of a couple of pieces I remember writing that haven\'t\n  turned up yet. One of them would be perfect. But if they still exist, I\'ve run\n  out of ideas on where to look. They weren\'t in the loft and that was my last\n  hope.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or maybe not. There are a couple of outside possibilities. I doubt very much\n  that I\'m likely to find any of the printed zines but I have a couple of PC\n  floppy disks I haven\'t been able to read. If I could get into those...&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUFcYPzNomdYhN9i6T9YmCgT6-E_ztXasCueZBId2mbEQNCy-vq7v26t_xsJTC4EhmnYf1_oiJL7CJp-CP5PALIg2D4LdZQDcyfKLiosvcQQXeBDR0T6oCd4TfpnSlG2ZDXgJtou2y7j-CmionHjttFbMBG2qRvEppPp6ooYoGOgdKZOPodiVqSQD0ARk/s4080/20250901_165045.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUFcYPzNomdYhN9i6T9YmCgT6-E_ztXasCueZBId2mbEQNCy-vq7v26t_xsJTC4EhmnYf1_oiJL7CJp-CP5PALIg2D4LdZQDcyfKLiosvcQQXeBDR0T6oCd4TfpnSlG2ZDXgJtou2y7j-CmionHjttFbMBG2qRvEppPp6ooYoGOgdKZOPodiVqSQD0ARk/w300-h400/20250901_165045.jpg" width="300" /></a>\n</div>\nAnd before I got the PC in the mid-90s I\'m pretty sure I wrote everything on my\nAmiga 500. Which I still have. And the disks. The problem there is that I\'d need\na CRT monitor to plug the Amiga into and I got rid of the last of those just\nafter the pandemic, when I was having a clear-out. One more piece of evidence to\nsupport my belief that decluttering is never a good idea.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was looking into it and it seems you can get various adapters to connect an\n  Amiga to an HDMI display but my experience with such things in the past has\n  not always been great and honestly I don\'t think I can be bothered. If I\'m\n  honest, I don\'t even want to dig the Amiga out from the inaccessible\n  hidey-hole I buried it in when I was almost sure I\'d never want to use it\n  again...\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, I think I\'m just going to have to accept that those last, few fragments\n  are gone for good. And that\'s okay. I\'ve recovered and restored a huge\n  percentage of everything I ever did, most of which I thought I\'d never see\n  again and none of which I ever imagined would have such a scintillating\n  afterlife.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s been a revelation, rediscovering eveything I wrote and recorded decades\n  ago, finding much of it was far better than I remembered and then turning it\n  all into something new that\'s given me an extraordinary amount of pleasure and\n  satisfaction in its own right. I think it\'s okay to let a few scraps fall\n  through the floorboards.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There is another very good reason to call a halt to the crate-digging, too. If\n  I don\'t have any more old stuff to rely on, I\'ll have to start making some\n  new. That would be a whole different adventure, wouldn\'t it?\n</p>\n<p>\n  I probably ought to start by finishing the pieces I left unfinished back\n  around the turn of the millennium. One, supposedly a novel, I stopped mostly\n  because I didn\'t know where to go with it next. The other, an episodic string\n  of vignettes, left off, as I now realize, at a very unhappy moment in the\n  story.&nbsp;Both of those deserve proper endings.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After that, maybe I might even come up with a new idea. That\'d be the first\n  this century. I don\'t believe I\'ve had a new idea since the mid-90s. I\'m\n  assuming they still exist. It might be a myth.\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqM_qB_5MUk1umW7nyA57PBI1DHy5_B_or14xVa7ClQPyH0pErluPO4kfgJIzXLuI0NiZhyphenhyphenflcHiJVg62zoNq-oGlrqTMU5xjIJrcq5aQ4OZXHasOCW43x69pD_T5DaRNCtZ4mnJSEfCC1HfQl1zLMZW4KfG65E90kcNFHiDnk3oqLIATx1IOf4FvWnPI/s4080/20250901_165055.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqM_qB_5MUk1umW7nyA57PBI1DHy5_B_or14xVa7ClQPyH0pErluPO4kfgJIzXLuI0NiZhyphenhyphenflcHiJVg62zoNq-oGlrqTMU5xjIJrcq5aQ4OZXHasOCW43x69pD_T5DaRNCtZ4mnJSEfCC1HfQl1zLMZW4KfG65E90kcNFHiDnk3oqLIATx1IOf4FvWnPI/w300-h400/20250901_165055.jpg" width="300" /></a>\n</div>\n  New ideas are scary, though, and so is making art. Curating it is a lot more\n  comfortable. Perhaps I\'d have a better time organizing what I already have and\n  figuring out some way to present it in public. Not that I have any illusions\n  there\'s a public out there likely to take an interest but I figure it\'s better\n  to offer it than not, even if there are no takers.\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  That\'s a thought that deserves some analysis, isn\'t it? Why does any creative\n  act <i>need </i>to be shared? Surely the act of creation is sufficient in\n  itself. And if an audience <i>is </i>required, <i>I </i>am it. I mean, I\n  really appreciate my own work. In making it public, would I be sharing it in a\n  spirit of benevolence, offering up something I feel is valuable and worthwhile\n  for the pleasure and entertainment of others? Or would I just be looking for\n  validation and applause?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Yeah, I don\'t really care much about all that introspective nonsense. Mostly,\n  I\'d like it on the web because that maximizes its chances of survival over a\n  longer time-frame and I\'m broadly of the opinion that things should persist\n  whenever possible. Besides, someone might get some use or pleasure out of it\n  one day. Also, it\'d be really convenient for me to have it all in one place,\n  even if that was actually several places, as in multiple blogs or websites,\n  with the "<i>one place</i>" in that scenario being the collective wrapper of\n  the internet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As you may have realized by now, those who\'ve stayed with me this far, this\n  isn\'t so much a blog post as a conversation I\'m having with myself as I try to\n  decide what to do next. Coming to the end of the ongoing project I\'ve been\n  engaged with for most of this year has unsettled me a little and this is me,\n  trying to think it through and figure out what comes next.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And do you know what comes next right now? You won\'t guess. I\'ll tell\n  you.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m going to go into the bedroom, open the door to the cupboard where the hot\n  water tank is and rummage through the shelves beneath it, where I keep all the\n  very old clothes I\'m never going to wear again but haven\'t gotten as far as\n  throwing out yet. I\'m hoping that among them I\'ll find a T--shirt I bought in\n  Antequerra about thirty years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That T-shirt, which got too small and old to wear decades ago, has a cartoon\n  on the front of five young women. They aren\'t characters from a comic or a\n  movie or a show. They\'re just five people someone drew and presumably sold to\n  someone else, who turned the image into a piece of clothing that ended up in a\n  shop in a backstreet of a middle-sized town in Andalusia, where I found it and\n  bought it for no reason other than I liked the look of the characters.\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>And then, later, I gave them all names and wrote a story about them. Which is\n  one of the pieces that so far hasn\'t come to light.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t really think seeing the image again will bring any of the names I gave\n  them back to me. Except I already know what one of them is called because she\n  turns up as a character in that series of vignettes I<i>&nbsp;</i>mentioned.\n</p>\n<p>\n  She\'s called Cat and I\'m hoping if I can find the shirt I\'ll remember which of\n  the five she is. So let me just go see if I can find it...\n</p>\n<p>\n  ... and no, I can\'t. I have, however, discovered the hot water tank is rusting\n  and needs to be replaced immediately, so that was... lucky?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Also, a reminder that there are things more pressing in life than either\n  writing blog posts or worrying about what happened to short stories you wrote\n  half a lifetime ago. And with that I think I\'ll go do something useful for a\n  change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Notes on AI used in this post</span></b></p><p>Just the music, which was created using&nbsp;<i>Suno </i>from a guide vocal uploaded by me. Actually, I whistled the tune. Mostly I sing them but some days my voice just isn\'t willing to co-operate and that apparently was one of those days.&nbsp;</p><p>All the lyrics are mine, adapted from the penultimate paragraph, which reads as follows:</p><p>"<i>Rachel sometimes does fireworks for us, just as it gets dark, and I help with the snow statues. If I feel lonely she\'ll hold me, if I ask. When I\'m tired I go up to my little room and close the door. I think Rachel has a room somewhere, but I\'ve never seen it, Rachel is very real. Perhaps she\'s the real one, not me. Cat and Cathy, I don\'t know where they go. They\'re ghosts.</i>"</p><p>As you can see, I didn\'t change much, just added some emphasis and extra poignancy. I\'ve found the two techniques that work best for turning prose into lyrics are either to add a few rhymes or to use repetition. It\'s amazing how effectively repeated lines and phrases substitute for rhymes.</p><p>I ran lots of variations and fiddled around with them but in the end, the best one was the very first run. It happens that way more often than you\'d think. Suno sometimes seems to get worse the more you ask it to iterate.&nbsp;</p><p>The prompt was</p><p>&nbsp;"<span><i>strings, </i><span><i>cello, </i><span><i>soft, </i><span><i>sweet, </i><span><i>low, </i><span><i>husky female vocals, </i><span><i>Gentle, </i><span><i>soft, </i><span><i>quiet, </i><span><i>restrained, </i><span><i>understated chamber-pop soundscape throughout, </i><span><i>production very crisp and clear, </i><span><i>female vocals low and husky but soft and sweet, </i><span><i>Pitch is generally low, </i><span><i>a somber quality  indie-pop, </i><span><i>dreampop fuzz-pop, </i><span><i>simple subdued drums, </i><span><i>quiet simple bass, </i><span><i>quiet fuzzed guitars, </i><span><i>strings</i><span><span><span>"</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Again, I find repeating things, particularly at the beginning and end of a prompt, helps a lot.

I was up to about a couple of\nhours a day, mostly last thing every night, but now I spend that time on my\nlaptop, burning through Credits on <i>Suno </i>and stitching fragments together\ninto songs in <i>Audacity</i>.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'m still paying several subscriptions to streaming services all the same,\n  though, so I feel obligated to make at least some use of all of them. We did\n  pause&nbsp;<i>Netflix </i>for three months but I re-started it for\n  <i>Wednesday </i>(And happily caught the finale of <i>Upload </i>around the\n  same time.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  While I was looking through the schedules for more to watch, so as to get my\n  money\'s-worth, I noticed the missing seasons of couple of shows I had been\n  following a few months ago had miraculously appeared.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  One of them was <i>Roswell: New Mexico,</i> for which Netflix very annoyingly\n  had held the license to Seasons 1 and 2 in the UK but not Seasons 3 and 4,\n  which&nbsp;were exclusive to <i>Sky </i>over here&nbsp;a the time (If I\n  remember right...). That was great but also too late because, when I finished\n  the first two seasons, I didn\'t want to pay yet another sub so I used a VPN to\n  watch them on Netflix USA.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even more annoying was <i>Young Sheldon</i>, for which Netflix had the rights\n  to stream six out of seven seasons in both the UK and the US but no rights to\n  the final season for either. That was on some US station or service I forget\n  now. All I do remember about it was that I couldn\'t watch it, even with a VPN.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, that agreement, whatever it was, must be over now because Netflix has\n  the full run available to stream. I was finally able to catch up with the\n  show. I\'ll tell you what I thought of it later.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Our other streaming service is <i>Amazon Prime </i>but that one pays for\n  itself in shipping alone, particularly since Mrs. Bhagpuss buys at least one\n  thing on <i>Amazon </i>pretty much every day. What with that and the games and\n  music offers included in the bundle, I feel no urge to watch anything on Prime\n  at all if I don\'t feel like it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The problem there is that I also have <i>Apple+</i> through Prime as an\n  add-on. It was very cheap for three months and I didn\'t really care if I was\n  watching anything on Apple+ or not but now it\'s back up to full price it seems\n  like I should at least watch <i>something</i>. Mrs Bhagpuss doesn\'t currently\n  watch anything on the channel at all so it\'s up to me to pick up the\n  slack.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Luckily, there\'s no shortage of good stuff to choose from. I thought about\n  starting several series about which I\'d heard good things -\n  <i>Severance, Slow Horses, Foundation, The Studio</i> - but in the end I\n  decided on <i>Ted Lasso</i>. Main reason: the episodes were shorter. Secondary\n  reason: I like sitcoms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have now watched all of Young Sheldon Season 7 and Ted Lasso Season 1. The\n  end of one story, the start of another. Here\'s what I thought about them both.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Young Sheldon</i> - Season 7</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was quite dubious about the whole concept of Young Sheldon to begin with.\n  I\'ve never been a huge fan of prequels (Is anyone?) and prequels built around\n  main characters as children can come across as a bit desperate. Added to that,\n  this is just one character from an ensemble show, one that relies almost\n  entirely on the particular skills of the specific actor who played him,\n  <i>and </i>it\'s a character often considered to be difficult and\n  controversial.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The prospects didn\'t look good but contrary to expectations it turned out to\n  be a warm, comfortable, enjoyable watch. A lot less spiky and brittle than the\n  show that spawned it, in fact.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, it also had one other, major problem, something common to all\n  long-running shows that revolve around a young child. Children grow up.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In one respect, that worked in Young Sheldon\'s favor. Old Sheldon, if we can\n  call him that, is a divisive figure in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. A lot of\n  people have some very valid objections to the character in terms of the way it\n  can appear to promote and perpetuate some stereotypically negative views of\n  neuro-diversity. I personally feel the full character arc, taken across the\n  entire run of the show, counters many of those objections, producing a nuanced\n  and distinctly positive image of someone struggling with numerous challenges\n  they find it hard to overcome.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if that\'s true, though, you\'d need to have watched the entire 279\n  episodes to appreciate it. And no-one who thinks Sheldon is an offensive\n  caricature is going to sit through 93 hours of a show that makes their skin\n  crawl just to see if maybe it wasn\'t quite as bad as they thought it was after\n  all. As the saying goes, that\'s an awful lot of Shawshank before you get to\n  the Redemption.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I didn\'t think Young Sheldon had the same level of difficulty. In <i>TBBT</i>,\n  there are five central characters and it\'s not hard to make an argument that\n  all of them are potentially offensive in the way they\'re written and\n  performed. Young Sheldon just has... young Sheldon. And he\'s kinda cute.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All those mannerisms and affectations that seem so mannered and performative\n  in an adult seem a lot softer and more relatable in a child. Kids, after all,\n  <i>do </i>say and do<i>&nbsp;</i>the darnedest things, don\'t they? And it is\n  undeniably satisfying, if you\'ve watched a lot of TBBT, to see many of\n  Sheldon\'s tropes and foibles from that show get their start in some specific\n  event in this one, usually for an understandable and sympathetic reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that is in the show as a whole, though. What about the final\n  season?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, the most striking thing about it is that Sheldon isn\'t actually in it\n  all that much. He\'s in every episode but he\'s rarely the central character and\n  the main story arcs seldom revolve around him. He\'s almost a peripheral\n  character at times, chipping in with a few side-stories or popping up to add\n  some extra perspective to someone else\'s story.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, it\'s about his family, all of whom get some significant character\n  development that changes or enhances what we knew about them. For example...\n</p>\n<p>(This bit might get a bit spoilery from here on down...)</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Meemaw </i>really starts to show her age as she loses her home, her\n  business and her freedom all in quick succession.

Missy and Georgie both seemed to age at a rate that allowed\n  the audience barely to notice it happening but by Season 7,<i>\n    Iain Armitage</i>, playing Sheldon, looked very odd indeed, like a much older child playing a\n  much younger one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The same mannerisms that had made him a cute-if-quirky kid turned him into a\n  slightly disturbing adolescent, never changing his expression, keeping his\n  hands stiffly by his sides and always wearing awkwardly formal clothes. That\n  looks funny in an eight-year old but uncomfortable and unsettling in a\n  teenager. It\'s not surprising they mostly wrote around him towards the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The ensemble cast was uniformly excellent. I liked everyone, which is ideal\n  for a sitcom. I especially enjoyed <i>Annie Potts </i>as Meemaw and her double\n  act with <i>Craig T Nelson</i> as her lover, <i>Dale</i>, was always a joy.\n  The entire cast - and it\'s a big one counting all the regular supporting parts\n  - was on top form throughout and possibly the highest praise I can offer is\n  that, by the end of the final season, I think I liked every one of the\n  characters more than I had at the start.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Actually, the highest praise I can offer is that I\'d happily watch the whole\n  run again. Which I almost certainly will.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Ted Lasso</i> - Season 1&nbsp;</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d heard a little about this show. I\'d heard it was heart-warming, upbeat and\n  positive. I\'d heard it was <i>nice</i>. I also knew it was about a sports\n  coach and, of course, that it was an American sitcom.&nbsp;When I was looking\n  for something to replace Young Sheldon, it seemed like another sweet slice of\n  Americana to send me off to sleep smiling.\n</p>\n<p>Yeah. About that...</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s not "<i>nice</i>", is it?&nbsp; It\'s not all that sweet either. It\'s\n  acerbic and sharp and occasionally even a little bitter. Ted Lasso (The\n  character no the show.) is irony personified.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For one thing, he may be American and a sports coach but he\'s not in America\n  and he\'s not coaching an American sport. Somehow, in all the things I\'d read,\n  I hadn\'t picked up on the "<i>Sit</i>" in the sitcom, which is that he\'s in\n  London, coaching at a Premier League football club.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Or, rather, managing one, which I\'m not sure they ever actually say. Everyone\n  keeps calling him "<i>Coach</i>" but he\'s doing the job we usually call\n  "<i>Manager</i>" over here and he has an actual coach standing next to him,\n  who everyone also calls "<i>Coach</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The show is full of oddnesses like that. I\'d say it does 98% of a great job of\n  being as convincing about life in modern Britain as 98% of British sitcoms can\n  manage but the 2% differences are wholly different in each case.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The writing doesn\'t actually lean that heavily into the\n  one-language-two-cultures comedy you\'d expect. There\'s plenty of that around\n  the margins but it\'s never the point of the show. Ironically, that makes the\n  moments when cultural infelicities do pop up all the more obvious.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, there\'s some considerable business in several episodes about\n  American sport not accepting a tie as a valid result. Which is fine. Except\n  that we don\'t really use the expression "tie" all that much over here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ted <i>always </i>uses the word "<i>tie</i>" in Season 1. Every British or\n  British-localized speaker he uses it to uses it back to him, frequently when\n  no-one here would ever use the word&nbsp;in that way. We\'d almost always say\n  "<i>draw</i>", which is what we call a sports match where the scores end up\n  tied.&nbsp; We use tie as a verb routinely but rarely as a noun.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, just to make it even more confusing, a "<i>tie</i>" as a noun in a\n  sporting comment usually means a fixture or a match. As in "<i>a cup tie</i>".\n  But then, a draw can be a fixture, too, as in "<i>We got Chelsea in the next round - that\'s a tough draw.</i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I can see how it could be confusing but I\'m not even that into sports and it\'s\n  all just second-nature to me because I grew up here. When the word-choices\n  don\'t ring true, it\'s distracting. And clearly I\'m not the only one who\n  noticed because, in the first episode of Season 2, when ties/draws become a\n  big plot point, both words are used and a context for the different usage is\n  established. It\'s just a shame they didn\'t think of that in Season 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of which might seem like nit-picking but it\'s a real nit-picking kind of\n  show. It\'s full of little bits of business about cultural differences and\n  expectations and about how sports teams operate, all of which revolve around\n  nuances of language and fine details of procedure or practice.\n</p>\n<p>I found all that quite engaging. And enlightening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  For example, a while back, <i>Wilhelm </i>posted something on\n  <i>TAGN </i>about bottled water and I left a comment in which I referred to\n  drinking carbonated bottled water, to which Wilhelm pointed out that Americans\n  generally wouldn\'t see much point in drinking fizzy water - they\'d just drink\n  soda if they wanted fizz.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did not know that. Despite having steeped myself in Americana, second-hand,\n  through comics, books, TV, music and movies since I was a child, I had never\n  come across the idea that sparkling water was un-American. And now here it is\n  as a running gag in Ted Lasso, where he keeps being given glasses of water to\n  drink and he takes a huge swig, expecting it to be plain, then spits it all\n  over himself or someone else because it turns out to be sparkling. Who\n  knew?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s plenty like that but the strength of the show isn\'t so much in the\n  jokes as the characters. Or perhaps I should say the caricatures, which is\n  what they seem like, at least in the first few episodes. It takes a good while\n  before the nuances and subtleties begin to reveal themselves or, I ought to\n  say, are revealed by the writers.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And by the end of the season, I still wasn\'t sure just how much depth lay\n  beneath most of the surfaces. The hints at anything more are so brief, so\n  fleeting, it sometimes felt as though I was imagining them. <i>Keeley </i>is a\n  bit older and smarter than she seems, <i>Coach Beard</i> has some quite\n  peculiar-sounding sexual history, <i>Jamie Tartt</i> has an overbearing dad...\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even as I try to tally those glimpses of character, though, I realize how\n  little is really there. Everything is suggestion, misdirection,\n  sleight-of-hand. After ten episodes, how much do we really know about anyone?\n  Not much more than you could write on an index card.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except, maybe, for Ted. <i>He </i>has some depths and they are, largely,\n  hidden. Not from the audience, who get to see him alone in his apartment at\n  night, but from everyone around him.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To everyone else, he\'s relentlessly upbeat but it doesn\'t seem to have gotten\n  him all that far. He coached one successful season of what I think must have\n  been college football and then got head-hunted by a vengeful divorcee in the\n  expectation his skills would not be transferable and he would be a disaster as\n  the "<i>coach</i>" of a top-flight club in the English Premier League, whose\n  prospects she hoped to damage so as to upset her (Unbearable.) ex.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Meanwhile, that very same relentlessly upbeat tendency is revealed as the\n  proximate cause of Ted\'s own impending divorce. He\'s so fucking nice his wife\n  can\'t stand to be around him any more.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Surprised by that swear-word I just threw in,&nbsp;seemingly so unnecessarily?\n  That\'s the show. It does that All. The. Time. It\'s another thing I wasn\'t\n  expecting. When someone tells you a sitcom is really nice and the main\n  character is really nice and "<i>nice</i>" is the word you hear associated\n  with it more than any other, you\'re probably expecting something along the\n  lines of a live-action <i>Wallace and Grommit. </i>Not a&nbsp;swear-fest.\n  Which is what you get.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a really sweary show. Everyone says "<i>fuck</i>" all the time. Except\n  Ted. Who also says it but only when it matters. Unlike&nbsp;over-the-hill\n  superstar <i>Roy Kent</i>, who has a series of running gags revolving around\n  the F-word, which he uses at every opportunity and in front of anyone\n  including, repeatedly and hilariously, his niece and a bunch of her eight-year\n  old pals. The funniest thing about it is his complete unawareness that it\'s\n  not entirely acceptable behavior. He ends up dropping a bunch of F-bombs in\n  his first post-footballing career gig as a TV pundit, which predictably\n  endears him to the audience, if not the presenters. (Although that\'s at the\n  start of Season 2 so I shouldn\'t mention it here...)\n</p>\n<p>\n  I do like me some good, creative swearing, so it\'s a plus point as far as I\'m\n  concerned. And Roy\'s probably my favorite character, unless that\'s Keeley.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a good show, sweary or not. I\'m not quite convinced it\'s a\n  <i>great </i>show, the way it seems to have been pitched in some of the things\n  I\'ve read about it, but it\'s funny and the characters are likeable and it has\n  that hard-to-resist sports narrative running in the background all the time,\n  where even though it\'s all made up, you still want to know whether the team is\n  going to win or not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just let\'s not talk about the actual footballing scenes. Has any show ever got\n  those right? I doubt it. Some of them here have been quite painful to watch,\n  and as I say I\'m not even a sports fan.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I am a sitcom fan, though, and this is a good one. I\'m on Season 2 now and I\n  notice, looking ahead, that the episodes are longer throughout. I\'m guessing\n  that means more plot and deeper characterization rather than more jokes but\n  I\'ll be happy, either way.\n</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKqBRN0umxps8SeA9OiEEcvgVRybKVRUahkxtHEfGt7iHDjMn_3zYVQ6wm3yRe3QDq4eeAowjxS2lIBI13qdE2jSDsaHiQFVFNBckcXV9tfcTZRMELR40ch6dFjmqB1t2CQ9LBlwp6QIUALBhEvQ2fuysMlhQrZg8P6Z7n-SZp6lC7BxAq5GAXEP5Gg_U/s1537/tls11.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="394" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKqBRN0umxps8SeA9OiEEcvgVRybKVRUahkxtHEfGt7iHDjMn_3zYVQ6wm3yRe3QDq4eeAowjxS2lIBI13qdE2jSDsaHiQFVFNBckcXV9tfcTZRMELR40ch6dFjmqB1t2CQ9LBlwp6QIUALBhEvQ2fuysMlhQrZg8P6Z7n-SZp6lC7BxAq5GAXEP5Gg_U/w640-h394/tls11.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Since I started using AI to make music, earlier in the year, my TV\nviewing, like my gaming, has taken a nose-dive. I was up to about a couple of\nhours a day, mostly last thing every night, but now I spend that time on my\nlaptop, burning through Credits on <i>Suno </i>and stitching fragments together\ninto songs in <i>Audacity</i>.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'m still paying several subscriptions to streaming services all the same,\n  though, so I feel obligated to make at least some use of all of them. We did\n  pause&nbsp;<i>Netflix </i>for three months but I re-started it for\n  <i>Wednesday </i>(And happily caught the finale of <i>Upload </i>around the\n  same time.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  While I was looking through the schedules for more to watch, so as to get my\n  money\'s-worth, I noticed the missing seasons of couple of shows I had been\n  following a few months ago had miraculously appeared.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  One of them was <i>Roswell: New Mexico,</i> for which Netflix very annoyingly\n  had held the license to Seasons 1 and 2 in the UK but not Seasons 3 and 4,\n  which&nbsp;were exclusive to <i>Sky </i>over here&nbsp;a the time (If I\n  remember right...). That was great but also too late because, when I finished\n  the first two seasons, I didn\'t want to pay yet another sub so I used a VPN to\n  watch them on Netflix USA.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even more annoying was <i>Young Sheldon</i>, for which Netflix had the rights\n  to stream six out of seven seasons in both the UK and the US but no rights to\n  the final season for either. That was on some US station or service I forget\n  now. All I do remember about it was that I couldn\'t watch it, even with a VPN.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, that agreement, whatever it was, must be over now because Netflix has\n  the full run available to stream. I was finally able to catch up with the\n  show. I\'ll tell you what I thought of it later.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Our other streaming service is <i>Amazon Prime </i>but that one pays for\n  itself in shipping alone, particularly since Mrs. Bhagpuss buys at least one\n  thing on <i>Amazon </i>pretty much every day. What with that and the games and\n  music offers included in the bundle, I feel no urge to watch anything on Prime\n  at all if I don\'t feel like it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The problem there is that I also have <i>Apple+</i> through Prime as an\n  add-on. It was very cheap for three months and I didn\'t really care if I was\n  watching anything on Apple+ or not but now it\'s back up to full price it seems\n  like I should at least watch <i>something</i>. Mrs Bhagpuss doesn\'t currently\n  watch anything on the channel at all so it\'s up to me to pick up the\n  slack.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Luckily, there\'s no shortage of good stuff to choose from. I thought about\n  starting several series about which I\'d heard good things -\n  <i>Severance, Slow Horses, Foundation, The Studio</i> - but in the end I\n  decided on <i>Ted Lasso</i>. Main reason: the episodes were shorter. Secondary\n  reason: I like sitcoms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have now watched all of Young Sheldon Season 7 and Ted Lasso Season 1. The\n  end of one story, the start of another. Here\'s what I thought about them both.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Young Sheldon</i> - Season 7</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was quite dubious about the whole concept of Young Sheldon to begin with.\n  I\'ve never been a huge fan of prequels (Is anyone?) and prequels built around\n  main characters as children can come across as a bit desperate. Added to that,\n  this is just one character from an ensemble show, one that relies almost\n  entirely on the particular skills of the specific actor who played him,\n  <i>and </i>it\'s a character often considered to be difficult and\n  controversial.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The prospects didn\'t look good but contrary to expectations it turned out to\n  be a warm, comfortable, enjoyable watch. A lot less spiky and brittle than the\n  show that spawned it, in fact.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, it also had one other, major problem, something common to all\n  long-running shows that revolve around a young child. Children grow up.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In one respect, that worked in Young Sheldon\'s favor. Old Sheldon, if we can\n  call him that, is a divisive figure in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. A lot of\n  people have some very valid objections to the character in terms of the way it\n  can appear to promote and perpetuate some stereotypically negative views of\n  neuro-diversity. I personally feel the full character arc, taken across the\n  entire run of the show, counters many of those objections, producing a nuanced\n  and distinctly positive image of someone struggling with numerous challenges\n  they find it hard to overcome.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if that\'s true, though, you\'d need to have watched the entire 279\n  episodes to appreciate it. And no-one who thinks Sheldon is an offensive\n  caricature is going to sit through 93 hours of a show that makes their skin\n  crawl just to see if maybe it wasn\'t quite as bad as they thought it was after\n  all. As the saying goes, that\'s an awful lot of Shawshank before you get to\n  the Redemption.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I didn\'t think Young Sheldon had the same level of difficulty. In <i>TBBT</i>,\n  there are five central characters and it\'s not hard to make an argument that\n  all of them are potentially offensive in the way they\'re written and\n  performed. Young Sheldon just has... young Sheldon. And he\'s kinda cute.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All those mannerisms and affectations that seem so mannered and performative\n  in an adult seem a lot softer and more relatable in a child. Kids, after all,\n  <i>do </i>say and do<i>&nbsp;</i>the darnedest things, don\'t they? And it is\n  undeniably satisfying, if you\'ve watched a lot of TBBT, to see many of\n  Sheldon\'s tropes and foibles from that show get their start in some specific\n  event in this one, usually for an understandable and sympathetic reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that is in the show as a whole, though. What about the final\n  season?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, the most striking thing about it is that Sheldon isn\'t actually in it\n  all that much. He\'s in every episode but he\'s rarely the central character and\n  the main story arcs seldom revolve around him. He\'s almost a peripheral\n  character at times, chipping in with a few side-stories or popping up to add\n  some extra perspective to someone else\'s story.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, it\'s about his family, all of whom get some significant character\n  development that changes or enhances what we knew about them. For example...\n</p>\n<p>(This bit might get a bit spoilery from here on down...)</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Meemaw </i>really starts to show her age as she loses her home, her\n  business and her freedom all in quick succession. Her veneer of invincibility\n  begins to peel away and her indomitable spirit wilts a little.\n  <i>Missy </i>shows a good deal of unexpected maturity and character growth as\n  does <i>Georgie</i>, albeit each in very different ways. Sheldon\'s mother\'s\n  religious beliefs start to move her closer to the mania seen in the adult\n  show, while his father... dies.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That was a shock, even though if I\'d been counting the passage of time I\nought to have expected it. It happens right towards the end of the run, just\nwhen everything seems to be going pretty well for him and the family.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was not best pleased when it happened, not only because I liked the\n  character as played by <i>Lance Barber</i> but because I had Young Sheldon\n  firmly in my "<i>Send me off to sleep in a good mood</i>." slot and it seemed\n  like it was going to finish with a couple of episodes where all the cast would\n  be in mourning and filled with grief.

And enlightening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  For example, a while back, <i>Wilhelm </i>posted something on\n  <i>TAGN </i>about bottled water and I left a comment in which I referred to\n  drinking carbonated bottled water, to which Wilhelm pointed out that Americans\n  generally wouldn\'t see much point in drinking fizzy water - they\'d just drink\n  soda if they wanted fizz.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did not know that. Despite having steeped myself in Americana, second-hand,\n  through comics, books, TV, music and movies since I was a child, I had never\n  come across the idea that sparkling water was un-American. And now here it is\n  as a running gag in Ted Lasso, where he keeps being given glasses of water to\n  drink and he takes a huge swig, expecting it to be plain, then spits it all\n  over himself or someone else because it turns out to be sparkling. Who\n  knew?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s plenty like that but the strength of the show isn\'t so much in the\n  jokes as the characters. Or perhaps I should say the caricatures, which is\n  what they seem like, at least in the first few episodes. It takes a good while\n  before the nuances and subtleties begin to reveal themselves or, I ought to\n  say, are revealed by the writers.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And by the end of the season, I still wasn\'t sure just how much depth lay\n  beneath most of the surfaces. The hints at anything more are so brief, so\n  fleeting, it sometimes felt as though I was imagining them. <i>Keeley </i>is a\n  bit older and smarter than she seems, <i>Coach Beard</i> has some quite\n  peculiar-sounding sexual history, <i>Jamie Tartt</i> has an overbearing dad...\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even as I try to tally those glimpses of character, though, I realize how\n  little is really there. Everything is suggestion, misdirection,\n  sleight-of-hand. After ten episodes, how much do we really know about anyone?\n  Not much more than you could write on an index card.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except, maybe, for Ted. <i>He </i>has some depths and they are, largely,\n  hidden. Not from the audience, who get to see him alone in his apartment at\n  night, but from everyone around him.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To everyone else, he\'s relentlessly upbeat but it doesn\'t seem to have gotten\n  him all that far. He coached one successful season of what I think must have\n  been college football and then got head-hunted by a vengeful divorcee in the\n  expectation his skills would not be transferable and he would be a disaster as\n  the "<i>coach</i>" of a top-flight club in the English Premier League, whose\n  prospects she hoped to damage so as to upset her (Unbearable.) ex.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Meanwhile, that very same relentlessly upbeat tendency is revealed as the\n  proximate cause of Ted\'s own impending divorce. He\'s so fucking nice his wife\n  can\'t stand to be around him any more.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Surprised by that swear-word I just threw in,&nbsp;seemingly so unnecessarily?\n  That\'s the show. It does that All. The. Time. It\'s another thing I wasn\'t\n  expecting. When someone tells you a sitcom is really nice and the main\n  character is really nice and "<i>nice</i>" is the word you hear associated\n  with it more than any other, you\'re probably expecting something along the\n  lines of a live-action <i>Wallace and Grommit. </i>Not a&nbsp;swear-fest.\n  Which is what you get.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a really sweary show. Everyone says "<i>fuck</i>" all the time. Except\n  Ted. Who also says it but only when it matters. Unlike&nbsp;over-the-hill\n  superstar <i>Roy Kent</i>, who has a series of running gags revolving around\n  the F-word, which he uses at every opportunity and in front of anyone\n  including, repeatedly and hilariously, his niece and a bunch of her eight-year\n  old pals. The funniest thing about it is his complete unawareness that it\'s\n  not entirely acceptable behavior. He ends up dropping a bunch of F-bombs in\n  his first post-footballing career gig as a TV pundit, which predictably\n  endears him to the audience, if not the presenters. (Although that\'s at the\n  start of Season 2 so I shouldn\'t mention it here...)\n</p>\n<p>\n  I do like me some good, creative swearing, so it\'s a plus point as far as I\'m\n  concerned. And Roy\'s probably my favorite character, unless that\'s Keeley.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a good show, sweary or not. I\'m not quite convinced it\'s a\n  <i>great </i>show, the way it seems to have been pitched in some of the things\n  I\'ve read about it, but it\'s funny and the characters are likeable and it has\n  that hard-to-resist sports narrative running in the background all the time,\n  where even though it\'s all made up, you still want to know whether the team is\n  going to win or not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just let\'s not talk about the actual footballing scenes. Has any show ever got\n  those right? I doubt it. Some of them here have been quite painful to watch,\n  and as I say I\'m not even a sports fan.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I am a sitcom fan, though, and this is a good one. I\'m on Season 2 now and I\n  notice, looking ahead, that the episodes are longer throughout. I\'m guessing\n  that means more plot and deeper characterization rather than more jokes but\n  I\'ll be happy, either way.\n</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/beginnings-and-endings.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/beginnings-and-endings.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKqBRN0umxps8SeA9OiEEcvgVRybKVRUahkxtHEfGt7iHDjMn_3zYVQ6wm3yRe3QDq4eeAowjxS2lIBI13qdE2jSDsaHiQFVFNBckcXV9tfcTZRMELR40ch6dFjmqB1t2CQ9LBlwp6QIUALBhEvQ2fuysMlhQrZg8P6Z7n-SZp6lC7BxAq5GAXEP5Gg_U/s72-w640-h394-c/tls11.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

But no-one playing TurtleWoW or THJ pays much attention to that inconvenient detail, for the very understandable reason that they\'ve already written the Live games off as a betrayal of the True Faith and would almost certainly not shed any tears if they disappeared tomorrow.<p></p><p>It leaves Blizzard and Daybreak looking like the worst combination of bullies, killjoys and incompetents as they try to put the very people who are doing what the players want out of business, while refusing to consider doing anything similar themselves, presumably because it would just be too hard for them. I mean, it\'s not like they make games for a living or anything...</p><p>Which leads me directly on to Irony #2, that being said players imagining that, should the teams behind their rogue servers of choice ever build up a sufficient head of steam to challenge the professional game developer elites, they\'d behave any differently. It\'s quite sweet, really.</p><p>There are lots of examples of tiny, dedicated, non-professional teams running retro servers for ancient MMORPGs wholly in the service and with the informed consent of the people who play them. They\'re wonderful. We all applaud their genuinely selfless efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>And note that they\'re hobbyists; developers and players alike.</p><p>They aren\'t running commercial businesses so they don\'t have to make compromises with quality or content to keep their kids in shoes. THJ and TurtleWoW aren\'t quite the same. They most likely are someone\'s livelihood already and if they continue to grow they certainly will be before long.&nbsp;</p><p>They may also be labors of love but so, for the most part, are the original, official games they\'re leeching off. Only, the developers of those games don\'t have the leeway to make noncommercial decisions just to please the players. The more successful their rogue equivalents become, the less leeway they\'ll have, too.</p><p>Which isn\'t to say they won\'t make a better job of balancing the commercial and the aesthetic but they sure as hell won\'t be able to keep all the players happy all the time, any more than any other live MMORPG ever has. And the longer the&nbsp;Classic +&nbsp;style experiments continue, the further they\'ll diverge from the One True Path and the more pissed off the players will get.</p><p>Finally, and most amusingly, there\'s the mortality issue. We\'ve been hearing a lot lately about games dying. Or being killed, rather, because apparently they don\'t just age out and pass away into the Great Gray Nothing all on their own. Someone has to administer the coup de grace.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRVqRQn67P24DU4-LMbcxnQkTSz1mzbAypHubw4G5M2U5H4LOqQO2y8LThHp6zDcxxMQJVBBoEVP7PaqlYDiFgSvhw6XppANSp5yFuIKjdyqFX1RXXGCsT77HQmP5AAFkEAmOSQADnRCSHLyl5nSFRhcqdxB12ute8855-s2jqLF7y62Z4zyeyZ-Ajfz8/s1920/eqgrey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRVqRQn67P24DU4-LMbcxnQkTSz1mzbAypHubw4G5M2U5H4LOqQO2y8LThHp6zDcxxMQJVBBoEVP7PaqlYDiFgSvhw6XppANSp5yFuIKjdyqFX1RXXGCsT77HQmP5AAFkEAmOSQADnRCSHLyl5nSFRhcqdxB12ute8855-s2jqLF7y62Z4zyeyZ-Ajfz8/w640-h342/eqgrey1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>My question is, if someone\'s out there killing them, why don\'t the buggers ever die?&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, they <i>used </i>to, right? Even a hint that an MMORPG I\'d played and enjoyed and felt a connection with might be about to close down for good used to make me come out in a cold sweat. Quite literally in the case of a handful that I <i>really </i>liked.</p><p>Nowadays, about the best I can summon is a shrug. There\'s no emotional impact when I hear a game I used to play is about to sail into the ultimate west because I know that, should I ever get the urge to play it again, I can just hop onto an emulator.</p><p>The whole post-sunset after-life is so much a part of the process now, <i>Massively OP</i> just ran <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/09/23/the-daily-grind-does-your-mmorpg-have-an-emulator-backup-plan-for-when-the-lights-go-out/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a post</span></a> asking readers if the people playing their MMO of choice had a back-up plan in place to spin up an emulator in the event of the real game closing down. It\'s expected now, apparently, and the wise players are far enough ahead of the curve to guarantee there\'s barely a bump as players switch tracks when the official servers power down.</p><p>It seems like the greatest irony of all, the way the one genre that should be the most vulnerable to executive kill orders, due to being both entirely online <i>and </i>running mostly on someone else\'s hardware, ends up being the least likely of all to go dark for more than a blink.&nbsp;</p><p>And it doesn\'t even take a closure for the resurrection to come.</p><p>In the case of the two games mentioned at the top of the post, neither of which has yet given the slightest indication that official service is in imminent danger of being withdrawn, there are dozens of unofficial alternatives available already. EQ even has not one but <i>two</i>&nbsp;authorized, non-commercial third-party alternatives in place! You can go play EverQuest on <i>Project 99</i> or <i>Quarm </i>just as legally as you can play on Daybreak\'s own servers.&nbsp;</p><p>Blizzard haven\'t quite countenanced that yet but they\'ve made it pretty plain they aren\'t interested in closing down every last fan project out there. Just the ones that try to make money.&nbsp;</p><p>I used to like to say that WoW would probably be around longer than I\'d be around to play it. At the time I was thinking of the official version, which seemed likely to last for decades and still does. Eventually, though, Blizzard will shut it down. I won\'t see it happen but you might.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8VTs1PZQ9IFs9FYif0P738ATnaFz7_P95Z_Z5NslVtpKBWLY74J7c8fujAsrrdQpJ1IzZoK9oi9GPlFu3lGZgbHuFNBNaFcTZVP27xejkLFKBtS7a65XV0pZ_VFM_G3sQzuvFqCHFNVDAkXvbxHJx8LSPDK6Zy3Qz08A8Ve4gunmBhKxQS7tmpj7BbLs/s1920/eqwk1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8VTs1PZQ9IFs9FYif0P738ATnaFz7_P95Z_Z5NslVtpKBWLY74J7c8fujAsrrdQpJ1IzZoK9oi9GPlFu3lGZgbHuFNBNaFcTZVP27xejkLFKBtS7a65XV0pZ_VFM_G3sQzuvFqCHFNVDAkXvbxHJx8LSPDK6Zy3Qz08A8Ve4gunmBhKxQS7tmpj7BbLs/w640-h342/eqwk1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The game itself, though, by which I mean some playable version that\'s instantly recognizable as World of Warcraft? That\'s going to be around long after anyone reading this is still here to enjoy it. And so will EverQuest. And many of the others.&nbsp;<p></p><p>There\'ll be no final curtain for any of them, although the day may come when they\'re playing to empty houses. Interest will ebb before opportunity.</p><p>Is that a good thing? I\'m all for historical preservation and personal choice. If people want to play the same game for fifty years, let them. It\'s not without repercussions and consequences, though.</p><p>Daybreak have made the extent to which The Hero\'s Journey\'s success damages their bottom line very plain. Blizzard is going after Turtle WoW for much the same reason, although as part of <i>Microsoft </i>now they have almost infinitely deep pockets, meaning the competition can hardly have the same impact. WoW isn\'t going to close down because TurtleWoW steals a few thousand of its players. EverQuest just might, though, if the shortfall in expected revenue DBG ascribes to THJ\'s success is accurate.</p><p>But even if they both went under, we\'d still be able to play, right? We\'d just roll up new characters on the emulators and start over. So why worry?</p><p>Possibly because all those people playing games that were made twenty or more years ago are sopping up players who could be playing something new, thereby contributing to the much-discussed difficulty every new MMORPG experiences in both attracting and holding an audience.&nbsp;</p><p>And if that\'s happening already, imagine how much stronger the effect might be if those games weren\'t just replicating old experiences but were actively engaged in creating new ones. Every action has consequences, not always intended or foreseen.</p><p>And maybe that\'s the greatest irony of all. If the old games won\'t die, how are new ones going to live?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mostly by not looking or playing anything like the old ones, I\'d imagine...&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p><i></i></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHVRssSyW6DIsdoYCYKIVledki5itnsqD3lRJdS6Bg6M1pDmvQcVl23zrxUn0RkIM03g4y9FGdk9Hfbcf_0Egp8rxGh0cySb_fuJO5B4lh9Vh-HDVaJV-h6KZ1BntfXi2vlu9XsARLgX3Pzw644YQ0FdP-PqSS4EbjASNAdgbEVbnCTUsBTx2AEKQSVv0/s1920/eqspires1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHVRssSyW6DIsdoYCYKIVledki5itnsqD3lRJdS6Bg6M1pDmvQcVl23zrxUn0RkIM03g4y9FGdk9Hfbcf_0Egp8rxGh0cySb_fuJO5B4lh9Vh-HDVaJV-h6KZ1BntfXi2vlu9XsARLgX3Pzw644YQ0FdP-PqSS4EbjASNAdgbEVbnCTUsBTx2AEKQSVv0/w640-h342/eqspires1.jpg" width="640" /></a></i></div><i><br />Wilhelm </i>at <i>The Ancient Gaming Noob</i> has <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/28/repercussions-and-tantrums-in-the-eq-emulator-world-around-the-heroes-journey/">a post</a> up about the fallout from <i>Daybreak Games</i>\' ongoing legal battle with whoever it is that operates the for-profit <i>EverQuest </i>rogue server, <i>The Hero\'s Journey</i>.

Unfortunately for them, this eminently reasonable position is currently being undermined by the highly-visible evidence of much smaller, less well-funded teams seemingly doing exactly that.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWXN-h2jYjC9pZgaZqrOveTJSXDVlDK3f_vdUxP6RtbXGzahQFWRQagaV9V2Dq7a8O_T85V-f1ksm-S4PHiO7F9mvgAC3FGbBBQr6O6VWaMVkHsExKxL0LgjTKKAIB5y3pNocs8Xhn3MSWgbacjZfJdqVu3X28yJNk7XZsNKV1am2y8G196mn3qxlEccg/s1280/eqquiil1.bmp" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="512" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWXN-h2jYjC9pZgaZqrOveTJSXDVlDK3f_vdUxP6RtbXGzahQFWRQagaV9V2Dq7a8O_T85V-f1ksm-S4PHiO7F9mvgAC3FGbBBQr6O6VWaMVkHsExKxL0LgjTKKAIB5y3pNocs8Xhn3MSWgbacjZfJdqVu3X28yJNk7XZsNKV1am2y8G196mn3qxlEccg/w640-h512/eqquiil1.bmp" width="640" /></a></div>Only without the encumbrance of an actual, much more popular, live game to run at the same time, of course. But no-one playing TurtleWoW or THJ pays much attention to that inconvenient detail, for the very understandable reason that they\'ve already written the Live games off as a betrayal of the True Faith and would almost certainly not shed any tears if they disappeared tomorrow.<p></p><p>It leaves Blizzard and Daybreak looking like the worst combination of bullies, killjoys and incompetents as they try to put the very people who are doing what the players want out of business, while refusing to consider doing anything similar themselves, presumably because it would just be too hard for them. I mean, it\'s not like they make games for a living or anything...</p><p>Which leads me directly on to Irony #2, that being said players imagining that, should the teams behind their rogue servers of choice ever build up a sufficient head of steam to challenge the professional game developer elites, they\'d behave any differently. It\'s quite sweet, really.</p><p>There are lots of examples of tiny, dedicated, non-professional teams running retro servers for ancient MMORPGs wholly in the service and with the informed consent of the people who play them. They\'re wonderful. We all applaud their genuinely selfless efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>And note that they\'re hobbyists; developers and players alike.</p><p>They aren\'t running commercial businesses so they don\'t have to make compromises with quality or content to keep their kids in shoes. THJ and TurtleWoW aren\'t quite the same. They most likely are someone\'s livelihood already and if they continue to grow they certainly will be before long.&nbsp;</p><p>They may also be labors of love but so, for the most part, are the original, official games they\'re leeching off. Only, the developers of those games don\'t have the leeway to make noncommercial decisions just to please the players. The more successful their rogue equivalents become, the less leeway they\'ll have, too.</p><p>Which isn\'t to say they won\'t make a better job of balancing the commercial and the aesthetic but they sure as hell won\'t be able to keep all the players happy all the time, any more than any other live MMORPG ever has. And the longer the&nbsp;Classic +&nbsp;style experiments continue, the further they\'ll diverge from the One True Path and the more pissed off the players will get.</p><p>Finally, and most amusingly, there\'s the mortality issue. We\'ve been hearing a lot lately about games dying. Or being killed, rather, because apparently they don\'t just age out and pass away into the Great Gray Nothing all on their own. Someone has to administer the coup de grace.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRVqRQn67P24DU4-LMbcxnQkTSz1mzbAypHubw4G5M2U5H4LOqQO2y8LThHp6zDcxxMQJVBBoEVP7PaqlYDiFgSvhw6XppANSp5yFuIKjdyqFX1RXXGCsT77HQmP5AAFkEAmOSQADnRCSHLyl5nSFRhcqdxB12ute8855-s2jqLF7y62Z4zyeyZ-Ajfz8/s1920/eqgrey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRVqRQn67P24DU4-LMbcxnQkTSz1mzbAypHubw4G5M2U5H4LOqQO2y8LThHp6zDcxxMQJVBBoEVP7PaqlYDiFgSvhw6XppANSp5yFuIKjdyqFX1RXXGCsT77HQmP5AAFkEAmOSQADnRCSHLyl5nSFRhcqdxB12ute8855-s2jqLF7y62Z4zyeyZ-Ajfz8/w640-h342/eqgrey1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>My question is, if someone\'s out there killing them, why don\'t the buggers ever die?&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, they <i>used </i>to, right? Even a hint that an MMORPG I\'d played and enjoyed and felt a connection with might be about to close down for good used to make me come out in a cold sweat. Quite literally in the case of a handful that I <i>really </i>liked.</p><p>Nowadays, about the best I can summon is a shrug. There\'s no emotional impact when I hear a game I used to play is about to sail into the ultimate west because I know that, should I ever get the urge to play it again, I can just hop onto an emulator.</p><p>The whole post-sunset after-life is so much a part of the process now, <i>Massively OP</i> just ran <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/09/23/the-daily-grind-does-your-mmorpg-have-an-emulator-backup-plan-for-when-the-lights-go-out/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a post</span></a> asking readers if the people playing their MMO of choice had a back-up plan in place to spin up an emulator in the event of the real game closing down. It\'s expected now, apparently, and the wise players are far enough ahead of the curve to guarantee there\'s barely a bump as players switch tracks when the official servers power down.</p><p>It seems like the greatest irony of all, the way the one genre that should be the most vulnerable to executive kill orders, due to being both entirely online <i>and </i>running mostly on someone else\'s hardware, ends up being the least likely of all to go dark for more than a blink.&nbsp;</p><p>And it doesn\'t even take a closure for the resurrection to come.</p><p>In the case of the two games mentioned at the top of the post, neither of which has yet given the slightest indication that official service is in imminent danger of being withdrawn, there are dozens of unofficial alternatives available already. EQ even has not one but <i>two</i>&nbsp;authorized, non-commercial third-party alternatives in place! You can go play EverQuest on <i>Project 99</i> or <i>Quarm </i>just as legally as you can play on Daybreak\'s own servers.&nbsp;</p><p>Blizzard haven\'t quite countenanced that yet but they\'ve made it pretty plain they aren\'t interested in closing down every last fan project out there. Just the ones that try to make money.&nbsp;</p><p>I used to like to say that WoW would probably be around longer than I\'d be around to play it. At the time I was thinking of the official version, which seemed likely to last for decades and still does. Eventually, though, Blizzard will shut it down. I won\'t see it happen but you might.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8VTs1PZQ9IFs9FYif0P738ATnaFz7_P95Z_Z5NslVtpKBWLY74J7c8fujAsrrdQpJ1IzZoK9oi9GPlFu3lGZgbHuFNBNaFcTZVP27xejkLFKBtS7a65XV0pZ_VFM_G3sQzuvFqCHFNVDAkXvbxHJx8LSPDK6Zy3Qz08A8Ve4gunmBhKxQS7tmpj7BbLs/s1920/eqwk1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8VTs1PZQ9IFs9FYif0P738ATnaFz7_P95Z_Z5NslVtpKBWLY74J7c8fujAsrrdQpJ1IzZoK9oi9GPlFu3lGZgbHuFNBNaFcTZVP27xejkLFKBtS7a65XV0pZ_VFM_G3sQzuvFqCHFNVDAkXvbxHJx8LSPDK6Zy3Qz08A8Ve4gunmBhKxQS7tmpj7BbLs/w640-h342/eqwk1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The game itself, though, by which I mean some playable version that\'s instantly recognizable as World of Warcraft? That\'s going to be around long after anyone reading this is still here to enjoy it. And so will EverQuest. And many of the others.&nbsp;<p></p><p>There\'ll be no final curtain for any of them, although the day may come when they\'re playing to empty houses. Interest will ebb before opportunity.</p><p>Is that a good thing? I\'m all for historical preservation and personal choice. If people want to play the same game for fifty years, let them. It\'s not without repercussions and consequences, though.</p><p>Daybreak have made the extent to which The Hero\'s Journey\'s success damages their bottom line very plain. Blizzard is going after Turtle WoW for much the same reason, although as part of <i>Microsoft </i>now they have almost infinitely deep pockets, meaning the competition can hardly have the same impact. WoW isn\'t going to close down because TurtleWoW steals a few thousand of its players. EverQuest just might, though, if the shortfall in expected revenue DBG ascribes to THJ\'s success is accurate.</p><p>But even if they both went under, we\'d still be able to play, right? We\'d just roll up new characters on the emulators and start over. So why worry?</p><p>Possibly because all those people playing games that were made twenty or more years ago are sopping up players who could be playing something new, thereby contributing to the much-discussed difficulty every new MMORPG experiences in both attracting and holding an audience.&nbsp;</p><p>And if that\'s happening already, imagine how much stronger the effect might be if those games weren\'t just replicating old experiences but were actively engaged in creating new ones. Every action has consequences, not always intended or foreseen.</p><p>And maybe that\'s the greatest irony of all. If the old games won\'t die, how are new ones going to live?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mostly by not looking or playing anything like the old ones, I\'d imagine...&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/a-free-ride-when-youve-already-paid-or.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/a-free-ride-when-youve-already-paid-or.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHVRssSyW6DIsdoYCYKIVledki5itnsqD3lRJdS6Bg6M1pDmvQcVl23zrxUn0RkIM03g4y9FGdk9Hfbcf_0Egp8rxGh0cySb_fuJO5B4lh9Vh-HDVaJV-h6KZ1BntfXi2vlu9XsARLgX3Pzw644YQ0FdP-PqSS4EbjASNAdgbEVbnCTUsBTx2AEKQSVv0/s72-w640-h342-c/eqspires1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '8'}

Also not remotely accurate. I have a\n  whole slew of things I could write about but none of them is suitable for the\n  hour or two I have available to put something together.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  So I\'m not going to bother. I\'m going to say one thing about a gaming event, get AI to make me a header image, stick a song on the tail-end and call it done.\n  Pathetic, isn\'t it?\n</p>\n<p>Let\'s start with the gaming thing. One of the games I\'m theoretically&nbsp;but not actually still\n  playing is <i>Once Human</i>. I went on and on about\n  how much better it\'d be if they\'d just give us permanent servers where we\n  could settle down like it was a regular MMORPG and then they did and I pretty much never logged in again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I still have <i>OH </i>installed and, I think, updated, so I could go back at\n  any moment. I just need a push. And now I have one. Or I will have, in about a\n  month\'s time.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once Human is hosting\n  <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/09/25/once-human-preps-palworld-collab-launches-new-test-scenario-and-visional-wheel-season/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a collaboration</span></a>\n  with... <i>Palworld</i>. I know! It sounds nuts, doesn\'t it? Until you think\n  about it.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Apart from one looking like it was designed by a sugared-up eight-year old and\n  the other by a teenage techno-goth, the two games are really quite similar.\n  They\'re both open world survival games with a large building component and\n  most importantly they both rely very heavily on capturing creatures and\n  putting them to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In Palworld it\'s <i>Pals</i>. In Once Human it\'s <i>Deviants</i>. Pals roam around your\n  home. Deviants roam around your home. Pals come with you and fight stuff.\n  Deviants come with you and fight stuff. Pals let you do things you couldn\'t\n  otherwise do. Deviants...\n</p>\n<p>\n  You get the idea. The mechanics are really very similar indeed and so are the\n  results. Luckily for <i>Starry</i>, the studio behind Once Human, they didn\'t make it so you have you catch Deviants by throwing small spheres at them from a distance. No, you\n<i>  walk </i>up to the Deviant, which is <i>already </i>inside a sphere, and you catch\n  it by holding up your hand, which is <i>entirely </i>different.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not clear on whether the&nbsp; event is a one-way deal, with Pals\n  appearing in Once Human but not the other way around, or whether Deviants will also be popping up in\n  Palworld. Even if it\'s the latter, I doubt very much it would be enough to induce\n  me to go back, even for a visit. Palworld is the open world survival game I\n  liked the least of all the ones I\'ve played, although even then I liked it more\n  than that suggests. It was fun. Just not as much fun as all the others.&nbsp;</p><p></p>\n<p>\n  I also very much doubt a brief return to check out this event will get me to spend much time in Once Human. I seem to be finding it very hard to stick\n  at any games just now. There does seem to be a lot going on in OH,\n  though, what with this, a new scenario and some more Vision Wheel shenanigans, so who\n  knows? With all of that, something might click.\n</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>Another game I\'m eyeing up just now is <i>Erenshor</i>, the solo MMORPG. I\n  played the demo and enjoyed it but I never followed it up. It\'s been in Early Access for a while and\n  there\'s supposed to be a big patch today that changes a whole lot of systems\n  and mechanics so this might be a good time to start.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\nI\'m wondering if I might do better with something like this than with an\nactual MMORPG right now. I\'m assuming Erenshor, unlike an actual MMO, allows you\nto pause or stop at a moment\'s notice, which is one of the main things that puts\nme off playing most of the games I usually enjoy. I\'m wary of starting anything that can\'t be easily interrupted these days.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  What I really should be doing, gaming-wise, is getting back to\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i>, of course. There\'s yet another content drop coming. I could have embedded that video too and the one before but I haven\'t watched either of them for fear of spoilers. I took all that trouble to catch up and the\n  moment I got there, I stopped playing and fell behind again. I should probably\n  prioritize that instead of starting anything new.\n</p>\n<p>That\'s about all I have for today and it\'s more than I thought I had.&nbsp;</p><p>Let\'s finish with a song. Not one of\n  mine. Still pondering how best to present those. Ihave more than a hundred now, which is a problem all of its own.&nbsp;</p><p>How about an old favorite I\'m\n  not sure we\'ve had on the blog before.\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Blurry Moon</i> - Charlotte Gainsbourg</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s <i>Charlotte Gainsbourg</i>\'s first new song since 2018, which predates the\n  appearance of regular music features on <i>IF</i>, explaining why she\'s not\n  appeared here before.

Pals let you do things you couldn\'t\n  otherwise do. Deviants...\n</p>\n<p>\n  You get the idea. The mechanics are really very similar indeed and so are the\n  results. Luckily for <i>Starry</i>, the studio behind Once Human, they didn\'t make it so you have you catch Deviants by throwing small spheres at them from a distance. No, you\n<i>  walk </i>up to the Deviant, which is <i>already </i>inside a sphere, and you catch\n  it by holding up your hand, which is <i>entirely </i>different.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not clear on whether the&nbsp; event is a one-way deal, with Pals\n  appearing in Once Human but not the other way around, or whether Deviants will also be popping up in\n  Palworld. Even if it\'s the latter, I doubt very much it would be enough to induce\n  me to go back, even for a visit. Palworld is the open world survival game I\n  liked the least of all the ones I\'ve played, although even then I liked it more\n  than that suggests. It was fun. Just not as much fun as all the others.&nbsp;</p><p></p>\n<p>\n  I also very much doubt a brief return to check out this event will get me to spend much time in Once Human. I seem to be finding it very hard to stick\n  at any games just now. There does seem to be a lot going on in OH,\n  though, what with this, a new scenario and some more Vision Wheel shenanigans, so who\n  knows? With all of that, something might click.\n</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>Another game I\'m eyeing up just now is <i>Erenshor</i>, the solo MMORPG. I\n  played the demo and enjoyed it but I never followed it up. It\'s been in Early Access for a while and\n  there\'s supposed to be a big patch today that changes a whole lot of systems\n  and mechanics so this might be a good time to start.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\nI\'m wondering if I might do better with something like this than with an\nactual MMORPG right now. I\'m assuming Erenshor, unlike an actual MMO, allows you\nto pause or stop at a moment\'s notice, which is one of the main things that puts\nme off playing most of the games I usually enjoy. I\'m wary of starting anything that can\'t be easily interrupted these days.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  What I really should be doing, gaming-wise, is getting back to\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i>, of course. There\'s yet another content drop coming. I could have embedded that video too and the one before but I haven\'t watched either of them for fear of spoilers. I took all that trouble to catch up and the\n  moment I got there, I stopped playing and fell behind again. I should probably\n  prioritize that instead of starting anything new.\n</p>\n<p>That\'s about all I have for today and it\'s more than I thought I had.&nbsp;</p><p>Let\'s finish with a song. Not one of\n  mine. Still pondering how best to present those.

But it is, apparently. Obviously it\'s been edited but as far as I\ncan tell everything you see is gameplay footage.\n<p></p>\n<p>And so is this, which just landed on <i>YouTube</i>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That\'s ten minutes of "<i>Official Extended Gameplay</i>" that\nabsolutely looks like a movie. Specifically, the center-piece car chase from a\npretty good movie. A movie I would certainly watch.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  My question isn\'t "<i>Is this game going to be any good?</i>" or "<i>Will it be Pay-to-Win</i>?" or any of those obvious things gamers always ask. It\'s not even "<i>Will it run on my aging PC?</i>", although that\'s a valid concern.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, my question is "<i>How the hell is that even possible?</i>" Apart from the\n  oddly stilted walking animations, the video looks like a bunch of clips from a movie.\n  <i>MOP </i>described it as a "<i>sizzle reel</i>" and that\'s really what it\n  is.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  After watching it, I found myself thinking back to something that happened more than thirty years ago, which I\'ve never forgotten. I happened to go into large store in a nearby city and I was walking through\n  the electronics department when I saw, on a large screen (For those days.), a video\n  game playing. It was a castle in a fantasy forest and it looked like just a movie.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never found out what the game was or what it was running on and I can\'t even remember now how I knew it was a game not a film. I\'m pretty\n  sure if I could see it now it would look like something you\'d see in\n  a&nbsp;<i>PS1</i>game. It probably <i>was </i>a PS1 game. It would have been around that time. Whatever it was, it looked like the future. Well, it looked like the past, what with it being a fantasy castle and all, but the past seen through the lens of the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/s1280/anantagirl2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/w640-h448/anantagirl2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Technologically, we are all living in the future now and we take it for granted.\n  Things we pay no attention to or even get anoyed by today would have seemed like literal, actual magic just thirty years ago. If I find it hard to believe something\n  like Ananta can even be real today, imagine how I\'d have felt if I could have watched that trailer\n  in 1995!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Something I hear often these days is that improved graphics can only take the\n  games industry so far and that the limit may already have been reached. And that\'s\n  probably true, as far as it goes. But what\'s hard to believe about this\n  trailer isn\'t so much the visual quality, impressive though it is; it\'s the world-building.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what draws me in to all of these new games, all these new worlds, from\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i> to <i>Neverness To Everness</i> to Ananta: their\n  cinematic, novelistic storytelling. I see clips and I want to know who the\n  characters are, what their lives are like, what they\'re doing. It\'s not new\n  but it <i>seems </i>like it\'s new. It\'s the new future of our long, storytelling past.</p>\n<p>\n  Also, someone\'s bound to be wearing bunny ears in one of these things and that\'s always a\n  bonus. I\'d say you don\'t see <i>that </i>in real life but I saw two people wearing bunny ears in the street only this week...\n</p>\n<p>\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>On MMORPGs And Why They\'re Kinda Done</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  As big, mass-market affairs, that is. Not as small to medium sized niche services\n  servicing small to medium size niches. They\'re still good there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was\n  <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/#comment-330459"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">something <i>Redbeard </i>said</span></a>\n  in response to <i>Wilhelm</i>\'s post about <i>Ship of Heroes</i> yesterday\n  that started me thinking. For some reason, the conversation took a detour\n  into<i> Guild Wars 2 </i>and how a big part of the revenue system there relies\n  on persuading players to part with cash to remove the inconveniences the devs\n  have added in, seemingly for that exact purpose.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a well-known mechanic in many MMOs. The very unpopular version is to put\n  up obvious pay-walls for in-game services and systems most players believe\n  should be part of the core gameplay. <i>Star Wars: the Old Republic</i> used\n  to be the leader in that awkward field, charging money for everything up to\n  and including enough hot bars to fit your skills.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They toned that down over time and recently they\'ve cut it right back to\n  something closer to what players expected in the first place. It still leaves\n  a whole lot of less controversial money-making opportunities in place, though,\n  one of which is always storage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>GW2 </i>has always had a serious storage problem. The game isn\'t overly\n  generous with inventory space to begin with but it does allow you to expand it\n  in various ways, all of which are technically free. As Redbeard points out,\n  though, its much, much easier to get out your credit card and pay.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never did and that\'s because I played GW2 like an old-school MMORPG. I played for a decade, virtually every day, often for several hours at a time. Just playing normally and not spending any real money, I ended up with a huge amount of\n  inventory space across multiple accounts and characters. On my most-played\n  characters I had all the bag and bank slots you were allowed. I hit the point\n  where even real money wouldn\'t have gotten me any more and I hadn\'t paid a\n  dime.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/s307/gw2leg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="367" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/w640-h367/gw2leg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  It still wasn\'t enough. I made bigger bags and <i>that </i>wasn\'t enough. Nothing was\n<i>  ever </i>enough. GW2 doesn\'t just have a storage problem, it has a loot problem.\n  There\'s far, far, far too much of it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is also the key to <i>not </i>spending any money on storage. You have the\n  choice, as Wilhelm suggests, of just throwing everything away. That\'ll fix it\n  for free and right away. Or you can sell all of the good stuff you find and use the\n  gold to buy Gems, the cash shop currency, then use those Gems to buy more\n  storage space, which is what I did.\n</p>\n<p>\n  People complain all the time about not being able to make enough gold in GW2.\n  I made thousands, easily. I still have most of it because I made far more than I ever needed. I didn\'t make any special effort, either. I had\n  just two tricks for making gold:\n</p>\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\n  <li>\n    <b>Never, ever make any Legendaries. Sell all the mats for them you find to to those who do.</b></li>\n  <li><b>Play every hour god sends</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The first isn\'t a problem. It\'s just sensible. No-one needs Legendary items in\n  GW2. They do nothing for gameplay. They\'re convenience items and cosmetics. Let others waste their time and pay you for the privilege.</p>\n<p>\n  The second is the reason MMORPGs are and always will be a niche interest. They absolutely do not respect your time.&nbsp;</p><p>Redbeard has inventory problems he can only, rationally, solve by paying real\n  money because he doesn\'t play GW2 several hours a day, every day, year in, year out. If he did,\n  the problem would solve itself, at least until there were no more slots left to\n  buy with all that gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All MMORPGs are designed to be played for several hours a day, every day,\n  forever. That\'s the business model. The reason the genre is being lapped\n  by open-world RPGs and survival games is that those offer the same level\n  of intensity and immersion that made MMORPGs successful in the first place but they don\'t go on forever and ever and ever like an\n  eternal treadmill. They don\'t necessarily come with a Game Over title card but they\n  have clear end-points that feel like a satisfying place to stop. And they have clear on-ramps every\n  time they add DLC or major updates, meaning you can dip in and out without worrying about falling far behind.</p>\n<p>\n  Or something. It\'s a theory. I haven\'t really thought it through. Feel free to elaborate and iterate on it.</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">AI Ruins Everything</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s made a lot of people happy, I bet. I don\'t mean that it does. I mean that I said it. Do I mean it, though? Depends what you mean by "<i>AI</i>", doesn\'t it?</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Greg Morris</i>, whose blog I picked up in Blaugust, has\n  <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2025/09/24/i-did-it-myself.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a good take</span></a>\n  on it. He, like me, isn\'t existentially opposed to AI. He sees some merits\n  and uses, as do I. He\'s just not very impressed with what people are doing\n  with it just now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  "<i>Widespread usage of generative products, particularly ChatGPT, by many\n    people I come in contact with is making my life more difficult</i>" he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, mine too. All of ours, I bet.\n</p>\n<p>Like Greg, I am not as sanguine as I could be about my doctor\'s surgery\n  moving to an AI triage system. Neither am I convinced that having AI answer\n  the phone when I call to try and buy something is the best way of\n  handling a commercial transaction. Unlike Greg, I\'m happy to say I don\'t\n  encounter AI in my work although no doubt it\'s only a matter of time, but I\n  have very low confidence in any of the current LLMs being able to send emails\n  that wouldn\'t have gotten me into trouble if I\'d written them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What I do think, perhaps over-optimistically, is that the AIs will either\n  have to get a lot better or most of the companies and services that have\n  adopted them so quickly will have to drop them again pretty quickly too, probably\n  as soon as they notice how much money they\'re losing and how many lawsuits\n  they\'re picking up. Those No Win No Fee lawyers must just <i>love </i>AI.</p>\n<p>\n  This is all LLMs, though. They\'re the bad AIs. Generative AI as a whole may be\n  morally and ethically bad but only some of it is practically bad, too.

AI images of a certain\n  kind stimulate the same level of endorphin production or synaptic snap or whatever it is that\n  makes me look at a line drawing and get a warm, tingly feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Doubly so if\n  it\'s one I\'ve caused to be made myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If I was making my living by drawing pictures, that would piss me off. Or\n  maybe it wouldn\'t. Maybe I\'d just see AI as a new kind of pencil and start drawing with it. At the moment, there\'s resistance to commissioned AI art but will\n  that attitude last? In the end, don\'t people mostly want the right image for\n  the purpose they\'ve commissioned it? Is the provenance of the picture that important? And if your primary (Or ancillary.) motivation is to give work to the artist, does that have anything at all to do with aesthetics?</p>\n<p>\n  To some people, yes, obviously. But to the mass market? I doubt it. And I was\n  never going to commission anyone to draw anything anyway so it\'s a moot point\n  as far as my money is concerned.\n</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>\n  The same applies to generative AI and music, another field where I can claim a\n  longstanding interest.

Most of it is horrible. But I suspect that says more about\n  the musical tastes of the people who are making it than the capacity and\n  potential of the AIs. When people who like the kind of music I like start\n  making music with AI, I\'m pretty sure I\'ll find plenty to enjoy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Always assuming I even know, that is. If people don\'t say they used AI, who\'s going to know?&nbsp;</p><p>There are some free apps around that\n  purport to be able to tell if a song has been made by AI or not. I tried a\n  couple. I\'d give you the links but I forgot to bookmark them.</p>\n<p>\n  One is extremely accurate but that one works by analyzing the frequencies of the\n  sample you submit rather than trying to make any aesthetic judgments. It\'s undeniable that AI has a particular sonic signature you can hear once your ear attunes to it and there\'s a technical accuracy to the timing that human musicians don\'t always\n  achieve. I imagine that could be coded out if the people making AI wanted to\n  hide it.&nbsp;</p><p>That app, unsurprisingly, pegged everything I sent it as having been made by AI. Which it was. I should have dummied it with some human music but I was just dicking around, not running some kind of double-blind experiment.</p>\n<p>\n  The other app, which attempts something more along the lines of a critical analysis, looking at things like the structure and the lyrics as well as the music, was much less certain whether an AI was involved or not. It tended to\n  think most of the songs I was sending it were mostly done by a human.&nbsp;</p><p>And so\n  they were. I wrote all the words. I came up with all the melodies. I gave the\n  AI a guide vocal, which I made sure the AI followed very closely. In my opinion, those songs were indeed made by a human. A human using AI as an instrument.</p>\n<p>I suspect most of the AI music being made doesn\'t have that degree of human input behind it, though. An astonishing amount of AI music is being uploaded to streaming sites every\n  day. Millions of songs. Almost all of them made purely by AI from a short prompt.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see why the platforms might want to filter it\n  out.

She\n    shares the house and garden with a girl in her late teens called Cat, a\n    young woman of indefinable age called Cathy and a woman in her early\n    thirties called Rachel. Phoebe has never left the house and garden. She has\n    no memories of ever being anywhere else. She thinks she had a brother but\n    she doesn\'t really remember him. She reads, plays chess with Cat, and just\n    generally gets through the day. She believes Cat and Cathy are ghosts. She\n    believes she\'s a half-ghost. She believes Rachel is fully real. Cat is\n    friendly and kind to her. Cathy is drifty and vague but unafraid of anything\n    and protective of Phoebe. Rachel is often angry because she wants to leave\n    to get back to her friends, about whom she often talks, but she doesn\'t know\n    how to leave. Rachel, when she\'s in a good mood, creates firework displays\n    and makes snow fall so she and Phoebe can build snow statues of Rachel\'s\n    absent friends. One day, after this has been going on for a long time, two\n    of Rachel\'s friends, Sally and Cado Babe, appear in the garden and soon\n    after they and Rachel are gone. Phoebe is left on her own with Cat and\n    Cathy. She wonders now if she, too, will ever leave. </i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The header image and the second one were both done with Google\'s\n  <i>Imagen 4.0</i> at NightCafe.

A movie I would certainly watch.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  My question isn\'t "<i>Is this game going to be any good?</i>" or "<i>Will it be Pay-to-Win</i>?" or any of those obvious things gamers always ask.

I happened to go into large store in a nearby city and I was walking through\n  the electronics department when I saw, on a large screen (For those days.), a video\n  game playing. It was a castle in a fantasy forest and it looked like just a movie.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never found out what the game was or what it was running on and I can\'t even remember now how I knew it was a game not a film. I\'m pretty\n  sure if I could see it now it would look like something you\'d see in\n  a&nbsp;<i>PS1</i>game. It probably <i>was </i>a PS1 game. It would have been around that time. Whatever it was, it looked like the future. Well, it looked like the past, what with it being a fantasy castle and all, but the past seen through the lens of the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/s1280/anantagirl2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/w640-h448/anantagirl2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Technologically, we are all living in the future now and we take it for granted.\n  Things we pay no attention to or even get anoyed by today would have seemed like literal, actual magic just thirty years ago. If I find it hard to believe something\n  like Ananta can even be real today, imagine how I\'d have felt if I could have watched that trailer\n  in 1995!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Something I hear often these days is that improved graphics can only take the\n  games industry so far and that the limit may already have been reached.

But what\'s hard to believe about this\n  trailer isn\'t so much the visual quality, impressive though it is; it\'s the world-building.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what draws me in to all of these new games, all these new worlds, from\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i> to <i>Neverness To Everness</i> to Ananta: their\n  cinematic, novelistic storytelling. I see clips and I want to know who the\n  characters are, what their lives are like, what they\'re doing. It\'s not new\n  but it <i>seems </i>like it\'s new. It\'s the new future of our long, storytelling past.</p>\n<p>\n  Also, someone\'s bound to be wearing bunny ears in one of these things and that\'s always a\n  bonus.

Not as small to medium sized niche services\n  servicing small to medium size niches. They\'re still good there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was\n  <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/#comment-330459"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">something <i>Redbeard </i>said</span></a>\n  in response to <i>Wilhelm</i>\'s post about <i>Ship of Heroes</i> yesterday\n  that started me thinking. For some reason, the conversation took a detour\n  into<i> Guild Wars 2 </i>and how a big part of the revenue system there relies\n  on persuading players to part with cash to remove the inconveniences the devs\n  have added in, seemingly for that exact purpose.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a well-known mechanic in many MMOs. The very unpopular version is to put\n  up obvious pay-walls for in-game services and systems most players believe\n  should be part of the core gameplay. <i>Star Wars: the Old Republic</i> used\n  to be the leader in that awkward field, charging money for everything up to\n  and including enough hot bars to fit your skills.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They toned that down over time and recently they\'ve cut it right back to\n  something closer to what players expected in the first place. It still leaves\n  a whole lot of less controversial money-making opportunities in place, though,\n  one of which is always storage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>GW2 </i>has always had a serious storage problem. The game isn\'t overly\n  generous with inventory space to begin with but it does allow you to expand it\n  in various ways, all of which are technically free. As Redbeard points out,\n  though, its much, much easier to get out your credit card and pay.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never did and that\'s because I played GW2 like an old-school MMORPG. I played for a decade, virtually every day, often for several hours at a time. Just playing normally and not spending any real money, I ended up with a huge amount of\n  inventory space across multiple accounts and characters. On my most-played\n  characters I had all the bag and bank slots you were allowed. I hit the point\n  where even real money wouldn\'t have gotten me any more and I hadn\'t paid a\n  dime.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/s307/gw2leg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="367" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/w640-h367/gw2leg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  It still wasn\'t enough. I made bigger bags and <i>that </i>wasn\'t enough. Nothing was\n<i>  ever </i>enough. GW2 doesn\'t just have a storage problem, it has a loot problem.\n  There\'s far, far, far too much of it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is also the key to <i>not </i>spending any money on storage. You have the\n  choice, as Wilhelm suggests, of just throwing everything away. That\'ll fix it\n  for free and right away. Or you can sell all of the good stuff you find and use the\n  gold to buy Gems, the cash shop currency, then use those Gems to buy more\n  storage space, which is what I did.\n</p>\n<p>\n  People complain all the time about not being able to make enough gold in GW2.\n  I made thousands, easily. I still have most of it because I made far more than I ever needed. I didn\'t make any special effort, either. I had\n  just two tricks for making gold:\n</p>\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\n  <li>\n    <b>Never, ever make any Legendaries. Sell all the mats for them you find to to those who do.</b></li>\n  <li><b>Play every hour god sends</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The first isn\'t a problem. It\'s just sensible. No-one needs Legendary items in\n  GW2. They do nothing for gameplay. They\'re convenience items and cosmetics. Let others waste their time and pay you for the privilege.</p>\n<p>\n  The second is the reason MMORPGs are and always will be a niche interest. They absolutely do not respect your time.&nbsp;</p><p>Redbeard has inventory problems he can only, rationally, solve by paying real\n  money because he doesn\'t play GW2 several hours a day, every day, year in, year out. If he did,\n  the problem would solve itself, at least until there were no more slots left to\n  buy with all that gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All MMORPGs are designed to be played for several hours a day, every day,\n  forever. That\'s the business model. The reason the genre is being lapped\n  by open-world RPGs and survival games is that those offer the same level\n  of intensity and immersion that made MMORPGs successful in the first place but they don\'t go on forever and ever and ever like an\n  eternal treadmill. They don\'t necessarily come with a Game Over title card but they\n  have clear end-points that feel like a satisfying place to stop. And they have clear on-ramps every\n  time they add DLC or major updates, meaning you can dip in and out without worrying about falling far behind.</p>\n<p>\n  Or something. It\'s a theory. I haven\'t really thought it through. Feel free to elaborate and iterate on it.</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">AI Ruins Everything</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s made a lot of people happy, I bet. I don\'t mean that it does. I mean that I said it. Do I mean it, though? Depends what you mean by "<i>AI</i>", doesn\'t it?</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Greg Morris</i>, whose blog I picked up in Blaugust, has\n  <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2025/09/24/i-did-it-myself.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a good take</span></a>\n  on it. He, like me, isn\'t existentially opposed to AI. He sees some merits\n  and uses, as do I. He\'s just not very impressed with what people are doing\n  with it just now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  "<i>Widespread usage of generative products, particularly ChatGPT, by many\n    people I come in contact with is making my life more difficult</i>" he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, mine too. All of ours, I bet.\n</p>\n<p>Like Greg, I am not as sanguine as I could be about my doctor\'s surgery\n  moving to an AI triage system. Neither am I convinced that having AI answer\n  the phone when I call to try and buy something is the best way of\n  handling a commercial transaction. Unlike Greg, I\'m happy to say I don\'t\n  encounter AI in my work although no doubt it\'s only a matter of time, but I\n  have very low confidence in any of the current LLMs being able to send emails\n  that wouldn\'t have gotten me into trouble if I\'d written them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What I do think, perhaps over-optimistically, is that the AIs will either\n  have to get a lot better or most of the companies and services that have\n  adopted them so quickly will have to drop them again pretty quickly too, probably\n  as soon as they notice how much money they\'re losing and how many lawsuits\n  they\'re picking up. Those No Win No Fee lawyers must just <i>love </i>AI.</p>\n<p>\n  This is all LLMs, though. They\'re the bad AIs. Generative AI as a whole may be\n  morally and ethically bad but only some of it is practically bad, too. The real problem with the rest is that it\'s getting to be too\n  good at what it does.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/s512/wtcf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/w640-h640/wtcf1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'ve been a fan of line art since I was a child. I\'ve spent well over half\n  a century developing a fairly well-trained eye and a reasonably informed,\n  historical understanding of line art and illustration, particularly comics. I\n  have a reliably-formatted emotional and aesthetic reaction to every such image I see that allows me to parse it and contextualize it by way of decades of exposure.</p>\n<p>\n  And I like some of the AI images I\'m seeing these days as well as or better than many, many similar\n  pictures I\'ve seen that were drawn by humans. Humans draw a lot of really bad line art and a lot of them don\'t know how bad it is.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn\'t matter if I know an image is by AI, either. It doesn\'t put me off. The image is the image (cf. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/intentional-fallacy"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Intentional Fallacy,</span></a> as always.) It\'s not\n  like I\'m being tricked into thinking a human did it. AI images of a certain\n  kind stimulate the same level of endorphin production or synaptic snap or whatever it is that\n  makes me look at a line drawing and get a warm, tingly feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Doubly so if\n  it\'s one I\'ve caused to be made myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If I was making my living by drawing pictures, that would piss me off. Or\n  maybe it wouldn\'t. Maybe I\'d just see AI as a new kind of pencil and start drawing with it. At the moment, there\'s resistance to commissioned AI art but will\n  that attitude last? In the end, don\'t people mostly want the right image for\n  the purpose they\'ve commissioned it? Is the provenance of the picture that important? And if your primary (Or ancillary.) motivation is to give work to the artist, does that have anything at all to do with aesthetics?</p>\n<p>\n  To some people, yes, obviously. But to the mass market? I doubt it. And I was\n  never going to commission anyone to draw anything anyway so it\'s a moot point\n  as far as my money is concerned.\n</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>\n  The same applies to generative AI and music, another field where I can claim a\n  longstanding interest. Or at least it applies to music <i>I\'ve</i> made with\n  AI, which I currently prefer to listen to over almost anything else.&nbsp;\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/s894/aihg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/w640-h448/aihg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  I have to say that I have yet to hear anything <i>made </i>by anyone else using AI that has\n  the same impact. Most of it is horrible. But I suspect that says more about\n  the musical tastes of the people who are making it than the capacity and\n  potential of the AIs. When people who like the kind of music I like start\n  making music with AI, I\'m pretty sure I\'ll find plenty to enjoy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Always assuming I even know, that is. If people don\'t say they used AI, who\'s going to know?&nbsp;</p><p>There are some free apps around that\n  purport to be able to tell if a song has been made by AI or not. I tried a\n  couple. I\'d give you the links but I forgot to bookmark them.</p>\n<p>\n  One is extremely accurate but that one works by analyzing the frequencies of the\n  sample you submit rather than trying to make any aesthetic judgments. It\'s undeniable that AI has a particular sonic signature you can hear once your ear attunes to it and there\'s a technical accuracy to the timing that human musicians don\'t always\n  achieve. I imagine that could be coded out if the people making AI wanted to\n  hide it.&nbsp;</p><p>That app, unsurprisingly, pegged everything I sent it as having been made by AI. Which it was. I should have dummied it with some human music but I was just dicking around, not running some kind of double-blind experiment.</p>\n<p>\n  The other app, which attempts something more along the lines of a critical analysis, looking at things like the structure and the lyrics as well as the music, was much less certain whether an AI was involved or not. It tended to\n  think most of the songs I was sending it were mostly done by a human.&nbsp;</p><p>And so\n  they were. I wrote all the words. I came up with all the melodies. I gave the\n  AI a guide vocal, which I made sure the AI followed very closely. In my opinion, those songs were indeed made by a human. A human using AI as an instrument.</p>\n<p>I suspect most of the AI music being made doesn\'t have that degree of human input behind it, though. An astonishing amount of AI music is being uploaded to streaming sites every\n  day. Millions of songs. Almost all of them made purely by AI from a short prompt.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see why the platforms might want to filter it\n  out. Except, if their customers are happily listening to it, why would they\n  bother?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Bad pushes out good is the old saw. But what if the bad gets good and the good\n  isn\'t as good as all that?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">If We\'re All Sitting Comfortably...&nbsp;</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgogKlcaPXPAqMT0i2JGUP1AASH0N53klNO2vBjiarVyd_k5Tr2euZ-HMPifU0RQ8z4E0XjhgDEKpA4auyEKffhpJ_Wktf9PlFzHNfXij_15r3CgN9viofVvjpexfcdPsVadvizaEWZOU8EcboNz4vVqVZuFez5NzZKevtaHeEWh6stxo4LC3Zvgxn9c8o/s650/twge1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgogKlcaPXPAqMT0i2JGUP1AASH0N53klNO2vBjiarVyd_k5Tr2euZ-HMPifU0RQ8z4E0XjhgDEKpA4auyEKffhpJ_Wktf9PlFzHNfXij_15r3CgN9viofVvjpexfcdPsVadvizaEWZOU8EcboNz4vVqVZuFez5NzZKevtaHeEWh6stxo4LC3Zvgxn9c8o/w348-h400/twge1.png" width="348" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  <i>Gemini </i>has a new trick.

The full prompt for the whole thing was an\n  ad hoc precis of a whole series of fictional pieces I published in an APA back\n  in the 90s. At some point I will be posting the originals, complete with the\n  infinitely superior full text and collaged illustrations, so if you have any\n  interest, you might want to wait for that:\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;"<i>Please make me a picture book for adults about a girl called Phoebe, aged\n    about 12 or 13, who lives in a rambling old house with a walled garden. She\n    shares the house and garden with a girl in her late teens called Cat, a\n    young woman of indefinable age called Cathy and a woman in her early\n    thirties called Rachel. Phoebe has never left the house and garden. She has\n    no memories of ever being anywhere else. She thinks she had a brother but\n    she doesn\'t really remember him. She reads, plays chess with Cat, and just\n    generally gets through the day. She believes Cat and Cathy are ghosts. She\n    believes she\'s a half-ghost. She believes Rachel is fully real. Cat is\n    friendly and kind to her. Cathy is drifty and vague but unafraid of anything\n    and protective of Phoebe. Rachel is often angry because she wants to leave\n    to get back to her friends, about whom she often talks, but she doesn\'t know\n    how to leave. Rachel, when she\'s in a good mood, creates firework displays\n    and makes snow fall so she and Phoebe can build snow statues of Rachel\'s\n    absent friends. One day, after this has been going on for a long time, two\n    of Rachel\'s friends, Sally and Cado Babe, appear in the garden and soon\n    after they and Rachel are gone. Phoebe is left on her own with Cat and\n    Cathy. She wonders now if she, too, will ever leave. </i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The header image and the second one were both done with Google\'s\n  <i>Imagen 4.0</i> at NightCafe. For some reason, instead of taking a couple of\n  screenshots from the Ananta videos, I thought it would be amusing to have an\n  AI make them instead. The prompt for the top image was "<i>An anime girl dressed in blue with bunny ears riding in an electric blue\n    sports car along a freeway between the towering skyscrapers of a near-future\n    city. Bright sunshine, blue sky.

People\ntake time off work or call in sick just to be part of that launch-day crowd.\nNo-one wants to miss out on an event that might be something people talk\nabout for years.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, there are risks. The servers often buckle under the load. Even when\n  the devs have been diligent with stress testing and allowances have been made\n  for the crush, they always somehow seem to underestimate the demand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if the servers stay up, there are bound to be queues. We\'ve all seen the\n  screenshots - #6,427 in line: estimated waiting time two hours and\n  counting.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  If only there was a way to ensure anyone who wanted to play could get into the\n  game quickly and easily, without having to go through all those hassles...\n</p>\n<p>Guess what? There is! Here\'s how you do it...</p>\n<p>\n  Charge $60 for the (Non-existent.) box <i>and </i>demand&nbsp;fifteen dollars\n  a month to keep on playing after the first thirty days! That ought to do it!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ah, but is it enough? If your game is <i>really </i>good and has fantastic\n  word of mouth and the streamers are all plugging it like crazy and you\'ve\n  picked out a spot in the market where there\'s no direct competition, maybe\n  you\'ll still find yourself overwhelmed by hordes of frantic players throwing\n  money at you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, just to be safe, why not go head-to-head with the free-to-play game that\n  inspired the one you just spent years on? And why not make sure your\n  AAA-priced version of that familiar title looks like "<i>a relic of a bygone era</i>", specifically "<i>the early 00\'s</i>". Make sure it\'s "<i>worse than games released 2 decades ago</i>" and be sure it plays&nbsp;"<i>like a student project or an alpha build with a bunch of placeholders for\n    real icons, graphics, sound effects, systems, and so on</i>".&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not my words, just a few choice quotes from the <i>Steam </i>reviews, where\n  <i>Ship of Heroes</i> (Aww - you guessed...) is currently enjoying a rating of\n  <i>Mostly Negative </i>from forty-eight reviews.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And since everyone really <i>loves </i>AI these days, especially gamers, why\n  not use it instead of actual actors for your NPC voice acting? That last\n  allegation appears to have been disputed by the developers but the general\n  impression is that the voice acting is "<i>awful</i>" no matter whether humans\n  or machines are doing it, so it probably doesn\'t matter much either way.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that in place (And a lot more besides.) it\'s safe to assume your\n  players won\'t run into any of those all-too-familiar launch day issues. Your\n  servers will almost certainly be able to withstand the strain of the teens of\n  people willing to stump up the cost of<i> Baldurs Gate 3 </i>for a chance to\n  play "<i>a buggy mess</i>" for a month before having to get their credit cards\n  out once more for the right to carry on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If nothing else, you\'ll certainly be able to claim you had no queues at launch\n  and everyone was able to log straight in.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/s600/soh4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/w640-h360/soh4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was going to post something more high-minded about all this but\n  <i>Wilhelm </i>got there before me so I took the low road. For a less snarky\n  take on the situation I refer you to\n  <i><a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">TAGN</span></a></i>. I do have a few semi-serious observations of my own to make, though.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1890100/Ship_of_Heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Ship of Heroes</span></a>\n  launched yesterday to a largely disinterested gaming public, most of whom had\n  probably only heard of the game at all thanks to the recent flurry of\n  (Negative.) press interest generated by open disbelief at the price point. If\n  the plan was to raise the game\'s profile then I suppose they achieved it but I\n  suspect they may be learning there is such a thing as bad publicity after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game is available through Steam and only through Steam, so for once we\n  have an MMORPG whose exact population is relatively easy to ascertain.\n  <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1890100/charts/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The numbers are in</span></a>\n  and they are not pretty.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;The "<i>All Time</i>" (By which we mean two days.) peak stands at a tidy\n  100. As I type this, there are sixteen players online.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just for contrast,<i> Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen</i>, which entered Early\n  Access on Steam last December at a box price of $39.99, has an all-time\n  peak of just under 7,000 players with five hundred people playing right now.\n  That sounds like it might be a viable business model. This does not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Then again, who am I to say? I played both games, very briefly, in open\n  testing and decided not to pay much more attention to either of them. I might\n  have been the target market once but that seems a very long time ago now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It would also be ridiculous of me to pretend to be surprised by how the Ship\n  of Heroes launch is going. Apart from that irritating clique that seems to\n  think everything is de facto better the more pointlessly exclusive you make\n  it, there has been universal incomprehension at the business model\n  <i>Heroic Games </i>has chosen. No-one expected it to pay off and it has\n  exceeded even those expectations. Or fallen below them.

People\ntake time off work or call in sick just to be part of that launch-day crowd.\nNo-one wants to miss out on an event that might be something people talk\nabout for years.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, there are risks. The servers often buckle under the load. Even when\n  the devs have been diligent with stress testing and allowances have been made\n  for the crush, they always somehow seem to underestimate the demand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if the servers stay up, there are bound to be queues. We\'ve all seen the\n  screenshots - #6,427 in line: estimated waiting time two hours and\n  counting.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  If only there was a way to ensure anyone who wanted to play could get into the\n  game quickly and easily, without having to go through all those hassles...\n</p>\n<p>Guess what? There is! Here\'s how you do it...</p>\n<p>\n  Charge $60 for the (Non-existent.) box <i>and </i>demand&nbsp;fifteen dollars\n  a month to keep on playing after the first thirty days! That ought to do it!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ah, but is it enough? If your game is <i>really </i>good and has fantastic\n  word of mouth and the streamers are all plugging it like crazy and you\'ve\n  picked out a spot in the market where there\'s no direct competition, maybe\n  you\'ll still find yourself overwhelmed by hordes of frantic players throwing\n  money at you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, just to be safe, why not go head-to-head with the free-to-play game that\n  inspired the one you just spent years on? And why not make sure your\n  AAA-priced version of that familiar title looks like "<i>a relic of a bygone era</i>", specifically "<i>the early 00\'s</i>". Make sure it\'s "<i>worse than games released 2 decades ago</i>" and be sure it plays&nbsp;"<i>like a student project or an alpha build with a bunch of placeholders for\n    real icons, graphics, sound effects, systems, and so on</i>".&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not my words, just a few choice quotes from the <i>Steam </i>reviews, where\n  <i>Ship of Heroes</i> (Aww - you guessed...) is currently enjoying a rating of\n  <i>Mostly Negative </i>from forty-eight reviews.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And since everyone really <i>loves </i>AI these days, especially gamers, why\n  not use it instead of actual actors for your NPC voice acting? That last\n  allegation appears to have been disputed by the developers but the general\n  impression is that the voice acting is "<i>awful</i>" no matter whether humans\n  or machines are doing it, so it probably doesn\'t matter much either way.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that in place (And a lot more besides.) it\'s safe to assume your\n  players won\'t run into any of those all-too-familiar launch day issues. Your\n  servers will almost certainly be able to withstand the strain of the teens of\n  people willing to stump up the cost of<i> Baldurs Gate 3 </i>for a chance to\n  play "<i>a buggy mess</i>" for a month before having to get their credit cards\n  out once more for the right to carry on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If nothing else, you\'ll certainly be able to claim you had no queues at launch\n  and everyone was able to log straight in.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/s600/soh4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/w640-h360/soh4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was going to post something more high-minded about all this but\n  <i>Wilhelm </i>got there before me so I took the low road. For a less snarky\n  take on the situation I refer you to\n  <i><a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">TAGN</span></a></i>. I do have a few semi-serious observations of my own to make, though.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1890100/Ship_of_Heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Ship of Heroes</span></a>\n  launched yesterday to a largely disinterested gaming public, most of whom had\n  probably only heard of the game at all thanks to the recent flurry of\n  (Negative.) press interest generated by open disbelief at the price point. If\n  the plan was to raise the game\'s profile then I suppose they achieved it but I\n  suspect they may be learning there is such a thing as bad publicity after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game is available through Steam and only through Steam, so for once we\n  have an MMORPG whose exact population is relatively easy to ascertain.\n  <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1890100/charts/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The numbers are in</span></a>\n  and they are not pretty.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;The "<i>All Time</i>" (By which we mean two days.) peak stands at a tidy\n  100. As I type this, there are sixteen players online.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just for contrast,<i> Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen</i>, which entered Early\n  Access on Steam last December at a box price of $39.99, has an all-time\n  peak of just under 7,000 players with five hundred people playing right now.\n  That sounds like it might be a viable business model. This does not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Then again, who am I to say? I played both games, very briefly, in open\n  testing and decided not to pay much more attention to either of them. I might\n  have been the target market once but that seems a very long time ago now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It would also be ridiculous of me to pretend to be surprised by how the Ship\n  of Heroes launch is going. Apart from that irritating clique that seems to\n  think everything is de facto better the more pointlessly exclusive you make\n  it, there has been universal incomprehension at the business model\n  <i>Heroic Games </i>has chosen. No-one expected it to pay off and it has\n  exceeded even those expectations. Or fallen below them. However that goes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not even really surprised to hear the game is janky, buggy and crashes a\n  lot, as many reviews on Steam complain.

A hundred and fifty hours\' worth, in fact. That means I must have played Lyrielle for longer than nearly every game on my <i>Steam </i>account - and I still can\'t tell you a damn thing about her!</p><p>I can\'t even remember why she\'s called Lyrielle. Most of my characters are named for some other character in some book I read and this certainly sounds like one of those names but it\'s not ringing any bells at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With <i>Woolhat</i>, on the other hand, I know exactly where the name comes from. He\'s an Iksar Monk and he used to be called <i>Nesmith</i>. Then there was some server merge or other and he ended up with an X on the end of his name so I renamed him Woolhat.&nbsp;</p><p>I imagine most people reading this (People read this stuff?!) don\'t need any further explanation but for the few that may, <i>Mike Nesmith</i> was one of<i> the Monkees</i> and I thought it was clever to name a Monk after a Monkee. I bet no-one else ever thought of that! And his nickname in the TV show was Woolhat. Because he always wore a wool hat. So the renaming was even cleverer!&nbsp;</p><p>(The Monkees were a pop group. They had a TV show in the sixties. Ask your grandparents.)</p><p>Nesmith/Woolhat did get played a little but for the longest time his main function has been as one of my Bazaar traders and bankers. He holds and sells a lot of stuff for other characters. These days, hold it is all he does because I haven\'t set him to trade for years. But he\'s happy enough.</p><p><i>Gladwaller</i>, it will surprise no-one to know, has been boosted. I didn\'t level him to 85. He was played, though, for a while, before that happened. He\'s a Gnome Enchanter and I made him when I fancied playing the class and didn\'t have one to hand. I messed around with him for a bit and got him into the teens or twenties then dropped him, I think because we moved servers.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no clue why I boosted him years later. The idea of jumping in at Level 85 and trying to play an Enchanter, either solo or in a group, is just fatuous. Maybe I wanted a buff-bot. I\'m pretty sure he\'s never left <i>Plane of Knowledge </i>since he drank the potion.</p><p>His name would appear to be <a href="https://salinger.org/characters/gladwaller/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">taken </span></a>from <i>J.D. Salinger</i>, which would make him my most literary of steals. As a massive Salinger fan, I may well have chosen it deliberately because of that, although I don\'t recall doing it. More likely I just had the name in mind from reading some Salinger around the same time.</p><p><i>Cofferstone</i>\'s name probably comes from <i>Frances Hardinge</i>\'s&nbsp; <i>Fly By Night</i> or<i> Twilight Robbery</i>, two excellent novels from which I\'ve borrowed several names for characters in various games. If he seems to have a lot of played hours for a Level 2, that\'s because he\'s my other Bazaar trader. I have one on each of the two accounts I (used to) play regularly. Cofferstone got a lot of use when I was leveling <i>Magmia</i> by doing Overseer missions every day. You can make very good money like that. And I did, for a few months, until all the swapping between accounts to hand the stuff across got on my nerves.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/s1456/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="314" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/w640-h314/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" width="640" /></a></div>And finally we come to <i>Telza</i>, about whom there really is nothing to say. Another boosted character, this time a Shaman. I have never played a Shaman beyond the teens so, like Gladwaller, the idea of starting at 85 is fanciful. Then again, I <i>have </i>played a Beastlord, all the way to 84, and the skill sets are extremely similar, so maybe it\'s not such a crazy idea after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p><p>Still never did it, though. Again, Telza has almost certainly never left <i>PoK</i>.&nbsp; She\'s named for <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telzey_Amberdon">Telzey Amberdon</a></i></span>, lead character in a series of novels by <i>James H. Schmitz</i>, all of which I have now read, although I\'m not sure I had back in 2017, when I created her.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first of the series, which I read in the 1970s, Telzey has an intelligent great cat as a companion, and I\'m fairly sure my original plan was to use one of the free boosts to make a Beastlord, for whom the reference would have been highly appropriate. When the time came, though, I decided against it on the grounds that I already had a perfectly good Beastlord and I went for a Shaman instead, which is a less-good fit for the name.&nbsp;</p><p>And then I never played her and made another Beastlord later and boosted her instead. So much for planning. Should have saved the name.</p><p>As that last sentence suggests, I didn\'t stop making characters after these twenty-five. I did slow down a lot but there are maybe half a dozen more out there, including a few I\'ve actually played, like <i>Shadbaggle </i>(Yet another boosted Necro.), <i>Clatterhorse </i>(Who had a run on one of the TLE servers for a while.), <i>Taffetty </i>and <i>Corella</i>. All of whom I remember more clearly than poor old Lyrielle the Forgotten Druid.</p><p>Will I ever make another? I wouldn\'t bet against it. Every time I write one of these posts I start to feel the old itch.</p><p>For now, though, that\'s it, I think. No more characters to write about. Anniversary celebration complete.</p><p>I do have another idea for a series of ad hoc posts, where I wax nostalgic about the days when I actually played games instead of just wrote about them. Something about&nbsp;<i>EverQuest II</i>, this time.

He\'s a Gnome Enchanter and I made him when I fancied playing the class and didn\'t have one to hand. I messed around with him for a bit and got him into the teens or twenties then dropped him, I think because we moved servers.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no clue why I boosted him years later. The idea of jumping in at Level 85 and trying to play an Enchanter, either solo or in a group, is just fatuous. Maybe I wanted a buff-bot. I\'m pretty sure he\'s never left <i>Plane of Knowledge </i>since he drank the potion.</p><p>His name would appear to be <a href="https://salinger.org/characters/gladwaller/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">taken </span></a>from <i>J.D. Salinger</i>, which would make him my most literary of steals. As a massive Salinger fan, I may well have chosen it deliberately because of that, although I don\'t recall doing it. More likely I just had the name in mind from reading some Salinger around the same time.</p><p><i>Cofferstone</i>\'s name probably comes from <i>Frances Hardinge</i>\'s&nbsp; <i>Fly By Night</i> or<i> Twilight Robbery</i>, two excellent novels from which I\'ve borrowed several names for characters in various games. If he seems to have a lot of played hours for a Level 2, that\'s because he\'s my other Bazaar trader. I have one on each of the two accounts I (used to) play regularly. Cofferstone got a lot of use when I was leveling <i>Magmia</i> by doing Overseer missions every day. You can make very good money like that. And I did, for a few months, until all the swapping between accounts to hand the stuff across got on my nerves.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/s1456/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="314" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/w640-h314/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" width="640" /></a></div>And finally we come to <i>Telza</i>, about whom there really is nothing to say. Another boosted character, this time a Shaman. I have never played a Shaman beyond the teens so, like Gladwaller, the idea of starting at 85 is fanciful. Then again, I <i>have </i>played a Beastlord, all the way to 84, and the skill sets are extremely similar, so maybe it\'s not such a crazy idea after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p><p>Still never did it, though. Again, Telza has almost certainly never left <i>PoK</i>.&nbsp; She\'s named for <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telzey_Amberdon">Telzey Amberdon</a></i></span>, lead character in a series of novels by <i>James H. Schmitz</i>, all of which I have now read, although I\'m not sure I had back in 2017, when I created her.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first of the series, which I read in the 1970s, Telzey has an intelligent great cat as a companion, and I\'m fairly sure my original plan was to use one of the free boosts to make a Beastlord, for whom the reference would have been highly appropriate. When the time came, though, I decided against it on the grounds that I already had a perfectly good Beastlord and I went for a Shaman instead, which is a less-good fit for the name.&nbsp;</p><p>And then I never played her and made another Beastlord later and boosted her instead. So much for planning. Should have saved the name.</p><p>As that last sentence suggests, I didn\'t stop making characters after these twenty-five. I did slow down a lot but there are maybe half a dozen more out there, including a few I\'ve actually played, like <i>Shadbaggle </i>(Yet another boosted Necro.), <i>Clatterhorse </i>(Who had a run on one of the TLE servers for a while.), <i>Taffetty </i>and <i>Corella</i>. All of whom I remember more clearly than poor old Lyrielle the Forgotten Druid.</p><p>Will I ever make another? I wouldn\'t bet against it. Every time I write one of these posts I start to feel the old itch.</p><p>For now, though, that\'s it, I think. No more characters to write about. Anniversary celebration complete.</p><p>I do have another idea for a series of ad hoc posts, where I wax nostalgic about the days when I actually played games instead of just wrote about them. Something about&nbsp;<i>EverQuest II</i>, this time. We\'ll see how that goes...&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-final-five-er-wait-no-theres-six-of.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-final-five-er-wait-no-theres-six-of.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgSPBaiieqkptSPn9wKzYZffSJben34fsF-PTuBeJ_WqdsoVpvIMok1bjVGtxoHf-9y6Q4IoQsd0MxhoatZiE5G8I5gFgY7kyFiFhl7zLHAlVZ4Vg5zx3vKJAgsPlosXuXju66kmyXzvbCVsa3n4RupWhXynwVogQNPlslpY_jM2nqISdNaUHM2dIHDzw/s72-w622-h640-c/eqfinalsix1.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '6'}

The event, which used to be known as\n  <i>Days of Summer</i>, when it started a litle earlier in the year, is a\n  series of weekly quests in <i>EverQuest II</i> that, at least on the face of\n  it, offers a huge boost in power for casual players at the cost of very little\n  effort indeed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At least, that\'s how it appears until you take a closer look at the way it\n  works. I had the opportunity to do just that yesterday, when I went to pick up\n  the first of this year\'s quests and found I hadn\'t finished last year\'s yet.\n  Or started them, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Technically, I <i>had </i>started the 2024 set of nine quests, but only in\n  that I\'d visited <i>Bao Bao</i>, the current Panda-in-Residence, and taken the\n  first one. It was in my Journal but I hadn\'t actually done anything about it\n  in twelve months. Bao Bao was not interested in giving me this year\'s quests\n  until I finished the job I was already on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I had thought you could skip the ones you hadn\'t done. You\'d probably want to\n  if you were a new or returning player because the event has been running since\n  2017, meaning there are now seventy-two quests in the full sequence, not\n  counting the new ones this year. There are a lot of rewards from previous\n  years that still have some currency, not least the huge number of house items,\n  but the main thrust of the event has always been to gear up and who wants a\n  load of outdated armor with inferior stats?\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/The_%22Travels%22_of_Yun_Zi_Timeline">The wiki</a>\n  is somewhat confusing on whether you can skip the years you don\'t want to do:\n  "<i>Each of the quests must be completed in the order they were released,\n    starting with the quests from 2017. You cannot skip ahead to later points in\n    the quest series. </i><b><i>*2023 can be completed without previous progress in this questline.</i>"</b>&nbsp;(Emphasis theirs.) Why 2023 is different from the rest I couldn\'t tell\n  you but it doesn\'t seem to have been the start of a new, more relaxed ruleset\n  because this year\'s starter quest looked to be firmly gated behind completion\n  of last year\'s.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/s1916/eq2lfey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/w640-h302/eq2lfey1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I imagine the reason I thought you could skip was because in 2023 you really\n  could. Maybe I did. I haven\'t checked. I vaguely remember deciding last year\n  that, since I wasn\'t going to use any of the gear, I wouldn\'t bother doing the\n  quests. Or maybe that\'s post hoc rationalization. It\'s entirely possible I\n  just forgot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There were nine quests in the 2024 set. There are nine every year. It takes us\n  through the autumn to the arrival of the annual expansion, one quest dropping\n  every week after the regular update, usually, on a Tuesday. It\'s a pleasant\n  weekly ritual to get the new one, fly around for a few minutes ticking the\n  necessary boxes, then come back to see what new stuff you can grab off the\n  store-panda.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you let yourself fall behind, however, it all feels a bit less amusing.\n  Last night and this morning I did all nine quests. I did it the fastest way\n  possible, using my All Access Membership for instant travel to and from the\n  various zones, moving between the various locations within those zones on my\n  very fast, max-level flying mount and using the detailed walkthrough, complete\n  with copy-and-paste waypoints, from the Wiki.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since I was on my Level 130 Berserker, all mobs in every required zone were\n  grey to me and non-aggressive. All I had to do was port, fly, gather and\n  return. It still took me two hours to finish all nine quests.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The quests themselves were exactly as they always are: gather some samples\n  from various parts of <i>Norrath </i>so some lazy/greedy/cowardly panda can\n  satisfy their curiosity/stuff themselves stupid. Bao Bao is quite an endearing\n  panda as these things go and the quest dialog was amusing enough but the most\n  interesting part to me is how long the dev team can keep the whole thing\n  going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a whole gang of pandas standing around in\n  <i>Sundered Frontier </i>now. I think there are three questgivers and two\n  vendors at least. When the thing started in 2017 there was only\n  <i>Yun Zi </i>handing out the quests and he did his own storekeeping.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/s1920/eq2pandas1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/w640-h360/eq2pandas1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Thanks to the wiki, I had very little trouble finding everything. Almost all\n  of the items were there in profusion. Most of them sparkled and some were\n  oversized. A couple were none of those things but the wiki warned me about\n  that and told me where to look, with accompanying screenshots.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The only part that gave me any real trouble was the quest that asked for some\n  foliage from <i>Lesser Feydark</i>. Lesser Fey is and always has been a total\n  pain to navigate. It has no portals at all accessible via map travel. The best\n  you can do is map to either <i>Butcherblock </i>and take a griffin from the\n  cliffs above the dock or port to <i>Greater Feydark</i> or\n  <i>Steamfont </i>and fly to the zone-in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I went via Butcherblock first, only to find that the BB entrance brings you in\n  on the opposite side of the map to where you want to go. I figured it would be\n  faster to map-travel to GFey and come back in from that side than to fly\n  across the whole of LFey so I did that and it wasn\'t.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d forgotten that you land in <i>Kelethin </i>and Kelethin has its own map\n  and I got myself lost coming out of the dumb elf tree city and ended up\n  wandering about for ages before I finally worked out where I was supposed to\n  be going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once in LFey it wasn\'t much better because the whole place is constructed from\n  a bunch of separate valleys with invisible walls preventing you from flying\n  between them. You have to follow rivers and go through tunnels and you can\'t\n  fly through most of the connections so you have to go on foot. The whole place\n  is a confusing, annoying mess and flying really doesn\'t make it any easier.\n</p>\n<p>So <i>that </i>was fun. I got it done eventually, anyway.</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that out of the way, I was finally able to get the first of this\n  year\'s quests, for which we will be collecting rocks, just for a change. It\n  turns out Bao Bao, who demonstrated his lack of self-control when it comes to\n  stuffing things in his mouth all through the 2024 questline, ate his way\n  through his grandmother\'s entire vegetable garden and now he needs to give her\n  some pretty rocks for her collection to get back on her good side.\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/s911/eq2pandagran2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/w640-h328/eq2pandagran2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\n  Guess who\'ll be doing the hard work lugging those rocks about. Muggins, that\'s\n  who.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And that brings me to the question, once again, of whether it will be worth\n  it. I looked at the first set of rewards, which include a bunch of purple\n  Augments, some weapons and the inevitable bags of decorating items and...\n  that\'s it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Usually there are full sets of armor for all weights and dozens of Augments,\n  along with a few other odds and ends, utilities and so on. I\'m not sure if\n  that means none of those things are going to be on the vendor this time or\n  whether they\'ll only appear week-by-week. And if they aren\'t going to be\n  there, does that mean there\'s going to be a substantial change to the way gear\n  works in the new expansion?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or does it just mean someone has finally admitted that handing out three full\n  sets of gear in three months, each of which upgrades the one before, is taking\n  generosity beyond the bounds of reason? If so, you can bet there will be howls\n  of complaint.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not that the dagger I took <i>does </i>upgrade the best one already available\n  to me, anyway. I took it because it\'s an upgrade for the weapon I was using\n  but I wasn\'t using the best weapon I own. I haven\'t claimed the weapon from\n  the Anniversary crate yet. The panda dagger won\'t upgrade that and if there is\n  panda armor this year and it has the same Resolve as the weapons, that won\'t\n  upgrade the anniversary gear, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, it will be much worse. The Anniversary stuff is 525 Resolve. The new\n  panda weapons are 505.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/s913/eq2pandagran1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/w640-h328/eq2pandagran1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nEven if we discount the Anniversary gear, which you only get for one character\non the account, Resolve 505 isn\'t going to cut it for long. As a casual soloist\nI already have lots of 495 pieces so it\'s a minimal upgrade and it will be\ninstantly rendered redundant the day the expansion arrives. I don\'t know what\nthe <i>Tishan</i>\'s gear will come in at but you can bet it will be at minimum\n505 and come with Augments that work in the new zones, which none of the old\nones will.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Some of that is speculation. This is, or should be, a level cap increase year.\n  Those are usually when things change the most so anything could happen when\n  the expansion arrives. As must be plain from everything I ever write about\n  EQII, the game is ferociously over-complicated, especially when it comes to\n  gear and stats. The team have been trying to strip away some of the accrued\n  cruft for a while now but every time they remove anything there\'s an outcry,\n  not least from the crew that claims to play EQII specifically\n  <i>because </i>it\'s complicated and difficult to understand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ll be doing the panda quests anyway. They\'re a fun little diversion and\n  don\'t take too long (Lesser Feydark always excepted.) and they unlock the\n  vendors for the whole account so it\'s a useful option for some of my\n  sub-max-level characters. Most of all, though, I don\'t want to fall behind\n  again.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Who knows, next year the pandas might come up with something different.

I had the opportunity to do just that yesterday, when I went to pick up\n  the first of this year\'s quests and found I hadn\'t finished last year\'s yet.\n  Or started them, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Technically, I <i>had </i>started the 2024 set of nine quests, but only in\n  that I\'d visited <i>Bao Bao</i>, the current Panda-in-Residence, and taken the\n  first one. It was in my Journal but I hadn\'t actually done anything about it\n  in twelve months. Bao Bao was not interested in giving me this year\'s quests\n  until I finished the job I was already on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I had thought you could skip the ones you hadn\'t done. You\'d probably want to\n  if you were a new or returning player because the event has been running since\n  2017, meaning there are now seventy-two quests in the full sequence, not\n  counting the new ones this year. There are a lot of rewards from previous\n  years that still have some currency, not least the huge number of house items,\n  but the main thrust of the event has always been to gear up and who wants a\n  load of outdated armor with inferior stats?\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/The_%22Travels%22_of_Yun_Zi_Timeline">The wiki</a>\n  is somewhat confusing on whether you can skip the years you don\'t want to do:\n  "<i>Each of the quests must be completed in the order they were released,\n    starting with the quests from 2017. You cannot skip ahead to later points in\n    the quest series. </i><b><i>*2023 can be completed without previous progress in this questline.</i>"</b>&nbsp;(Emphasis theirs.) Why 2023 is different from the rest I couldn\'t tell\n  you but it doesn\'t seem to have been the start of a new, more relaxed ruleset\n  because this year\'s starter quest looked to be firmly gated behind completion\n  of last year\'s.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/s1916/eq2lfey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/w640-h302/eq2lfey1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I imagine the reason I thought you could skip was because in 2023 you really\n  could. Maybe I did. I haven\'t checked. I vaguely remember deciding last year\n  that, since I wasn\'t going to use any of the gear, I wouldn\'t bother doing the\n  quests. Or maybe that\'s post hoc rationalization. It\'s entirely possible I\n  just forgot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There were nine quests in the 2024 set. There are nine every year. It takes us\n  through the autumn to the arrival of the annual expansion, one quest dropping\n  every week after the regular update, usually, on a Tuesday. It\'s a pleasant\n  weekly ritual to get the new one, fly around for a few minutes ticking the\n  necessary boxes, then come back to see what new stuff you can grab off the\n  store-panda.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you let yourself fall behind, however, it all feels a bit less amusing.\n  Last night and this morning I did all nine quests. I did it the fastest way\n  possible, using my All Access Membership for instant travel to and from the\n  various zones, moving between the various locations within those zones on my\n  very fast, max-level flying mount and using the detailed walkthrough, complete\n  with copy-and-paste waypoints, from the Wiki.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since I was on my Level 130 Berserker, all mobs in every required zone were\n  grey to me and non-aggressive. All I had to do was port, fly, gather and\n  return. It still took me two hours to finish all nine quests.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The quests themselves were exactly as they always are: gather some samples\n  from various parts of <i>Norrath </i>so some lazy/greedy/cowardly panda can\n  satisfy their curiosity/stuff themselves stupid. Bao Bao is quite an endearing\n  panda as these things go and the quest dialog was amusing enough but the most\n  interesting part to me is how long the dev team can keep the whole thing\n  going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a whole gang of pandas standing around in\n  <i>Sundered Frontier </i>now. I think there are three questgivers and two\n  vendors at least. When the thing started in 2017 there was only\n  <i>Yun Zi </i>handing out the quests and he did his own storekeeping.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/s1920/eq2pandas1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/w640-h360/eq2pandas1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Thanks to the wiki, I had very little trouble finding everything. Almost all\n  of the items were there in profusion. Most of them sparkled and some were\n  oversized. A couple were none of those things but the wiki warned me about\n  that and told me where to look, with accompanying screenshots.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The only part that gave me any real trouble was the quest that asked for some\n  foliage from <i>Lesser Feydark</i>. Lesser Fey is and always has been a total\n  pain to navigate. It has no portals at all accessible via map travel. The best\n  you can do is map to either <i>Butcherblock </i>and take a griffin from the\n  cliffs above the dock or port to <i>Greater Feydark</i> or\n  <i>Steamfont </i>and fly to the zone-in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I went via Butcherblock first, only to find that the BB entrance brings you in\n  on the opposite side of the map to where you want to go. I figured it would be\n  faster to map-travel to GFey and come back in from that side than to fly\n  across the whole of LFey so I did that and it wasn\'t.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d forgotten that you land in <i>Kelethin </i>and Kelethin has its own map\n  and I got myself lost coming out of the dumb elf tree city and ended up\n  wandering about for ages before I finally worked out where I was supposed to\n  be going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once in LFey it wasn\'t much better because the whole place is constructed from\n  a bunch of separate valleys with invisible walls preventing you from flying\n  between them. You have to follow rivers and go through tunnels and you can\'t\n  fly through most of the connections so you have to go on foot. The whole place\n  is a confusing, annoying mess and flying really doesn\'t make it any easier.\n</p>\n<p>So <i>that </i>was fun. I got it done eventually, anyway.</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that out of the way, I was finally able to get the first of this\n  year\'s quests, for which we will be collecting rocks, just for a change. It\n  turns out Bao Bao, who demonstrated his lack of self-control when it comes to\n  stuffing things in his mouth all through the 2024 questline, ate his way\n  through his grandmother\'s entire vegetable garden and now he needs to give her\n  some pretty rocks for her collection to get back on her good side.\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/s911/eq2pandagran2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/w640-h328/eq2pandagran2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\n  Guess who\'ll be doing the hard work lugging those rocks about. Muggins, that\'s\n  who.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And that brings me to the question, once again, of whether it will be worth\n  it. I looked at the first set of rewards, which include a bunch of purple\n  Augments, some weapons and the inevitable bags of decorating items and...\n  that\'s it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Usually there are full sets of armor for all weights and dozens of Augments,\n  along with a few other odds and ends, utilities and so on. I\'m not sure if\n  that means none of those things are going to be on the vendor this time or\n  whether they\'ll only appear week-by-week. And if they aren\'t going to be\n  there, does that mean there\'s going to be a substantial change to the way gear\n  works in the new expansion?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or does it just mean someone has finally admitted that handing out three full\n  sets of gear in three months, each of which upgrades the one before, is taking\n  generosity beyond the bounds of reason? If so, you can bet there will be howls\n  of complaint.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not that the dagger I took <i>does </i>upgrade the best one already available\n  to me, anyway. I took it because it\'s an upgrade for the weapon I was using\n  but I wasn\'t using the best weapon I own. I haven\'t claimed the weapon from\n  the Anniversary crate yet. The panda dagger won\'t upgrade that and if there is\n  panda armor this year and it has the same Resolve as the weapons, that won\'t\n  upgrade the anniversary gear, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, it will be much worse. The Anniversary stuff is 525 Resolve. The new\n  panda weapons are 505.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/s913/eq2pandagran1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/w640-h328/eq2pandagran1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nEven if we discount the Anniversary gear, which you only get for one character\non the account, Resolve 505 isn\'t going to cut it for long. As a casual soloist\nI already have lots of 495 pieces so it\'s a minimal upgrade and it will be\ninstantly rendered redundant the day the expansion arrives. I don\'t know what\nthe <i>Tishan</i>\'s gear will come in at but you can bet it will be at minimum\n505 and come with Augments that work in the new zones, which none of the old\nones will.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Some of that is speculation. This is, or should be, a level cap increase year.\n  Those are usually when things change the most so anything could happen when\n  the expansion arrives. As must be plain from everything I ever write about\n  EQII, the game is ferociously over-complicated, especially when it comes to\n  gear and stats. The team have been trying to strip away some of the accrued\n  cruft for a while now but every time they remove anything there\'s an outcry,\n  not least from the crew that claims to play EQII specifically\n  <i>because </i>it\'s complicated and difficult to understand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ll be doing the panda quests anyway. They\'re a fun little diversion and\n  don\'t take too long (Lesser Feydark always excepted.) and they unlock the\n  vendors for the whole account so it\'s a useful option for some of my\n  sub-max-level characters. Most of all, though, I don\'t want to fall behind\n  again.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Who knows, next year the pandas might come up with something different. If\n  they do, it\'d be nice to be able to grab it right away instead of playing\n  catch-up first.\n</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/have-you-done-that-little-job-i-gave.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/have-you-done-that-little-job-i-gave.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6VjUXTrxwVUVem4fP0CEGklW0ZKxvm_t77N3cqKlewPWTfDONQHEqczqtUHkKf8tAMeSqhMJlyL6g8qSIcnrF95DLHvGe4opHCZFBXvkSk-YXgPzpbigLUF7XC5Q-5Ku8k_xBfwuEkRbOGuWuEhn2Aa95jhOcc_gAbAtxGQzq9nEj_lP_6nfZBx5Y7BM/s72-w640-h360-c/eq2ppp1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '6'}

That may be because pretty much all I <i>have </i>been listening to for months\n  is the music I\'ve been making myself with <i>Suno</i>.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I listen to my own songs every day.

I guess that\'s what\n  married life does for you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When I can tear myself away from the mirror, I have at least been keeping up\n  with some new music, here and there. It\'s all a little sporadic and random\n  and I haven\'t been doing a lot of trawling for tunes on my own, mostly relying\n  on news feeds to pop me hints, but I have collected a few good picks for the\n  post I\'m about to write.

Some of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  My late-blooming songwriting is very, very different from the stuff I was\n  doing back in the eighties.

What I\'m less sure about is whether that\'s a direct consequence\n  of my method, re-purposing prose, or if it\'s that I\'ve developed a different ear, listening to a lot of contemporary\n  artists. If I was one of those old guys who only ever listens to stuff they\n  liked when they were young, would everything I\'m doing now sound like it did\n  when I was doing it forty years ago?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I guess I don\'t need to care.

That may be because pretty much all I <i>have </i>been listening to for months\n  is the music I\'ve been making myself with <i>Suno</i>.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I listen to my own songs every day. On the desktop, on the laptop, in the car,\n  at work.

I guess that\'s what\n  married life does for you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When I can tear myself away from the mirror, I have at least been keeping up\n  with some new music, here and there. It\'s all a little sporadic and random\n  and I haven\'t been doing a lot of trawling for tunes on my own, mostly relying\n  on news feeds to pop me hints, but I have collected a few good picks for the\n  post I\'m about to write. Am writing. Have written, as I do the final edit.</p>\n<p>\n  Where to start? Something fast and loud is usually indicated to get the party started.

I ran through the first several quests last night and those were more substantial than usual. They took a while and involved some travel and some combat that was easy but not a complete walkover, thanks to mostly taking place in endgame zones, where I had a lot more trouble from random, wandering mobs than the ones I was there to kill.&nbsp;(There are also tradeskill quests for the non-combattants among us. I took those but haven\'t done them yet.)<p></p><p>&nbsp;I can immediately see the similarity between 2025 and 2018 - it\'s another bunch of rifts that spawn waves of mobs you have to dispatch before firing up your doohickey and closing the portal. I did that the required number of times to progress the quests, along with a few other menial tasks, acquiring a bunch of event tokens along the way. Who takes those and what they give you for them I do not yet know.</p><p>I also don\'t know where the next questgivers are, the ones that hand out what I\'m guessing are the repeatable quests. The event neatly sends you to whatever the highest-available open world zones for your character level might be, so in my case the NPCs will be somewhere in the two endgame open world zones, <i>Sodden Archipelago</i> and <i>Western Wastes</i>, but I couldn\'t find them and it was getting late so I decided to wait until someone posts their exact locations on the wiki or, better yet, adds the POIs to <i>EQ2Maps</i>.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsDi3SEEgwjo8rj6-wlLhpWiSHBhZg4BnBGwsFAevNgfwZYij9hKBmEmYjDvnZuWD-jNkDRi0rpRlOI7djFufse4f4OviulkqY3IkQU_xs1pNrrdsukSmNzYhzQyjQPBmUYhSL2_yXiBHikyCNYSpOCS-IPYjQjBp8ab9M4o_H3GO_rmfhnoCV6lV3m2k/s927/eq2rift4.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="268" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsDi3SEEgwjo8rj6-wlLhpWiSHBhZg4BnBGwsFAevNgfwZYij9hKBmEmYjDvnZuWD-jNkDRi0rpRlOI7djFufse4f4OviulkqY3IkQU_xs1pNrrdsukSmNzYhzQyjQPBmUYhSL2_yXiBHikyCNYSpOCS-IPYjQjBp8ab9M4o_H3GO_rmfhnoCV6lV3m2k/w640-h268/eq2rift4.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I can say that the rifts I\'ve had to close so far are not random. They appear in the same spots and have a fairly short cooldown, of the order of five or ten minutes I\'d guess, meaning you can just pick one and stay there as long as you need. Or you can fly around like a dumb-ass like I did, looking for new ones, until you finally realize you just keep coming back to the same two.</p><p>At max level, I\'d recommend the ones in Western Wastes for the simple reason that zone is much less cluttered with foliage, as the name suggests. A lot of it is flat ice floes, which makes spotting the rifts as you fly around much easier. Sodden Archipelago is a jungle and a bunch of ravines, so not ideal for aerial reconnaissance.</p><p>The storyline is interesting. Well, it is if you play EQII. Not, I imagine, for anyone else. The rifts are planar but don\'t appear to come from (Or, presumably, go to...) any planes we already know. The creatures coming out of them are vaguely elemental but of that odd order of elements that includes things like fog and mist. Dragon magic seems to be involved but there\'s no obvious draconic connection.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhejPCijAAUKjPRhBepwiUMXUNp8PTjCB8dAuRt_7gGCRcLgZkDTkEcWPUIRa6FsmSsgv7H3DJ0obZeumRK9aXobf-ubcpiyzoE0qEfbCW4tXkhT-L4_nsmlB-co-Qo7kXngIWnVVknnOBqWjdIeDaurW-6Sjl5mWUjcY8GYnlVfv0Rb7bvcP966wvnFqI/s964/eq2rift3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="246" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhejPCijAAUKjPRhBepwiUMXUNp8PTjCB8dAuRt_7gGCRcLgZkDTkEcWPUIRa6FsmSsgv7H3DJ0obZeumRK9aXobf-ubcpiyzoE0qEfbCW4tXkhT-L4_nsmlB-co-Qo7kXngIWnVVknnOBqWjdIeDaurW-6Sjl5mWUjcY8GYnlVfv0Rb7bvcP966wvnFqI/w640-h246/eq2rift3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>At one point a treant of some sort turns up and starts throwing threats and accusations about.

It made me wonder what the expansion might involve and where we might be headed, which is clearly the main point of an expansion prequel, so job done there, I\'d say. I\'ll definitely follow the questline to the point when it becomes certain there\'s nothing more but repeatables for token or faction left. I might be at that point alread or I might not.</p><p>After that, I guess it depends how much fun closing the rifts is and how good the rewards are.

I can remember a couple that kept me occupied for weeks, putting several characters through them for the experience or the loot.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixOS4UO3YKFYyCxIwAfU3aO2Ynl5hZNVfpNk9-QLq5AZCgaovcDTfK_pIqTJ_3nfYHwzqRt9Uyre1zO8VGElctDEai7tt02_Eb9_79ocseW0jLKqM0DI1htSXrxpXa9YT_qrTQvj0lE9kUAVAfumheU2VZO3jzLw3iDEGN1VV9CYmVjA8Xwgpo8LS9gS0/s1920/eq2rift5.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixOS4UO3YKFYyCxIwAfU3aO2Ynl5hZNVfpNk9-QLq5AZCgaovcDTfK_pIqTJ_3nfYHwzqRt9Uyre1zO8VGElctDEai7tt02_Eb9_79ocseW0jLKqM0DI1htSXrxpXa9YT_qrTQvj0lE9kUAVAfumheU2VZO3jzLw3iDEGN1VV9CYmVjA8Xwgpo8LS9gS0/w640-h360/eq2rift5.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Mostly though, and especially recently, they\'ve been a bit thin. Usually a very quick quest to introduce us to the next, previously unheard-of, Norrathian secret society and a bunch of repeatable quests so we can ingratiate ourselves with them for no very obvious reason. There seem to be an unlimited number of these groups, most of them self-appointed guardians of something or other, roaming around the world like a bunch of Boy Scouts looking for old ladies to help across the street or planar incursions to repel.</p><p>This yeare\'s bunch are called <i>The Flamebearers</i> and they differ from the usual run of do-gooders by being associated with <i>Lady Najena</i>, who I could have sworn was a Medium-Sized Bad last time I met her. She\'s organizing this year\'s bunfight all the same so maybe it\'s one of those enemy-of-my-enemy things or perhaps she\'s had a bang on the head. I imagine we\'ll meet her at some point and she\'ll monologue all about it.</p><p><i>Angeliana </i>on the forums <a href="https://forums.everquest2.com/index.php?threads/introducing-the-heralds-of-oblivion.10120/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">claims </span></a>"<span style="font-size: 15px;"><i>Heralds of Oblivion is shaping up to be \nthe biggest prelude event to rock Norrath since 2018’s Against the \nElements event that preceded Chaos Descending.</i>" If I could remember what that one was like I might be able to benchmark against it.

I ran through the first several quests last night and those were more substantial than usual. They took a while and involved some travel and some combat that was easy but not a complete walkover, thanks to mostly taking place in endgame zones, where I had a lot more trouble from random, wandering mobs than the ones I was there to kill.&nbsp;(There are also tradeskill quests for the non-combattants among us. I took those but haven\'t done them yet.)<p></p><p>&nbsp;I can immediately see the similarity between 2025 and 2018 - it\'s another bunch of rifts that spawn waves of mobs you have to dispatch before firing up your doohickey and closing the portal. I did that the required number of times to progress the quests, along with a few other menial tasks, acquiring a bunch of event tokens along the way. Who takes those and what they give you for them I do not yet know.</p><p>I also don\'t know where the next questgivers are, the ones that hand out what I\'m guessing are the repeatable quests. The event neatly sends you to whatever the highest-available open world zones for your character level might be, so in my case the NPCs will be somewhere in the two endgame open world zones, <i>Sodden Archipelago</i> and <i>Western Wastes</i>, but I couldn\'t find them and it was getting late so I decided to wait until someone posts their exact locations on the wiki or, better yet, adds the POIs to <i>EQ2Maps</i>.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsDi3SEEgwjo8rj6-wlLhpWiSHBhZg4BnBGwsFAevNgfwZYij9hKBmEmYjDvnZuWD-jNkDRi0rpRlOI7djFufse4f4OviulkqY3IkQU_xs1pNrrdsukSmNzYhzQyjQPBmUYhSL2_yXiBHikyCNYSpOCS-IPYjQjBp8ab9M4o_H3GO_rmfhnoCV6lV3m2k/s927/eq2rift4.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="268" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsDi3SEEgwjo8rj6-wlLhpWiSHBhZg4BnBGwsFAevNgfwZYij9hKBmEmYjDvnZuWD-jNkDRi0rpRlOI7djFufse4f4OviulkqY3IkQU_xs1pNrrdsukSmNzYhzQyjQPBmUYhSL2_yXiBHikyCNYSpOCS-IPYjQjBp8ab9M4o_H3GO_rmfhnoCV6lV3m2k/w640-h268/eq2rift4.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I can say that the rifts I\'ve had to close so far are not random. They appear in the same spots and have a fairly short cooldown, of the order of five or ten minutes I\'d guess, meaning you can just pick one and stay there as long as you need. Or you can fly around like a dumb-ass like I did, looking for new ones, until you finally realize you just keep coming back to the same two.</p><p>At max level, I\'d recommend the ones in Western Wastes for the simple reason that zone is much less cluttered with foliage, as the name suggests. A lot of it is flat ice floes, which makes spotting the rifts as you fly around much easier. Sodden Archipelago is a jungle and a bunch of ravines, so not ideal for aerial reconnaissance.</p><p>The storyline is interesting. Well, it is if you play EQII. Not, I imagine, for anyone else. The rifts are planar but don\'t appear to come from (Or, presumably, go to...) any planes we already know. The creatures coming out of them are vaguely elemental but of that odd order of elements that includes things like fog and mist. Dragon magic seems to be involved but there\'s no obvious draconic connection.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhejPCijAAUKjPRhBepwiUMXUNp8PTjCB8dAuRt_7gGCRcLgZkDTkEcWPUIRa6FsmSsgv7H3DJ0obZeumRK9aXobf-ubcpiyzoE0qEfbCW4tXkhT-L4_nsmlB-co-Qo7kXngIWnVVknnOBqWjdIeDaurW-6Sjl5mWUjcY8GYnlVfv0Rb7bvcP966wvnFqI/s964/eq2rift3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="246" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhejPCijAAUKjPRhBepwiUMXUNp8PTjCB8dAuRt_7gGCRcLgZkDTkEcWPUIRa6FsmSsgv7H3DJ0obZeumRK9aXobf-ubcpiyzoE0qEfbCW4tXkhT-L4_nsmlB-co-Qo7kXngIWnVVknnOBqWjdIeDaurW-6Sjl5mWUjcY8GYnlVfv0Rb7bvcP966wvnFqI/w640-h246/eq2rift3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>At one point a treant of some sort turns up and starts throwing threats and accusations about. Everyone denies having any intent to invade the plane of wood or wherever the hell the thing comes from but it pays no attention and keeps on ranting.&nbsp;</p><p>I have to say I was intrigued. It made me wonder what the expansion might involve and where we might be headed, which is clearly the main point of an expansion prequel, so job done there, I\'d say. I\'ll definitely follow the questline to the point when it becomes certain there\'s nothing more but repeatables for token or faction left. I might be at that point alread or I might not.</p><p>After that, I guess it depends how much fun closing the rifts is and how good the rewards are. I\'ll get back to you when I know more.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, though, a very solid start to this year\'s expansion cycle.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/out-of-fog-they-came.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/out-of-fog-they-came.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWAJNjEbzqbbv-JvD4bzOwNpbtE0-4QCg0hU1BiMaDhnFPmVC2wDFd-oDGi1CMzv3r-bdTJS50aRWPBbWsUxy8k9GN5q1GE2g1snNKt9ZAR3fK5zfsB-5c2TxirjryndcWFCmuazzPfYHlWQRxnVZQ7iQdy14ygz0nZheAa-gUOYqtJXA4rk7nVqVwWzE/s72-w640-h360-c/eq2rift1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

Also a microwave, which we didn\'t even notice until we were just about to leave. As well as no mains electricity, there\'s no mains water.&nbsp;</p><p>So what comes out of the taps, then? Air? No, water, but not from the regular supply. It comes from an underground reservoir of undetermined (By me...) provenance. There\'s a warning that it\'s not suitable to drink neat from the tap but that\'s immediately undercut by a further note that all the locals use the same supply and <i>they </i>drink it, the implication clearly being "<i>so, are you going to be a wuss about it?</i>")</p><p>We drank it. Although only in tea and coffee, so it was boiled first. Also we cooked with it. Boiled again, though. Beryl drank it neat but then she drinks out of muddy puddles. Actually, she deliberately stirs up the mud in clean puddles with her paw so as to make them muddy and <i>then </i>she drinks out of them. I\'ve seen her do it.</p><p>Beryl absolutely loved the bus. She acted like it was her new home from the moment we got there and settled down faster than I\'ve seen her settle anywhere new. She\'s crazy for stairs and steps so she was up and down the very steep staircase all the time. (That\'s another thing you might want to bear in mind if you have mobility issues - the spiral staircase is not for the wobbly of limb.)</p><p>The view was fantastic, provided you like a view that resembles a still photograph. Seriously, you could stare out the window for ten minutes at a stretch and never see movement. If it wasn\'t for the odd bird flying by you could make that ten hours.</p><p>Beryl, as you can see, took the opportunity to practice her zen mastery. She stared happily out the window at nothing for ages. Of course, dogs can smell things three miles away, so I imagine there was a rich scent vista to keep her occupied.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDGAi149WqNOjuZPK4RrDiI6eC3t_myXMBT2-XcfKeX7uaN0cEIrrhf0Kzf_uMjD5qQRHW36ewSXq5SFGz7GEzBMIZJ9D0OlqDmWLdj1F9L6Dzh5EEpnwxkThi5NnBfAsFfmjSeLOC8ydtTdunETnPmqW0woscbUOIbEuVsb41_DVO7yKiC9O_61lEWLA/s4080/busberyl2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDGAi149WqNOjuZPK4RrDiI6eC3t_myXMBT2-XcfKeX7uaN0cEIrrhf0Kzf_uMjD5qQRHW36ewSXq5SFGz7GEzBMIZJ9D0OlqDmWLdj1F9L6Dzh5EEpnwxkThi5NnBfAsFfmjSeLOC8ydtTdunETnPmqW0woscbUOIbEuVsb41_DVO7yKiC9O_61lEWLA/w640-h480/busberyl2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Outside, apart from endless, empty fields, there\'s a completely self-contained patio with seats, tables, barbecue equipment and a separate shower unit. We had the bus door open all the time and Beryl could go out safely and potter about with no danger of her wandering off. Not that she would. She doesn\'t like to be more than a few yards away from one or other of us if she can possibly avoid it.</p><p>We did some driving around the local area, which is all farmland, villages and very small market towns. It\'s close to moorland but we didn\'t go onto the moors this time. We did go to a reservoir with the amusing name of <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://www.swlakestrust.org.uk/wimbleball-lake"><i>Wimbleball Lak</i>e</a></span>, though. It was very low after the long, dry summer but the nature reserve around it was great for walking on a sunny, late summer day (Or early autumn, depending how you\'re counting.)</p><p>And that is our holiday for the year. Since we got Beryl we don\'t go far or for long. Maybe one day we\'ll get her inoculated and dog-passported and take her somewhere exotic. Like France. Or even Northern Spain. I think that would be about her limit. She\'s a great traveler and she loves new places but she doesn\'t do well with heat. Perhaps we should go north instead of south...</p><p>We\'re here for now and the foreseeable, though, so normal blogging service may be resumed. Or it may not because I have to figure out a new schedule involving driving over to see my mother three or four times a week instead of once a month as I have done since... well, always.&nbsp;</p><p>Also I have to buy a car to do the driving in. We\'ve always managed with one between us up to now.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which means, if there are unusual gaps in continuity here, that\'s probably why. Although I don\'t really expect it will make that much difference. I can knock these things out a lot faster than I usually do, if I have to.&nbsp;</p><p>Like this one, for example...&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhaJINPAm6KrpKJ6PLXi8Utjz7B_1l4kPa09z7EV2ItuQFb9yuUV51cmCP3o0nYcn2REexw4KeUCqenkZWodMUGdBu298t1kJ6H2RopIzUgYwnyUldnDNetBzXyZJeCb_Wc3dss2jbfwb14BpLWo9JOOMJ9BSZCTTqSMHrBXxAfE69-9VkBIjYMpUOuOs/s4080/berylbus1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhaJINPAm6KrpKJ6PLXi8Utjz7B_1l4kPa09z7EV2ItuQFb9yuUV51cmCP3o0nYcn2REexw4KeUCqenkZWodMUGdBu298t1kJ6H2RopIzUgYwnyUldnDNetBzXyZJeCb_Wc3dss2jbfwb14BpLWo9JOOMJ9BSZCTTqSMHrBXxAfE69-9VkBIjYMpUOuOs/w640-h480/berylbus1.jpg" width="640" /></a>That didn\'t take long!

We had plenty of power to keep the lights on at night and charge our phones and my laptop so what else do you need?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7G2KHmv_0bOuYwABBzZ1qDUHIIafZjg1j-J9vdkegKqxJF5rB2_aNDKzvD6EJkWORv5x-taPXdrj3KEsyimYtJQWMZEd61Ax_eSOdehhYziYA0jFZRK_gfWbxOB36UoyDiDJ6Xpf_BdKVyZVR9A6gF2Nc9hySAvzgSE8XdjfFX_a01ddXdpolONsWF4g/s4080/busberylfeet1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7G2KHmv_0bOuYwABBzZ1qDUHIIafZjg1j-J9vdkegKqxJF5rB2_aNDKzvD6EJkWORv5x-taPXdrj3KEsyimYtJQWMZEd61Ax_eSOdehhYziYA0jFZRK_gfWbxOB36UoyDiDJ6Xpf_BdKVyZVR9A6gF2Nc9hySAvzgSE8XdjfFX_a01ddXdpolONsWF4g/w640-h480/busberylfeet1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>There\'s a wood-burning stove, which we didn\'t use, and a gas cooker (Bottled gas.) which we did. Also a microwave, which we didn\'t even notice until we were just about to leave. As well as no mains electricity, there\'s no mains water.&nbsp;</p><p>So what comes out of the taps, then? Air? No, water, but not from the regular supply. It comes from an underground reservoir of undetermined (By me...) provenance. There\'s a warning that it\'s not suitable to drink neat from the tap but that\'s immediately undercut by a further note that all the locals use the same supply and <i>they </i>drink it, the implication clearly being "<i>so, are you going to be a wuss about it?</i>")</p><p>We drank it. Although only in tea and coffee, so it was boiled first. Also we cooked with it. Boiled again, though. Beryl drank it neat but then she drinks out of muddy puddles. Actually, she deliberately stirs up the mud in clean puddles with her paw so as to make them muddy and <i>then </i>she drinks out of them. I\'ve seen her do it.</p><p>Beryl absolutely loved the bus. She acted like it was her new home from the moment we got there and settled down faster than I\'ve seen her settle anywhere new. She\'s crazy for stairs and steps so she was up and down the very steep staircase all the time. (That\'s another thing you might want to bear in mind if you have mobility issues - the spiral staircase is not for the wobbly of limb.)</p><p>The view was fantastic, provided you like a view that resembles a still photograph. Seriously, you could stare out the window for ten minutes at a stretch and never see movement. If it wasn\'t for the odd bird flying by you could make that ten hours.</p><p>Beryl, as you can see, took the opportunity to practice her zen mastery. She stared happily out the window at nothing for ages. Of course, dogs can smell things three miles away, so I imagine there was a rich scent vista to keep her occupied.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDGAi149WqNOjuZPK4RrDiI6eC3t_myXMBT2-XcfKeX7uaN0cEIrrhf0Kzf_uMjD5qQRHW36ewSXq5SFGz7GEzBMIZJ9D0OlqDmWLdj1F9L6Dzh5EEpnwxkThi5NnBfAsFfmjSeLOC8ydtTdunETnPmqW0woscbUOIbEuVsb41_DVO7yKiC9O_61lEWLA/s4080/busberyl2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDGAi149WqNOjuZPK4RrDiI6eC3t_myXMBT2-XcfKeX7uaN0cEIrrhf0Kzf_uMjD5qQRHW36ewSXq5SFGz7GEzBMIZJ9D0OlqDmWLdj1F9L6Dzh5EEpnwxkThi5NnBfAsFfmjSeLOC8ydtTdunETnPmqW0woscbUOIbEuVsb41_DVO7yKiC9O_61lEWLA/w640-h480/busberyl2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Outside, apart from endless, empty fields, there\'s a completely self-contained patio with seats, tables, barbecue equipment and a separate shower unit. We had the bus door open all the time and Beryl could go out safely and potter about with no danger of her wandering off. Not that she would. She doesn\'t like to be more than a few yards away from one or other of us if she can possibly avoid it.</p><p>We did some driving around the local area, which is all farmland, villages and very small market towns. It\'s close to moorland but we didn\'t go onto the moors this time. We did go to a reservoir with the amusing name of <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://www.swlakestrust.org.uk/wimbleball-lake"><i>Wimbleball Lak</i>e</a></span>, though. It was very low after the long, dry summer but the nature reserve around it was great for walking on a sunny, late summer day (Or early autumn, depending how you\'re counting.)</p><p>And that is our holiday for the year. Since we got Beryl we don\'t go far or for long. Maybe one day we\'ll get her inoculated and dog-passported and take her somewhere exotic. Like France. Or even Northern Spain. I think that would be about her limit. She\'s a great traveler and she loves new places but she doesn\'t do well with heat. Perhaps we should go north instead of south...</p><p>We\'re here for now and the foreseeable, though, so normal blogging service may be resumed. Or it may not because I have to figure out a new schedule involving driving over to see my mother three or four times a week instead of once a month as I have done since... well, always.&nbsp;</p><p>Also I have to buy a car to do the driving in. We\'ve always managed with one between us up to now.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which means, if there are unusual gaps in continuity here, that\'s probably why. Although I don\'t really expect it will make that much difference. I can knock these things out a lot faster than I usually do, if I have to.&nbsp;</p><p>Like this one, for example...&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/and-were-back.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/and-were-back.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhaJINPAm6KrpKJ6PLXi8Utjz7B_1l4kPa09z7EV2ItuQFb9yuUV51cmCP3o0nYcn2REexw4KeUCqenkZWodMUGdBu298t1kJ6H2RopIzUgYwnyUldnDNetBzXyZJeCb_Wc3dss2jbfwb14BpLWo9JOOMJ9BSZCTTqSMHrBXxAfE69-9VkBIjYMpUOuOs/s72-w640-h480-c/berylbus1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

I was curious so I went to have a look at what he\'s got to offer. He was very easy to find. He\'s in <i>Qeynos </i>and <i>Freeport </i>(Because in Norrath it\'s standard practice to be two places at once if you\'re an NPC.). I never have a clue where any new NPC is likely to set up their stall in Qeynos but in Freeport it\'s always down by the docks or in the charmingly-named <i>Execution Plaza</i> (Political prisoners executed every hour, on the hour, since 2004.)</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgt5l9ZG6VMJLLhn64PfqH5hGDdAPyIaJGNtZ6e8r5cfGrkywZBcDTrVSZeDNSUoymt6-HqjANUrHx6SZIebWpJUwWOmZ2AcWZJzpqVU2jZEdbVtqvUGlYBgUWeBehENws4CLDJ5sjr2Ogi_gqS1z4AON9y5MQ2MxivDRZKUomoggWXtaXCuMzAPAc9b2I/s730/eq2fablewolf1.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgt5l9ZG6VMJLLhn64PfqH5hGDdAPyIaJGNtZ6e8r5cfGrkywZBcDTrVSZeDNSUoymt6-HqjANUrHx6SZIebWpJUwWOmZ2AcWZJzpqVU2jZEdbVtqvUGlYBgUWeBehENws4CLDJ5sjr2Ogi_gqS1z4AON9y5MQ2MxivDRZKUomoggWXtaXCuMzAPAc9b2I/w270-h400/eq2fablewolf1.jpg" width="270" /></a></div>Better yet, you can ask a guard and get directions. They used to just swivel on their heels and point but now they still do that but also send a glowing trail right to the person you\'re looking for. I tried it just now and Ogor was literally about&nbsp; fifty feet from where I was standing, so that was embarassing.<p></p><p>As you can see, he is not doling out raid gear for a token or two. He hasn\'t got any useable gear at all. Someone more cynical than me might say he hasn\'t got anything <i>useful </i>at all.<br /></p><p>He\'s got a lot of house items, which is always nice but nothing so special you could imagine anyone wanting to unscramble a whole bunch of anagrams, then type the results into a chatbox in the hope of winning a lottery to get enough tokens to buy two of them. And remember, this is "<i>a bit harder of an event</i>", which is why you get two. Mostly, I can only assume, you\'ll be getting just one. If you\'re lucky.</p><p>Other than that, Ogor has a couple of quite nice petamorph wands, some decent appearance-slot robes, a couple of illusion items, some fireworks, two vanity pets and a peculiar-looking ground mount in the shape of a wolf wearing a saddle and bridle. The wolf looks like there\'s moss growing on it, too.</p><p>This is all the same sort of stuff that routinely gets given away in holiday events, of which, as I\'ve noted before, Norrath has a plethora. It appeals to a very specific demographic that seems to make up a significant proportion of forum posters and quite possibly of the playerbase as a whole. I can\'t remember exactly when it happend but at some point in its twenty-year history, EQII became a game suited mostly for absolutely obsessive min-maxers at one end and completist collectionists of fluff at the other, with not an awful lot of room for anyone inbetweeen.</p><p>The latter are going to see some merit in the new Community Token System, I\'m sure, although collectors and decorators tend to be picky. The endgame statisticians are presumably going to ignore it entirely. Whether there\'s much cross-over between the two factions I wouldn\'t care to speculate.</p><p>I don\'t think I\'d go out of my way to earn tokens for any of Ogor\'s stock. If I happen to acquire any, though, I won\'t complain. I\'d quite like those petamorph wands.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKPzcHM_vHDf97UcKdD3iymnfDbD58ObpoCbXHPjdJSphsWDf8pJK-XhS_FSzAJTBfXhmXDfLiSKuqlc1Dnzftw8RFsKP8SZFMY6BsKKqXnNqQ_WW9foDRR5fv_n3A0bqM-Fg_rfyV8p2YsNgL214CA7LebhjHjwSZh8p4izRGwFQW-08ppzErrL8JLrw/s832/eq2fable2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="251" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKPzcHM_vHDf97UcKdD3iymnfDbD58ObpoCbXHPjdJSphsWDf8pJK-XhS_FSzAJTBfXhmXDfLiSKuqlc1Dnzftw8RFsKP8SZFMY6BsKKqXnNqQ_WW9foDRR5fv_n3A0bqM-Fg_rfyV8p2YsNgL214CA7LebhjHjwSZh8p4izRGwFQW-08ppzErrL8JLrw/w400-h251/eq2fable2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>I suppose it\'s going to depend mostly on what the events are like. I note that as well as competitions and similar events on the forums or Discord, Guides can also hand out tokens as rewards in the game itself. I haven\'t seen a guide event for a while but it\'s nice to know they still exist and also that Guides now have a way of encouraging players to join in with ad hoc events rather than just re-running the familiar Guide Quests (Not that those aren\'t always welcome - you can get some nice bags that way.)<p></p><p>Angeliana does also say that "<i>From time to time, he will even get some items added</i>"&nbsp;so we can hope for better, later. I very much doubt he\'ll ever have anything more than cosmetics to give away, though.</p><p>And that\'s fine. When I first read the forum post announcing the new feature I did worry for a moment that it was a replacement for <i>Panda! Panda! Panda!, </i>which does give some very good gear for the minor effort of some extremely easy questing<i>.</i></p><p>The supposed lore explanation "<i>Ogor the Happy, wants terribly to be an adventurer. Alas he cannot, so \nhe needs you to get him some Norrathian Fables and bring them to him. In\n turn, he will let you choose from a plethora of items he happens to \nhave sitting around.</i>" does make his motivation sound remarkably similar to <i>Yun Zi\'</i>s. I suspect that has more to do with lack of imagination than anything else. It\'s also how <i>Qho</i>\'s super-annoying gathering questline is explained.</p><p>Also, I just proved myself a liar by remembering their&nbsp;names immediately, without having to look anything up. I guess some NPCs do familiarize themselves over time after all.</p><p>Good luck getting a funny anagram out of either of their names, though!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjrnOPtwAO0sCufyIquKC7rGKj7sppRwg4WL41U7wSViOf1qJK685c24nwkNoGnL3Ynbx2DJ_Pffjq3VUKdYEfwcEyVeO19BIYuy66oWmg-EP9NTXkQF2BKbVvSywtb5ZGdKrJc2om0hUMXtfesYCOivDScfcYH-SLYotGWYsbJ4-g3fag_5LfAAoRTDc/s1194/eq2ogor1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="254" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjrnOPtwAO0sCufyIquKC7rGKj7sppRwg4WL41U7wSViOf1qJK685c24nwkNoGnL3Ynbx2DJ_Pffjq3VUKdYEfwcEyVeO19BIYuy66oWmg-EP9NTXkQF2BKbVvSywtb5ZGdKrJc2om0hUMXtfesYCOivDScfcYH-SLYotGWYsbJ4-g3fag_5LfAAoRTDc/w640-h254/eq2ogor1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />Introducing...<p><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">The Community Token System</span></b></p><p>Wait!

And remember, this is "<i>a bit harder of an event</i>", which is why you get two. Mostly, I can only assume, you\'ll be getting just one. If you\'re lucky.</p><p>Other than that, Ogor has a couple of quite nice petamorph wands, some decent appearance-slot robes, a couple of illusion items, some fireworks, two vanity pets and a peculiar-looking ground mount in the shape of a wolf wearing a saddle and bridle. The wolf looks like there\'s moss growing on it, too.</p><p>This is all the same sort of stuff that routinely gets given away in holiday events, of which, as I\'ve noted before, Norrath has a plethora. It appeals to a very specific demographic that seems to make up a significant proportion of forum posters and quite possibly of the playerbase as a whole. I can\'t remember exactly when it happend but at some point in its twenty-year history, EQII became a game suited mostly for absolutely obsessive min-maxers at one end and completist collectionists of fluff at the other, with not an awful lot of room for anyone inbetweeen.</p><p>The latter are going to see some merit in the new Community Token System, I\'m sure, although collectors and decorators tend to be picky. The endgame statisticians are presumably going to ignore it entirely. Whether there\'s much cross-over between the two factions I wouldn\'t care to speculate.</p><p>I don\'t think I\'d go out of my way to earn tokens for any of Ogor\'s stock. If I happen to acquire any, though, I won\'t complain. I\'d quite like those petamorph wands.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKPzcHM_vHDf97UcKdD3iymnfDbD58ObpoCbXHPjdJSphsWDf8pJK-XhS_FSzAJTBfXhmXDfLiSKuqlc1Dnzftw8RFsKP8SZFMY6BsKKqXnNqQ_WW9foDRR5fv_n3A0bqM-Fg_rfyV8p2YsNgL214CA7LebhjHjwSZh8p4izRGwFQW-08ppzErrL8JLrw/s832/eq2fable2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="251" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKPzcHM_vHDf97UcKdD3iymnfDbD58ObpoCbXHPjdJSphsWDf8pJK-XhS_FSzAJTBfXhmXDfLiSKuqlc1Dnzftw8RFsKP8SZFMY6BsKKqXnNqQ_WW9foDRR5fv_n3A0bqM-Fg_rfyV8p2YsNgL214CA7LebhjHjwSZh8p4izRGwFQW-08ppzErrL8JLrw/w400-h251/eq2fable2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>I suppose it\'s going to depend mostly on what the events are like. I note that as well as competitions and similar events on the forums or Discord, Guides can also hand out tokens as rewards in the game itself. I haven\'t seen a guide event for a while but it\'s nice to know they still exist and also that Guides now have a way of encouraging players to join in with ad hoc events rather than just re-running the familiar Guide Quests (Not that those aren\'t always welcome - you can get some nice bags that way.)<p></p><p>Angeliana does also say that "<i>From time to time, he will even get some items added</i>"&nbsp;so we can hope for better, later.

When I first read the forum post announcing the new feature I did worry for a moment that it was a replacement for <i>Panda! Panda!

Alas he cannot, so \nhe needs you to get him some Norrathian Fables and bring them to him. In\n turn, he will let you choose from a plethora of items he happens to \nhave sitting around.</i>" does make his motivation sound remarkably similar to <i>Yun Zi\'</i>s. I suspect that has more to do with lack of imagination than anything else. It\'s also how <i>Qho</i>\'s super-annoying gathering questline is explained.</p><p>Also, I just proved myself a liar by remembering their&nbsp;names immediately, without having to look anything up.

After all those years of reading other people blogging about the\n  <i>Civ </i>series and 4X games in general and thinking "<i>Well, it\'s all very interesting to read about but I can\'t imagine ever\n    playing something like that</i>". A bit like <i>EVE </i>or <i>Rimworld </i>or <i>Dwarf Fortress</i>, I\n  guess. Some games are just more fun to read about than play.\n</p>\n<p>Or so I thought. And quite possibly still do. Too soon to say for sure.</p>\n<p>\n  Obviously, I wouldn\'t have tried it at all if I hadn\'t gotten it for free from\n  <i>Prime</i>. I\'m scratching around at the moment, trying to find something to\n  play that can hold my attention but which can also be stopped at a moment\'s\n  notice. I was going through the options when I noticed it and thought, well,\n  why not?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Talking of options, boy, there are a lot of them! Everyone likes to talk about\n  their <i>Steam </i>backlogs but I\'ve always said I don\'t really have that much\n  of one. Which is true, as it goes, although not as true as it used to be. My\n  <i>Amazon Prime Gaming</i> backlog though...\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have 162 games on Prime, of which I have played nineteen and finished five.\n  On <i>GOG </i>I have 60, with just three played and none finished. On\n  <i>Epic Games</i> I have another 40 titles, of which I have played exactly two\n  - and one of those is <i>Fortnite</i>. All of them, across the three\n  platforms, bar a handful, were freebies from Prime - and I probably claim less\n  than half of the games Prime gives away.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And yet somehow, even with almost 250 unplayed titles to choose from, I can\n  never seem to find anything I want to play. Worse, when I do pick something\n  and give it a go, it doesn\'t stick.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is how I came to install and open <i>CivIV </i>a couple of days ago. It\n  seemed like it might be worth a try. I mean, everyone else seems to enjoy\n  it...\n</p>\n<p>So, did I? Enjoy it, that is?</p>\n<p>Hmm. Tough question. I\'ll get back to you when I have an answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBXdE89LcrefyXCyUbF99vpb3slJvO8RkVS6uFUUTIDamNwPq7_mCeLvM55f0tyVcgr_rGMEsr4ZtRgRAijzwj_MC-rLyaYTdEFF9w8JJAWTY2XrSCY7njQGfL0CFUYh4FjwiCcraE0oHRdAEWJ0tDG9wZ-dQeCBEv0h5D-wFj1fZLcP7mP0x5lDXDIp0/s1024/civ3.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBXdE89LcrefyXCyUbF99vpb3slJvO8RkVS6uFUUTIDamNwPq7_mCeLvM55f0tyVcgr_rGMEsr4ZtRgRAijzwj_MC-rLyaYTdEFF9w8JJAWTY2XrSCY7njQGfL0CFUYh4FjwiCcraE0oHRdAEWJ0tDG9wZ-dQeCBEv0h5D-wFj1fZLcP7mP0x5lDXDIp0/w640-h480/civ3.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><br /><p></p>\n<p>\n  So far I\'ve played for a couple of hours in two sessions and it\'s been...\n  occupying. Time certainly passes. There\'s a lot to do. It keeps you busy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For my first session I jumped straight in and started playing. That wasn\'t so\n  much a choice as a mistake, by which I don\'t mean it went badly, just that I\n  didn\'t mean to do it. I assumed there\'d be an in-game tutorial. There is not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There <i>is </i>a Tutorial, of course. I just didn\'t notice it was a separate\n  option on the main menu. I\'d completely forgotten that\'s how they used to do\n  it in the old days.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Starting without any kind of lead-in or explanation was an odd experience.\n  Confusing but also fairly straightforward, by which I mean the game is somehow\n  still playable, even when you have absolutely no idea what you\'re doing or\n  indeed what you ought to be doing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s mainly because every single UI element seems to have a mouse-over\n  tool-tip and most actions seem to require not much more than a left click. I\n  just moused over everything and started clicking and something approximating a\n  game seemed to coalesce around me.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I left everything on the defaults. I built a city. I killed some bears. I\n  explored to clear the fog of war. I built another city. I kept picking from\n  lists of options and the years rolled by. I started at the dawn of\n  civilization, 4000 BC, and by the time I finished an hour later it was the\n  Renaissance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For some reason I kept founding religions, which seemed extremely weird. I was\n  playing as Spain and yet I still managed to found Buddhism, then Confucianism,\n  then Taoism. I would have thought a necessary corollary of founding\n  Confucianism, for example, would be that you\'d have to be <i>Confucius</i>, or\n  for a ruler to take the credit, they\'d at least need to count Confucius as a\n  subject. It seemed unlikely either he or Buddha would have been living in\n  Barcelona or Madrid at the time but I guess they must have gotten there from\n  China somehow...\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg90rQFY3XjlgH74vvvtWqTaXc20aybrKFw4O9xwOx6E9BJaScEwHZoslfGRHcdLzQOhmqJ5ER4-uGWyGY2xZp8RY2opptsUQfO3nBG57qz5eDnqHNP8ERvL-q0w2Zb_UvQ3ZmuCZeh-Fz-7L6Kkn0Q8WIqgWQwThOPAv8oZ5ILj0Z6XqMu6cuqRk8CD-M/s1024/civ4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg90rQFY3XjlgH74vvvtWqTaXc20aybrKFw4O9xwOx6E9BJaScEwHZoslfGRHcdLzQOhmqJ5ER4-uGWyGY2xZp8RY2opptsUQfO3nBG57qz5eDnqHNP8ERvL-q0w2Zb_UvQ3ZmuCZeh-Fz-7L6Kkn0Q8WIqgWQwThOPAv8oZ5ILj0Z6XqMu6cuqRk8CD-M/w640-h480/civ4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Other leaders kept popping up to ask me to make deals with them or break deals\n  I\'d made with other nations. I always agreed with whatever they wanted and\n  always made peace not war. I hadn\'t figured out how to get my army to fight\n  anyone except bears and lions so peace seemed like the best option.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I had trouble getting any of my units to go where I wanted anyway. I lost\n  Barcelona because someone attacked it and I couldn\'t figure out how to get a\n  Warrior unit over there in time. It didn\'t seem to matter much because by then\n  I had a third city and I was having more than enough trouble managing two of\n  them. I was quite glad to see Barcelona go.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I could tell there was some kind of score being kept in the lower right-hand\n  corner of the screen but I didn\'t really know what made the numbers change or\n  what the victory condition might be. I figured bigger numbers were probably\n  better, though, and Spain was either at the top of the list or at least in the\n  top half most of the time. There were always other civilizations doing a lot\n  worse than me so I was happy enough with how things were going.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that went on for a little over an hour before it started to get on top\n  of me a bit. I figured out how to save the game and stopped. I could see how\n  someone could get into that "<i>Just one more turn</i>" frame of mind I\'ve\n  read about, especially if they knew what they were doing. It is quite\n  compulsive, pushing the button to see what happens next.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I guess I must have enjoyed myself at least a little because yesterday I felt\n  like having another go. I thought maybe I ought to try and find out at least a\n  little about how to play so I googled around for a while and learned... there\n  <i>is </i>a Tutorial after all. I did think it was strange there wasn\'t one\n  but then I thought maybe, back in the day, the game would have come in a box\n  with a manual as thick as a novel and you were probably supposed to read that\n  before you got started.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSpmr7SN2WhO6mFcVhnVf7BL6I0fsoSPYumCAsZUlgFE06s7J4-GpF9m3ROKmGJNNZhGJq404F_k1Z54rX2XB8YV4TyXnFrFNReiD3G8021LBrPQSeAkihtvw0oQ1TfpEjUgD1y0BOql4ZzVd8tklAvqxeFgkKF9CHvwRtM7ZQvWA0ZIBhFsMhC28c2l8/s1024/civsid1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSpmr7SN2WhO6mFcVhnVf7BL6I0fsoSPYumCAsZUlgFE06s7J4-GpF9m3ROKmGJNNZhGJq404F_k1Z54rX2XB8YV4TyXnFrFNReiD3G8021LBrPQSeAkihtvw0oQ1TfpEjUgD1y0BOql4ZzVd8tklAvqxeFgkKF9CHvwRtM7ZQvWA0ZIBhFsMhC28c2l8/w640-h480/civsid1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nLast night I tried again, only this time I didn\'t load up my saved game. I\nopened the tutorial instead.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I learned a few things, not least what <i>Sid Meier </i>sounds like. At least,\n  I assume that\'s him, reading out the instructions, like a high school history\n  teacher, following a familiar lesson plan on a warm afternoon in front of a\n  drowsy classroom, just before school breaks up for summer. And the balding\n  fellow with the fixed smile, dressed like a sales assistant at a discount\n  warehouse? That must be Sid, too. The guy clearly doesn\'t have much of an ego.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The tutorial was helpful, anyway. The most important thing I learned was that\n  you have to right-click to get anyone to go where you tell them. That\n  explained a lot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There was some useful information about <i>why </i>you might want to do\n  certain things, too, not just how you\'d make them happen. As I said, for the\n  most part it\'s not too hard to figure out what things do from&nbsp; the tool\n  tips but it\'s much harder to see why you\'d want to do any of them. I mostly\n  just picked stuff I like, like art and literature and music and ignored all\n  the boring agriculture and industry. I probably should have played Greece.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What became clear from the tutorial is that the game is basically a management\n  sim. In all the thousands and thousands of words I\'d read about it, I don\'t\n  think that had ever really come across. People always blog about the\n  interesting stuff, don\'t they? Who declared war on whom or who invented what.\n  They never tell you how many tiny little repetitive actions it took before\n  anything interesting happened at all.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRg2QKnJ6C-HRljoAR0nIzHbcE9HuduOiT1hOliwJPI8uwhc-uTmTiCFdqHhEtvkA6xYT-NRIt_luyeVoeDBavj95uB-aC8khLoLK9U28L3krrB9Ho66QrPuqX_7dNUnHCoz3FSoPLgNMKdzyQHh9cJ_i4ixTHbKxw6iu2N_IbCyUmTA_ZQ6qOE7pC0oA/s304/Dictator1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRg2QKnJ6C-HRljoAR0nIzHbcE9HuduOiT1hOliwJPI8uwhc-uTmTiCFdqHhEtvkA6xYT-NRIt_luyeVoeDBavj95uB-aC8khLoLK9U28L3krrB9Ho66QrPuqX_7dNUnHCoz3FSoPLgNMKdzyQHh9cJ_i4ixTHbKxw6iu2N_IbCyUmTA_ZQ6qOE7pC0oA/w263-h400/Dictator1.png" width="263" /></a>\n</div>\nI was about to say I\'ve never liked management sims but then it occurred to me\nthat\'s not entirely true. Right at the beginning of my gaming life, I used to\nplay them quite enthusiastically. I remember one my ex-wife and I used to play a\nlot on the ZX Spectrum, a political sim where you had to manage all kinds of\nfactors to keep yourself in power. I remember we used to sit there in our bean\nbags and shout at the screen.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I think it was called\n  <i><a href="https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/31109/Dictator/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Dictator</span></a></i>. Yep! That\'s the one. I bet I still have the cassette somewhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I even wrote a management sim once. I think it might be the only game I ever\n  coded from scratch. I wrote it one afternoon at my mother\'s house on my\n  step-father\'s <i>Oric </i>computer that he\'d won in some competition and never\n  used. It had some ridiculously tiny memory measured in kilobytes and I wrote a\n  moonbase sim for it that worked, just about. I wrote it in RAM, though, so it\n  only existed for that afternoon and never again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that was back in the eighties. The early eighties. I don\'t believe I\'ve\n  played a management sim since.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, the 4X genre is a hybrid, with other gameplay beyond resource\n  management. There\'s a big map to explore and you can fight animals and people\n  but most importantly there are all those familiar names. That\'s what makes it\n  interesting.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And surreal. It\'s very peculiar to have <i>Elizabeth I</i> suddenly appear and\n  start schmoozing you, especially when <i>Julius Caesar</i> just left. It\n  reminded me a bit of that <i>Philip Jose Farmer</i> series,\n  <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverworld"><i>Riverworld</i></a></span>, where everyone who ever lived has been brought back to life at the same\n  time, in the same place. Without that, I doubt it would be half as engaging.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I stuck with the tutorial for about an hour but then it was time for Beryl\'s\n  evening walk so I had to stop. I couldn\'t see any way to save the tutorial so\n  I just logged out. If I have to go back to the beginning and do it over, I\n  don\'t think I\'ll bother. I reckon I know enough to get started now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Will I, though? Am I engaged enough with the concept for another session?\n  Possibly. It does, as I said, occupy the mind, which is welcome at the moment,\n  as I negotiate some changes in routine, with&nbsp;my 93 year-old mother\n  suddenly needing a lot more support to stay in her home than usual and her\n  living an hour\'s drive away and we only having the one car.\n</p>\n<p>\n  On the other hand, there are plenty of games that do a pretty good job of\n  occupying the mind and I can think of plenty whose gameplay would be more to\n  my taste than 4X offers.

A bit like <i>EVE </i>or <i>Rimworld </i>or <i>Dwarf Fortress</i>, I\n  guess. Some games are just more fun to read about than play.\n</p>\n<p>Or so I thought. And quite possibly still do. Too soon to say for sure.</p>\n<p>\n  Obviously, I wouldn\'t have tried it at all if I hadn\'t gotten it for free from\n  <i>Prime</i>. I\'m scratching around at the moment, trying to find something to\n  play that can hold my attention but which can also be stopped at a moment\'s\n  notice. I was going through the options when I noticed it and thought, well,\n  why not?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Talking of options, boy, there are a lot of them! Everyone likes to talk about\n  their <i>Steam </i>backlogs but I\'ve always said I don\'t really have that much\n  of one. Which is true, as it goes, although not as true as it used to be. My\n  <i>Amazon Prime Gaming</i> backlog though...\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have 162 games on Prime, of which I have played nineteen and finished five.\n  On <i>GOG </i>I have 60, with just three played and none finished. On\n  <i>Epic Games</i> I have another 40 titles, of which I have played exactly two\n  - and one of those is <i>Fortnite</i>. All of them, across the three\n  platforms, bar a handful, were freebies from Prime - and I probably claim less\n  than half of the games Prime gives away.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And yet somehow, even with almost 250 unplayed titles to choose from, I can\n  never seem to find anything I want to play. Worse, when I do pick something\n  and give it a go, it doesn\'t stick.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is how I came to install and open <i>CivIV </i>a couple of days ago. It\n  seemed like it might be worth a try. I mean, everyone else seems to enjoy\n  it...\n</p>\n<p>So, did I? Enjoy it, that is?</p>\n<p>Hmm. Tough question. I\'ll get back to you when I have an answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBXdE89LcrefyXCyUbF99vpb3slJvO8RkVS6uFUUTIDamNwPq7_mCeLvM55f0tyVcgr_rGMEsr4ZtRgRAijzwj_MC-rLyaYTdEFF9w8JJAWTY2XrSCY7njQGfL0CFUYh4FjwiCcraE0oHRdAEWJ0tDG9wZ-dQeCBEv0h5D-wFj1fZLcP7mP0x5lDXDIp0/s1024/civ3.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBXdE89LcrefyXCyUbF99vpb3slJvO8RkVS6uFUUTIDamNwPq7_mCeLvM55f0tyVcgr_rGMEsr4ZtRgRAijzwj_MC-rLyaYTdEFF9w8JJAWTY2XrSCY7njQGfL0CFUYh4FjwiCcraE0oHRdAEWJ0tDG9wZ-dQeCBEv0h5D-wFj1fZLcP7mP0x5lDXDIp0/w640-h480/civ3.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><br /><p></p>\n<p>\n  So far I\'ve played for a couple of hours in two sessions and it\'s been...\n  occupying. Time certainly passes. There\'s a lot to do. It keeps you busy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For my first session I jumped straight in and started playing. That wasn\'t so\n  much a choice as a mistake, by which I don\'t mean it went badly, just that I\n  didn\'t mean to do it. I assumed there\'d be an in-game tutorial. There is not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There <i>is </i>a Tutorial, of course. I just didn\'t notice it was a separate\n  option on the main menu. I\'d completely forgotten that\'s how they used to do\n  it in the old days.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Starting without any kind of lead-in or explanation was an odd experience.\n  Confusing but also fairly straightforward, by which I mean the game is somehow\n  still playable, even when you have absolutely no idea what you\'re doing or\n  indeed what you ought to be doing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s mainly because every single UI element seems to have a mouse-over\n  tool-tip and most actions seem to require not much more than a left click. I\n  just moused over everything and started clicking and something approximating a\n  game seemed to coalesce around me.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I left everything on the defaults. I built a city. I killed some bears. I\n  explored to clear the fog of war. I built another city. I kept picking from\n  lists of options and the years rolled by. I started at the dawn of\n  civilization, 4000 BC, and by the time I finished an hour later it was the\n  Renaissance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For some reason I kept founding religions, which seemed extremely weird. I was\n  playing as Spain and yet I still managed to found Buddhism, then Confucianism,\n  then Taoism. I would have thought a necessary corollary of founding\n  Confucianism, for example, would be that you\'d have to be <i>Confucius</i>, or\n  for a ruler to take the credit, they\'d at least need to count Confucius as a\n  subject. It seemed unlikely either he or Buddha would have been living in\n  Barcelona or Madrid at the time but I guess they must have gotten there from\n  China somehow...\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg90rQFY3XjlgH74vvvtWqTaXc20aybrKFw4O9xwOx6E9BJaScEwHZoslfGRHcdLzQOhmqJ5ER4-uGWyGY2xZp8RY2opptsUQfO3nBG57qz5eDnqHNP8ERvL-q0w2Zb_UvQ3ZmuCZeh-Fz-7L6Kkn0Q8WIqgWQwThOPAv8oZ5ILj0Z6XqMu6cuqRk8CD-M/s1024/civ4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg90rQFY3XjlgH74vvvtWqTaXc20aybrKFw4O9xwOx6E9BJaScEwHZoslfGRHcdLzQOhmqJ5ER4-uGWyGY2xZp8RY2opptsUQfO3nBG57qz5eDnqHNP8ERvL-q0w2Zb_UvQ3ZmuCZeh-Fz-7L6Kkn0Q8WIqgWQwThOPAv8oZ5ILj0Z6XqMu6cuqRk8CD-M/w640-h480/civ4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Other leaders kept popping up to ask me to make deals with them or break deals\n  I\'d made with other nations. I always agreed with whatever they wanted and\n  always made peace not war. I hadn\'t figured out how to get my army to fight\n  anyone except bears and lions so peace seemed like the best option.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I had trouble getting any of my units to go where I wanted anyway. I lost\n  Barcelona because someone attacked it and I couldn\'t figure out how to get a\n  Warrior unit over there in time. It didn\'t seem to matter much because by then\n  I had a third city and I was having more than enough trouble managing two of\n  them. I was quite glad to see Barcelona go.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I could tell there was some kind of score being kept in the lower right-hand\n  corner of the screen but I didn\'t really know what made the numbers change or\n  what the victory condition might be. I figured bigger numbers were probably\n  better, though, and Spain was either at the top of the list or at least in the\n  top half most of the time. There were always other civilizations doing a lot\n  worse than me so I was happy enough with how things were going.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that went on for a little over an hour before it started to get on top\n  of me a bit. I figured out how to save the game and stopped. I could see how\n  someone could get into that "<i>Just one more turn</i>" frame of mind I\'ve\n  read about, especially if they knew what they were doing. It is quite\n  compulsive, pushing the button to see what happens next.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I guess I must have enjoyed myself at least a little because yesterday I felt\n  like having another go. I thought maybe I ought to try and find out at least a\n  little about how to play so I googled around for a while and learned... there\n  <i>is </i>a Tutorial after all. I did think it was strange there wasn\'t one\n  but then I thought maybe, back in the day, the game would have come in a box\n  with a manual as thick as a novel and you were probably supposed to read that\n  before you got started.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSpmr7SN2WhO6mFcVhnVf7BL6I0fsoSPYumCAsZUlgFE06s7J4-GpF9m3ROKmGJNNZhGJq404F_k1Z54rX2XB8YV4TyXnFrFNReiD3G8021LBrPQSeAkihtvw0oQ1TfpEjUgD1y0BOql4ZzVd8tklAvqxeFgkKF9CHvwRtM7ZQvWA0ZIBhFsMhC28c2l8/s1024/civsid1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSpmr7SN2WhO6mFcVhnVf7BL6I0fsoSPYumCAsZUlgFE06s7J4-GpF9m3ROKmGJNNZhGJq404F_k1Z54rX2XB8YV4TyXnFrFNReiD3G8021LBrPQSeAkihtvw0oQ1TfpEjUgD1y0BOql4ZzVd8tklAvqxeFgkKF9CHvwRtM7ZQvWA0ZIBhFsMhC28c2l8/w640-h480/civsid1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nLast night I tried again, only this time I didn\'t load up my saved game. I\nopened the tutorial instead.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I learned a few things, not least what <i>Sid Meier </i>sounds like. At least,\n  I assume that\'s him, reading out the instructions, like a high school history\n  teacher, following a familiar lesson plan on a warm afternoon in front of a\n  drowsy classroom, just before school breaks up for summer. And the balding\n  fellow with the fixed smile, dressed like a sales assistant at a discount\n  warehouse? That must be Sid, too. The guy clearly doesn\'t have much of an ego.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The tutorial was helpful, anyway. The most important thing I learned was that\n  you have to right-click to get anyone to go where you tell them. That\n  explained a lot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There was some useful information about <i>why </i>you might want to do\n  certain things, too, not just how you\'d make them happen. As I said, for the\n  most part it\'s not too hard to figure out what things do from&nbsp; the tool\n  tips but it\'s much harder to see why you\'d want to do any of them. I mostly\n  just picked stuff I like, like art and literature and music and ignored all\n  the boring agriculture and industry. I probably should have played Greece.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What became clear from the tutorial is that the game is basically a management\n  sim. In all the thousands and thousands of words I\'d read about it, I don\'t\n  think that had ever really come across. People always blog about the\n  interesting stuff, don\'t they? Who declared war on whom or who invented what.\n  They never tell you how many tiny little repetitive actions it took before\n  anything interesting happened at all.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRg2QKnJ6C-HRljoAR0nIzHbcE9HuduOiT1hOliwJPI8uwhc-uTmTiCFdqHhEtvkA6xYT-NRIt_luyeVoeDBavj95uB-aC8khLoLK9U28L3krrB9Ho66QrPuqX_7dNUnHCoz3FSoPLgNMKdzyQHh9cJ_i4ixTHbKxw6iu2N_IbCyUmTA_ZQ6qOE7pC0oA/s304/Dictator1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRg2QKnJ6C-HRljoAR0nIzHbcE9HuduOiT1hOliwJPI8uwhc-uTmTiCFdqHhEtvkA6xYT-NRIt_luyeVoeDBavj95uB-aC8khLoLK9U28L3krrB9Ho66QrPuqX_7dNUnHCoz3FSoPLgNMKdzyQHh9cJ_i4ixTHbKxw6iu2N_IbCyUmTA_ZQ6qOE7pC0oA/w263-h400/Dictator1.png" width="263" /></a>\n</div>\nI was about to say I\'ve never liked management sims but then it occurred to me\nthat\'s not entirely true. Right at the beginning of my gaming life, I used to\nplay them quite enthusiastically. I remember one my ex-wife and I used to play a\nlot on the ZX Spectrum, a political sim where you had to manage all kinds of\nfactors to keep yourself in power. I remember we used to sit there in our bean\nbags and shout at the screen.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I think it was called\n  <i><a href="https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/31109/Dictator/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Dictator</span></a></i>. Yep! That\'s the one. I bet I still have the cassette somewhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I even wrote a management sim once. I think it might be the only game I ever\n  coded from scratch. I wrote it one afternoon at my mother\'s house on my\n  step-father\'s <i>Oric </i>computer that he\'d won in some competition and never\n  used. It had some ridiculously tiny memory measured in kilobytes and I wrote a\n  moonbase sim for it that worked, just about. I wrote it in RAM, though, so it\n  only existed for that afternoon and never again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that was back in the eighties. The early eighties. I don\'t believe I\'ve\n  played a management sim since.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, the 4X genre is a hybrid, with other gameplay beyond resource\n  management. There\'s a big map to explore and you can fight animals and people\n  but most importantly there are all those familiar names. That\'s what makes it\n  interesting.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And surreal. It\'s very peculiar to have <i>Elizabeth I</i> suddenly appear and\n  start schmoozing you, especially when <i>Julius Caesar</i> just left. It\n  reminded me a bit of that <i>Philip Jose Farmer</i> series,\n  <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverworld"><i>Riverworld</i></a></span>, where everyone who ever lived has been brought back to life at the same\n  time, in the same place. Without that, I doubt it would be half as engaging.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I stuck with the tutorial for about an hour but then it was time for Beryl\'s\n  evening walk so I had to stop. I couldn\'t see any way to save the tutorial so\n  I just logged out. If I have to go back to the beginning and do it over, I\n  don\'t think I\'ll bother. I reckon I know enough to get started now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Will I, though? Am I engaged enough with the concept for another session?\n  Possibly. It does, as I said, occupy the mind, which is welcome at the moment,\n  as I negotiate some changes in routine, with&nbsp;my 93 year-old mother\n  suddenly needing a lot more support to stay in her home than usual and her\n  living an hour\'s drive away and we only having the one car.\n</p>\n<p>\n  On the other hand, there are plenty of games that do a pretty good job of\n  occupying the mind and I can think of plenty whose gameplay would be more to\n  my taste than 4X offers. Just none of the ones I already own,\n  apparently.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>Maybe this is the time to buy <i>Baldur\'s Gate 3</i>.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/how-very-civilized.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/how-very-civilized.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxPHymqJHu9dFhtE8pDO8lAu4tX6qTia6L1vN0VzoUEXPvmBZZC9jZ_NXiBKvHzrAYTVXglfowbDYBY4xYAivGE0jhFXFC9WIbqYUX-EXXYIP8ghpIjPm5CQ3Un9IAboOEERxKoLQ0cWzE1__RRrYabRn8lpSMFdpmz_ueCb92oU0VGB1zFRUrrJRhZfs/s72-w640-h480-c/civ2.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '3'}

As I said in the comment thread to his post, it\'s largely replaced\nplaying video games for me, in the way playing games once replaced watching\ntelevision. I very much doubt it\'ll hold my attention for more than two decades, the way\nMMORPGs did, but for now it\'s still feeling quite compulsive.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  There\'s probably a whole series of posts I could write about various aspects of making music this\n  way - practical, philosophical, aesthetic, ethical, legal - but not right now.\n  Today I just thought I\'d share an idea I had for a parlor game, to be played\n  using your LLM of choice, an idea that only occurred to me last night as I was\n  asking mine, which happens to be <i>Gemini,&nbsp;</i>a question.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, when I\'m working with Suno, I make up my whole prompts from scratch. I do\n  re-use a lot of them, often with certain key phrases changed, trying to\n  finesse the exact result I\'m after, but I\'m not usually trying to re-create\n  the signature sound of a specific band or singer, more the sounds I hear in my\n  head.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Occasionally, though, I look at something I\'ve written and wonder what it\n  might sound like if it had been covered by someone I like. Or, for that\n  matter, don\'t like. Even more occasionally I find myself wanting to make\n  something that sounds entirely <i>unlike </i>anything I\'d come up with on my own, both for inspiration and\n  variety.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To that end, now and again, I go to Gemini and ask it to give me a prompt for\n  Suno that describes how a particular genre or band sounds. Feed those into Suno unedited and the results aren\'t often all\n  that close. You can always recognize the influences but it\'s not like you can copy and paste from one AI to another and pump out convincing ersatz albums by your favorite acts like some kind of\n  amateur\n  <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops_(record_series)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Top of the Pops</span></a>&nbsp;</i>knock-off operation. Well, not yet, anyway.\n</p>\n<p>It would be an amusing party game to generate a bunch of those, play them\n  and have people try to guess who they were supposed to be. I can imagine that being\n  a lot of fun with enough drink taken. If I thought anyone would actually take\n  the time to click through and listen, I might have knocked out a few myself and included them here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But that would be a lot of work and I\'d be surprised if more than a handful of\n  readers would be interested enough to listen to even a few bars. That sort of thing really requires a bunch of people together in a room to be fun.&nbsp;</p><p>What would be\n  much easier and also a better game for a blog would be if I just copied and\n  pasted a few of Gemini\'s prompts to see if anyone can recognize the acts from the\n  descriptions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Gemini is pretty good at describing what singers and bands sound like.\n  Disturbingly good, actually. The shorthand explanation of how "<i><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/the-surprising-power-of-next-word-prediction-large-language-models-explained-part-1/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">LLMs work by analysing vast banks of data to ascertain the next most\n        likely word</span></a></i>" seems to collapse pretty quickly when you look at the results.\n  Self-evidently, there\'s more to it than that, or the output wouldn\'t be so\n  convincing. When I saw the descriptions I was getting, my first thought was\n  that Gemini had to be precising a whole bunch of reviews and picking out the\n  most commonly-expressed opinions but even if that\'s all it is doing, it\'s weirdly accurate.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What it mostly makes me think is that well-known bands and singers have such a\n  definitive, known, recognizable style it can quite easily be encoded in a\n  couple of paragraphs. A test of how accurate that encoding is might be to ask\n  someone if they could tell the band from Gemini\'s description of what they\n  sound like.\n</p>\n<p>And if that\'s not a parlor game, I don\'t know what is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Oh, one other thing.

As I said in the comment thread to his post, it\'s largely replaced\nplaying video games for me, in the way playing games once replaced watching\ntelevision. I very much doubt it\'ll hold my attention for more than two decades, the way\nMMORPGs did, but for now it\'s still feeling quite compulsive.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  There\'s probably a whole series of posts I could write about various aspects of making music this\n  way - practical, philosophical, aesthetic, ethical, legal - but not right now.\n  Today I just thought I\'d share an idea I had for a parlor game, to be played\n  using your LLM of choice, an idea that only occurred to me last night as I was\n  asking mine, which happens to be <i>Gemini,&nbsp;</i>a question.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, when I\'m working with Suno, I make up my whole prompts from scratch. I do\n  re-use a lot of them, often with certain key phrases changed, trying to\n  finesse the exact result I\'m after, but I\'m not usually trying to re-create\n  the signature sound of a specific band or singer, more the sounds I hear in my\n  head.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Occasionally, though, I look at something I\'ve written and wonder what it\n  might sound like if it had been covered by someone I like. Or, for that\n  matter, don\'t like. Even more occasionally I find myself wanting to make\n  something that sounds entirely <i>unlike </i>anything I\'d come up with on my own, both for inspiration and\n  variety.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To that end, now and again, I go to Gemini and ask it to give me a prompt for\n  Suno that describes how a particular genre or band sounds. Feed those into Suno unedited and the results aren\'t often all\n  that close. You can always recognize the influences but it\'s not like you can copy and paste from one AI to another and pump out convincing ersatz albums by your favorite acts like some kind of\n  amateur\n  <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops_(record_series)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Top of the Pops</span></a>&nbsp;</i>knock-off operation. Well, not yet, anyway.\n</p>\n<p>It would be an amusing party game to generate a bunch of those, play them\n  and have people try to guess who they were supposed to be. I can imagine that being\n  a lot of fun with enough drink taken. If I thought anyone would actually take\n  the time to click through and listen, I might have knocked out a few myself and included them here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But that would be a lot of work and I\'d be surprised if more than a handful of\n  readers would be interested enough to listen to even a few bars. That sort of thing really requires a bunch of people together in a room to be fun.&nbsp;</p><p>What would be\n  much easier and also a better game for a blog would be if I just copied and\n  pasted a few of Gemini\'s prompts to see if anyone can recognize the acts from the\n  descriptions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Gemini is pretty good at describing what singers and bands sound like.\n  Disturbingly good, actually. The shorthand explanation of how "<i><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/the-surprising-power-of-next-word-prediction-large-language-models-explained-part-1/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">LLMs work by analysing vast banks of data to ascertain the next most\n        likely word</span></a></i>" seems to collapse pretty quickly when you look at the results.\n  Self-evidently, there\'s more to it than that, or the output wouldn\'t be so\n  convincing. When I saw the descriptions I was getting, my first thought was\n  that Gemini had to be precising a whole bunch of reviews and picking out the\n  most commonly-expressed opinions but even if that\'s all it is doing, it\'s weirdly accurate.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What it mostly makes me think is that well-known bands and singers have such a\n  definitive, known, recognizable style it can quite easily be encoded in a\n  couple of paragraphs. A test of how accurate that encoding is might be to ask\n  someone if they could tell the band from Gemini\'s description of what they\n  sound like.\n</p>\n<p>And if that\'s not a parlor game, I don\'t know what is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Oh, one other thing. When I started doing this, Suno had a two-hundred\n  character limit on prompts. That forced Gemini to be very succinct. I think\n  those make for a better game, although they\'re far less interesting in\n  themselves than the ones it puts up for the new thousand-character limit.\n  Those are more like entries in a musical dictionary.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Shall we try a couple?

It\'s not that I didn\'t notice. I\n  did. I just thought "<i>Huh. That\'s a dumb pun...</i>" and immediately forgot\n  about it.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  With that in mind, it might be as well to treat anything more I have to say\n  about the show with some caution. Clearly I am not going to be a very reliable\n  witness. But, hey, you work with what you\'ve got.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And in that framework, I\'m going to say I found the second half of the season\n  very much more to my liking than the first. Not that I didn\'t enjoy Episodes 1\n  to 4. I enjoyed them quite a bit. I just didn\'t see how they were leading to\n  anything or even going anywhere much.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Episodes 5 to 8 went everywhere and lead to a lot. A lot of deaths. A lot of\n  revelations. A lot of changes. Oh, probably ought to give the spoiler warning\n  now... but that one I used <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/wednesday-addams-half-term-report.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">last time</span></a> was really annoying, wasn\'t it? And\n  everyone here can read, right? So if you haven\'t seen the show and plan to,\n  maybe this would be a good time to go find something else to do. Maybe\n  bookmark this for later. It\'s not like I want to lose the page views...\n</p>\n<p>Okay, we all good?&nbsp; Then let us continue.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I thought all four episodes on the downslope of the season were excellent.\n  Much more engaging than the earlier ones and also less bitty. There seemed to\n  be a lot more of Wednesday and she was more central to the action. The rest of\n  the Addams Family were there but their presence felt more in context, rather than the\n  somewhat shoehorned-in plot mechanics employed in Part 1, when the writers had to come up with a reason for them to be there at all. With their continuing presence\n  explained and established, they felt more like supporting cast members, no\n  different from the teaching staff or the Sheriff, instead of pulling all the\n  attention to themselves and away from the actual star.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Speaking of whom, <i>Jenny Ortega</i> was on particularly fine form, I\n  thought. The body-swap episode, which I loved, made it very clear just how\n  much acting she\'s doing, something that\'s not always apparent. I don\'t really\n  know her well from any of her other work, although obviously I know of it and\n  did before the show even aired, so in my mind the Wednesday Addams character\n  and the actor playing her were mostly interchangeable.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When the most important thing you have to do as an actor is maintain almost\n  the exact same expression and tone of voice throughout, it makes it quite hard for\n  an audience to realize just how much work you\'re doing. With Enid inhabiting\n  her, Wednesday was free to laugh, smile, talk in something other than a\n  monotone and even move her arms as she walked. Or, I should say, skipped!\n</p>\n<p>\n  The opening of that episode, where Enid-as-Wednesday is in full KPop dance\n  mode, is a great shock start and one of the rare times the trope of starting\n  the story at the end (Well, the middle in this case.) and then tossing up the\n  "<i>16 hours Earlier</i>" interstitial actually worked. Honestly, it felt genuinely outrageous. I was ready to be outraged. And then I was charmed and\n  delighted instead, which is a pretty fine bait&amp;switch if you can pull it\n  off.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Speaking of Enid, she gets far more to do in the second half of the season.\n  Oh, sure, she\'s in the first four episodes, all the time, but she doesn\'t know\n  what\'s going on and the atmosphere between her and Wednesday is sour and it\n  never feels comfortable. I know, I know... Wednesday isn\'t supposed to be\n  cosy. But still, you want the team to pull together, don\'t you? I do, anyway.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  <i>Emma Myers</i> is excellent as Enid as always and her story arc develops in a very\n  interesting fashion. As with everything in the show - and in most fantasy\n  shows if we\'re going to be sensible about it - a lot of things don\'t bear\n  close examination. I\'m not entirely convinced by the Alpha lore, or perhaps\n  it\'s the naming convention that\'s confusing. Wouldn\'t the Alpha be the\n  dominant pack member? Why would the pack shun their Alpha, let alone hunt her down and\n  kill her?\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  That, however, may all be explained at some future stage, most likely in\n  Season 3, since the really excellent ending of Season 2 sets everything up for just that. And since I\'ve mentioned it already I\'ll take the end out of order. I just\n  loved it and I can tell you exactly why.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For one thing it\'s a set-up, not a cliffhanger. It\'s the best way to go out of\n  a season, leaving your audience excited for what might come next, rather than\n  frustrated because something got cut off in mid-flow.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  For another, it\'s a very open-ended set-up. It\'s entirely possible the third\n  season of Wednesday might not be set in Nevermore Academy at all. All those\n  problems with the students starting to look like they really ought to be doing\n  post-grad work just fall away if the school setting isn\'t there as a\n  backdrop.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And for the third and possibly best thing (Apologies to the actual <i>Thing</i>.) it brings back\n  <i>Uncle Fester</i> along with the delicious possibility of a prolonged\n  Wednesday-Fester double act. I\'d take a whole spin-off series of that.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Season 3 could be a wilderness adventure, a road-trip or pretty much anything.\n  Or it could be a pre-credit sequence, then back to Nevermore. For\n  that matter, Season 3 could take place entirely in the summer break and Season\n  4 could be the start of the next academic year.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I hope not, though, and I\'m not sure Nevermore is even still in business, anyway.\n  There\'s one line in the last episode, I forget who\'s speaking, where someone\n  clearly suggests the school has closed. Possibly for good.</p><p>For that matter, I was never sure just\n  how much of the school year had passed by the end of Season 2. All the parents turn up and everyone goes home but is that the end of the Fall\n  semester or has a whole year gone round? Or have they all just turned up to\n  take the kids away because&nbsp;the place is on fire and the Principal has just been publicly exposed as a murdering con-man?</p>\n<p>\n  Oh, yeah, and he\'s dead, too. The Principal, that is. And one of the\n  teachers. And there\'s a dead Hyde on the werewolf statue. And a couple more\n  people died earlier. It\'s a bloodbath (Except blood is one thing you never\n  seem to see - it\'s a very not-gory show, oddly.)\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Throughout the season but mainly in Part 2, a lot of people die, including a\n  whole bunch of major supporting characters played by famous guest actors.\n  <i>Steve Buscemi, Christina Ricci, Christopher Lloyd</i>... It seems a bit wasteful but then, just\n  dying doesn\'t mean you\'re not in the show any more.\n  <i>Gwendoline Christie</i>\'s character, <i>Larissa Weems</i>, Nevermore\'s\n  Principal in Season 1 died but now she\'s back as Wednesday\'s spirit\n  guide (She\'s great, too.) and the previous Sheriff, also killed in Season 1, makes a couple of cameo appearances in Season 2, so I wouldn\'t rule out a reappearance from any of\n  them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This is, of course, one of the things that can undermine the emotional\n  significance of... well, any plot development really, in a show like this.\n  It\'s the old horror movie problem, where no-one\'s ever really dead until\n  you\'ve seen the body. Except in fantasy, even if you\'ve seen the body burned\n  to a crisp, it doesn\'t mean whoever burned isn\'t coming back.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m long-since inured to it after a lifetime of reading comic-books.&nbsp; My\n  reactions are in the moment. They pretty much have to be if you commit to this kind of thing. I rarely find myself saying "<i>Well, that would never happen...</i>" while it\'s happening right there before me. Doubt only comes later, when I\'m\n  thinking too much as I write something like this.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After two seasons, it\'s still a little hard to figure out exactly what genre of\n  show Wednesday is supposed to be, always assuming it\'s intended to be any genre at all. It\'s a\n  fantasy-comedy-drama but also a detective show, something I had thought might\n  just be a season 1 thing but apparently is going to carry on. It\'s also\n  quite the soap opera at times and you get the feeling someone really, desperately wanted it to be a\n  romcom until they were talked out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There was some press about that in relation to Wednesday herself, when it was\n  made quite plain, coming into the second season, there was to be no more mushy stuff with\n  the title character. Probably a good decision. Wednesday needs to retain that trademark dark purity and intense focus to be recognizable as the long-established character. The slight fuzziness around the bleak edges as she\n  develops genuine friendships is already enough of a risk, without throwing\n  romance into the cauldron.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Enid picked up the romantic slack for most of the season but I was interested to\n  hear her tell <i>Agnes</i>, the one, very strong, Season 2 addition to Team\n  Wednesday (Sorry - I think I mean <i>The Nightshades</i>.) she was done with\n  boyfriends for a while. Whether that\'s a marker for the future, meaning a\n  further pullback from romantasy, or just a wobble for Enid before she gets her\n  romantic mojo back, I guess we\'ll find out next season. She\'s not going to be\n  going on many dates as an Alpha werewolf who can\'t turn back into a girl,\n  though, so there\'s that to consider.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Agnes, the human equivalent of a set of skeleton keys, makes a much better showing\n  (Ha!) in the second half of the season. I found her a little one-note in the\n  first but as she reveals just a little of her background and personality she\n  becomes considerably more interesting, not to say poignant. Her rapprochement with Enid was sweet\n  and quite touching although I\'ll miss those little spats, pitting Enid\'s\n  spluttering lupine outrage against Agnes\'s cloying, passive-aggressive sarcasm.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Pugsley </i>remains as pointless and charisma-free as ever, but since that\'s his\n  well-established personality I suppose we can\'t complain. By the end of the\n  season I was feeling slightly more sympathetic to him so there\'s some progress\n  but I could happily do without him from now on. <i>Morticia </i>and <i>Thing </i>continue as before although it was a surprise for a disembodied hand to get an actual character arc. I\'m betting <i>Lurch </i>will get one eventually. He certainly hasn\'t had a lot to do so far.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest revelation was the reason for <i>Gomez</i>\'s lack of paranormal abilities. I have always wondered just why he\'s part of the outcast world but now I have two valid explanations. Firstly, as Morticia says, it\'s a matter of attitude, not aptitude, and secondly he did used to have electrical abilities like Fester and Pugsley, so in some odd way he almost represents a disabled Outcast. All this lore fill-in is fascinating. I can take plenty more as the series goes on.</p>\n<p>\n  One thing I tried to notice was whether having an episode be directed by <i>Tim\n  Burton</i> made any appreciable difference. I\'d like to think that, if it did, I\'d\n  have been able to say afterwards which specific episodes he helmed but I\n  don\'t believe I can. I\'m looking at\n  <a href="https://timburton.fandom.com/wiki/Wednesday_episode_list#Season_Two_(2025)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the credits</span></a>\n  now and I see he directed the final two, which I did think were the\n  strongest of the whole season, but I\'m not sure how much that had to do with\n  the direction as opposed to them just being the climactic drawing-together of\n  all the plot points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And those plot points were tied up neatly enough, if not with a pretty little bow. There\n  were a few loose ends left dangling here and there but only enough to give the\n  writers of Season 3 something to grab onto. I found the whole thing a deal\n  more satisfying than I expected after what felt like a relatively baggy and\n  incoherent first half.\n</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>It does make me wonder how smart an idea it was to split the season in the\n  first place. I realize it was done for commercial rather than aesthetic\n  reasons but in retrospect I wonder if it might have had the opposite effect\n  from what was intended. I can imagine a few Wednesday fans feeling somewhat\n  less invested after watching episodes one through four, left perhaps not as excited\n  as they could have been for the rest.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  If the whole thing had either dropped week on week for a couple of months or\n  landed in a big, binge-friendly block, I suspect the story arcs might have\n  felt more coherent (Or noticeable, even.) and the sense of anti-climax that\n  came with the end of the first half might not have been felt, or felt so\n  strongly. It\'ll be interesting to see if Netflix goes the same way next time.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, that\'s likely to be at least a year from now. It\'s a long time to\n  wait, isn\'t it? I don\'t think I used to notice these lengthy gaps so much back\n  when all TV was broadcast in real time. Now, in the age of on-demand\n  entertainment, it does feel very strange to have to wait so long.</p>\n<p>\n  In the mean-time, though, there\'s apparently an Uncle Fester spin-off in the\n  works. Too much to hope it\'ll be that Fester/Wednesday double act I was\n  wishing for earlier. (When I wrote that yesterday I didn\'t know about the\n  spin-off, either...) but I\'ll take it as it comes and gratefully.\n</p>\n<p>To conclude, as a whole, I was happy with Wednesday Season 2. I\'d like to re-watch it\n  without the hiatus to see if it does, in fact, hold together better that way.\n  But not right now.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have a lot going on, as you might tell from the reduced output here at the\n  moment. This should have posted yesterday, neatly on a Wednesday, but outside\n  factors intervened as I imagine they will continue to do for the foreseeable future. I might have to miss more than the odd post. Or maybe not. We\'ll see how things go.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>\n  </p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPLAjDaHDeHaZZ_xT2c0Hn93W5zQpRQAVblNSky9W6M6Bhw8zv43ifDzqI_V4iResRvLUHfoFgg_j73cE8FyW1a4N8WUpPgbI2YOVDjDuDw5c5o06UqgLpG7ri4rINCdcfKxTAmN7d6avj4QuBt1IBTFzXhTgIl8IXFTtKSdgzjS3TABkHUG_OCbaMo5A/s1827/wedrr1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="334" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPLAjDaHDeHaZZ_xT2c0Hn93W5zQpRQAVblNSky9W6M6Bhw8zv43ifDzqI_V4iResRvLUHfoFgg_j73cE8FyW1a4N8WUpPgbI2YOVDjDuDw5c5o06UqgLpG7ri4rINCdcfKxTAmN7d6avj4QuBt1IBTFzXhTgIl8IXFTtKSdgzjS3TABkHUG_OCbaMo5A/w640-h334/wedrr1.png" width="640" /></a></div>It doesn\'t say much for my observational skills or my critical faculties that\n  it was only a couple of minutes ago, when the title of this post popped into\n  my head, that I realized why every episode of <i>Wednesday\'</i>s second season\n  is some kind of pun on the word "<i>woe</i>".

I don\'t really\n  know her well from any of her other work, although obviously I know of it and\n  did before the show even aired, so in my mind the Wednesday Addams character\n  and the actor playing her were mostly interchangeable.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When the most important thing you have to do as an actor is maintain almost\n  the exact same expression and tone of voice throughout, it makes it quite hard for\n  an audience to realize just how much work you\'re doing. With Enid inhabiting\n  her, Wednesday was free to laugh, smile, talk in something other than a\n  monotone and even move her arms as she walked. Or, I should say, skipped!\n</p>\n<p>\n  The opening of that episode, where Enid-as-Wednesday is in full KPop dance\n  mode, is a great shock start and one of the rare times the trope of starting\n  the story at the end (Well, the middle in this case.) and then tossing up the\n  "<i>16 hours Earlier</i>" interstitial actually worked. Honestly, it felt genuinely outrageous. I was ready to be outraged. And then I was charmed and\n  delighted instead, which is a pretty fine bait&amp;switch if you can pull it\n  off.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Speaking of Enid, she gets far more to do in the second half of the season.\n  Oh, sure, she\'s in the first four episodes, all the time, but she doesn\'t know\n  what\'s going on and the atmosphere between her and Wednesday is sour and it\n  never feels comfortable. I know, I know... Wednesday isn\'t supposed to be\n  cosy. But still, you want the team to pull together, don\'t you? I do, anyway.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  <i>Emma Myers</i> is excellent as Enid as always and her story arc develops in a very\n  interesting fashion. As with everything in the show - and in most fantasy\n  shows if we\'re going to be sensible about it - a lot of things don\'t bear\n  close examination. I\'m not entirely convinced by the Alpha lore, or perhaps\n  it\'s the naming convention that\'s confusing. Wouldn\'t the Alpha be the\n  dominant pack member? Why would the pack shun their Alpha, let alone hunt her down and\n  kill her?\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  That, however, may all be explained at some future stage, most likely in\n  Season 3, since the really excellent ending of Season 2 sets everything up for just that. And since I\'ve mentioned it already I\'ll take the end out of order. I just\n  loved it and I can tell you exactly why.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For one thing it\'s a set-up, not a cliffhanger. It\'s the best way to go out of\n  a season, leaving your audience excited for what might come next, rather than\n  frustrated because something got cut off in mid-flow.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  For another, it\'s a very open-ended set-up. It\'s entirely possible the third\n  season of Wednesday might not be set in Nevermore Academy at all. All those\n  problems with the students starting to look like they really ought to be doing\n  post-grad work just fall away if the school setting isn\'t there as a\n  backdrop.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And for the third and possibly best thing (Apologies to the actual <i>Thing</i>.) it brings back\n  <i>Uncle Fester</i> along with the delicious possibility of a prolonged\n  Wednesday-Fester double act. I\'d take a whole spin-off series of that.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Season 3 could be a wilderness adventure, a road-trip or pretty much anything.\n  Or it could be a pre-credit sequence, then back to Nevermore. For\n  that matter, Season 3 could take place entirely in the summer break and Season\n  4 could be the start of the next academic year.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I hope not, though, and I\'m not sure Nevermore is even still in business, anyway.\n  There\'s one line in the last episode, I forget who\'s speaking, where someone\n  clearly suggests the school has closed. Possibly for good.</p><p>For that matter, I was never sure just\n  how much of the school year had passed by the end of Season 2. All the parents turn up and everyone goes home but is that the end of the Fall\n  semester or has a whole year gone round? Or have they all just turned up to\n  take the kids away because&nbsp;the place is on fire and the Principal has just been publicly exposed as a murdering con-man?</p>\n<p>\n  Oh, yeah, and he\'s dead, too. The Principal, that is. And one of the\n  teachers. And there\'s a dead Hyde on the werewolf statue. And a couple more\n  people died earlier. It\'s a bloodbath (Except blood is one thing you never\n  seem to see - it\'s a very not-gory show, oddly.)\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Throughout the season but mainly in Part 2, a lot of people die, including a\n  whole bunch of major supporting characters played by famous guest actors.\n  <i>Steve Buscemi, Christina Ricci, Christopher Lloyd</i>... It seems a bit wasteful but then, just\n  dying doesn\'t mean you\'re not in the show any more.\n  <i>Gwendoline Christie</i>\'s character, <i>Larissa Weems</i>, Nevermore\'s\n  Principal in Season 1 died but now she\'s back as Wednesday\'s spirit\n  guide (She\'s great, too.) and the previous Sheriff, also killed in Season 1, makes a couple of cameo appearances in Season 2, so I wouldn\'t rule out a reappearance from any of\n  them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This is, of course, one of the things that can undermine the emotional\n  significance of... well, any plot development really, in a show like this.\n  It\'s the old horror movie problem, where no-one\'s ever really dead until\n  you\'ve seen the body. Except in fantasy, even if you\'ve seen the body burned\n  to a crisp, it doesn\'t mean whoever burned isn\'t coming back.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m long-since inured to it after a lifetime of reading comic-books.&nbsp; My\n  reactions are in the moment. They pretty much have to be if you commit to this kind of thing. I rarely find myself saying "<i>Well, that would never happen...</i>" while it\'s happening right there before me. Doubt only comes later, when I\'m\n  thinking too much as I write something like this.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After two seasons, it\'s still a little hard to figure out exactly what genre of\n  show Wednesday is supposed to be, always assuming it\'s intended to be any genre at all. It\'s a\n  fantasy-comedy-drama but also a detective show, something I had thought might\n  just be a season 1 thing but apparently is going to carry on. It\'s also\n  quite the soap opera at times and you get the feeling someone really, desperately wanted it to be a\n  romcom until they were talked out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There was some press about that in relation to Wednesday herself, when it was\n  made quite plain, coming into the second season, there was to be no more mushy stuff with\n  the title character. Probably a good decision. Wednesday needs to retain that trademark dark purity and intense focus to be recognizable as the long-established character. The slight fuzziness around the bleak edges as she\n  develops genuine friendships is already enough of a risk, without throwing\n  romance into the cauldron.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Enid picked up the romantic slack for most of the season but I was interested to\n  hear her tell <i>Agnes</i>, the one, very strong, Season 2 addition to Team\n  Wednesday (Sorry - I think I mean <i>The Nightshades</i>.) she was done with\n  boyfriends for a while. Whether that\'s a marker for the future, meaning a\n  further pullback from romantasy, or just a wobble for Enid before she gets her\n  romantic mojo back, I guess we\'ll find out next season. She\'s not going to be\n  going on many dates as an Alpha werewolf who can\'t turn back into a girl,\n  though, so there\'s that to consider.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Agnes, the human equivalent of a set of skeleton keys, makes a much better showing\n  (Ha!) in the second half of the season. I found her a little one-note in the\n  first but as she reveals just a little of her background and personality she\n  becomes considerably more interesting, not to say poignant. Her rapprochement with Enid was sweet\n  and quite touching although I\'ll miss those little spats, pitting Enid\'s\n  spluttering lupine outrage against Agnes\'s cloying, passive-aggressive sarcasm.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Pugsley </i>remains as pointless and charisma-free as ever, but since that\'s his\n  well-established personality I suppose we can\'t complain. By the end of the\n  season I was feeling slightly more sympathetic to him so there\'s some progress\n  but I could happily do without him from now on. <i>Morticia </i>and <i>Thing </i>continue as before although it was a surprise for a disembodied hand to get an actual character arc. I\'m betting <i>Lurch </i>will get one eventually. He certainly hasn\'t had a lot to do so far.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest revelation was the reason for <i>Gomez</i>\'s lack of paranormal abilities. I have always wondered just why he\'s part of the outcast world but now I have two valid explanations. Firstly, as Morticia says, it\'s a matter of attitude, not aptitude, and secondly he did used to have electrical abilities like Fester and Pugsley, so in some odd way he almost represents a disabled Outcast. All this lore fill-in is fascinating. I can take plenty more as the series goes on.</p>\n<p>\n  One thing I tried to notice was whether having an episode be directed by <i>Tim\n  Burton</i> made any appreciable difference. I\'d like to think that, if it did, I\'d\n  have been able to say afterwards which specific episodes he helmed but I\n  don\'t believe I can. I\'m looking at\n  <a href="https://timburton.fandom.com/wiki/Wednesday_episode_list#Season_Two_(2025)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the credits</span></a>\n  now and I see he directed the final two, which I did think were the\n  strongest of the whole season, but I\'m not sure how much that had to do with\n  the direction as opposed to them just being the climactic drawing-together of\n  all the plot points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And those plot points were tied up neatly enough, if not with a pretty little bow. There\n  were a few loose ends left dangling here and there but only enough to give the\n  writers of Season 3 something to grab onto. I found the whole thing a deal\n  more satisfying than I expected after what felt like a relatively baggy and\n  incoherent first half.\n</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>It does make me wonder how smart an idea it was to split the season in the\n  first place. I realize it was done for commercial rather than aesthetic\n  reasons but in retrospect I wonder if it might have had the opposite effect\n  from what was intended. I can imagine a few Wednesday fans feeling somewhat\n  less invested after watching episodes one through four, left perhaps not as excited\n  as they could have been for the rest.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  If the whole thing had either dropped week on week for a couple of months or\n  landed in a big, binge-friendly block, I suspect the story arcs might have\n  felt more coherent (Or noticeable, even.) and the sense of anti-climax that\n  came with the end of the first half might not have been felt, or felt so\n  strongly. It\'ll be interesting to see if Netflix goes the same way next time.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, that\'s likely to be at least a year from now. It\'s a long time to\n  wait, isn\'t it? I don\'t think I used to notice these lengthy gaps so much back\n  when all TV was broadcast in real time. Now, in the age of on-demand\n  entertainment, it does feel very strange to have to wait so long.</p>\n<p>\n  In the mean-time, though, there\'s apparently an Uncle Fester spin-off in the\n  works. Too much to hope it\'ll be that Fester/Wednesday double act I was\n  wishing for earlier. (When I wrote that yesterday I didn\'t know about the\n  spin-off, either...) but I\'ll take it as it comes and gratefully.\n</p>\n<p>To conclude, as a whole, I was happy with Wednesday Season 2. I\'d like to re-watch it\n  without the hiatus to see if it does, in fact, hold together better that way.\n  But not right now.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have a lot going on, as you might tell from the reduced output here at the\n  moment. This should have posted yesterday, neatly on a Wednesday, but outside\n  factors intervened as I imagine they will continue to do for the foreseeable future. I might have to miss more than the odd post. Or maybe not. We\'ll see how things go.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/wednesdays-child.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/wednesdays-child.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPLAjDaHDeHaZZ_xT2c0Hn93W5zQpRQAVblNSky9W6M6Bhw8zv43ifDzqI_V4iResRvLUHfoFgg_j73cE8FyW1a4N8WUpPgbI2YOVDjDuDw5c5o06UqgLpG7ri4rINCdcfKxTAmN7d6avj4QuBt1IBTFzXhTgIl8IXFTtKSdgzjS3TABkHUG_OCbaMo5A/s72-w640-h334-c/wedrr1.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '7'}

As her close on sixty played days suggests, she got out quite a bit. Also, if this series didn\'t have an established format for the titles, I\'d definitely have called this post Born On The Fourth Of July.</p><p>One thing this series has taught me, as if I didn\'t know it already, is that my memory is shot. Even that suggests it was ever any good to begin with, which it most certainly wasn\'t. I have always had a bad memory and waiting a couple of decades to write anything down sure isn\'t making it any better.</p><p>It\'d be lovely if I could say for sure why I decided to roll up a new character on July the fourth, 2004, which would have been very close to the end of my second stint playing <i>EQ </i>as my main MMORPG. To recap a little, the first run lasted from November 1999 to whenever <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i> went live (9 October 2001) and the second from about six months after that until I got into the <i>EverQuest II</i> beta sometime around the end of August or the start of September 2004.</p><p>There was a third substantive phase that began when <i>EQII </i>puttered out about six months after launch, a fourth around the time of the&nbsp;<i>Serpent\'s Spine</i> expansion in September 2006, (That was the expansion that was intended to re-boot the franchise and nearly succeeded) and a fifth and final hurrah, at least as any kind of group player, when <i>Seeds of Destruction</i> arrived in October 2008, bringing with it the game-changing Mercenary feature.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, I\'ve been back a good few times, occasionally for quite long runs lasting several months, but always as a solo player. After I created Ratha in June 2004, though, I never again felt the need to start over from scratch with a brand new character, or at least not one that stuck. I may well roll the final five names on this list into a single post because there won\'t be much to say about any of them.</p><p>Ratha, though, has a very substantial history. And if I could remember it, I\'d tell you what it was. Here\'s what I do remember...</p><p>Her name, for a start. She\'s named after the central character in a novel called <i>Ratha\'s Creature</i>&nbsp;by <i>Clare Bell</i>, the first in a series of novels collectively known as "<i><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_the_Named">The Books of the Named</a></span></i>". She\'s a sentient, prehistoric great cat, who learns how to use fire, so you can see why I went there.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4kbaA8Wj8dYsJavGnYECHIDhHTvf2LsSzhLv8ptWqlc6vzhOShmK6_WVxkiyZtXt-EDks3RD8BLXJ8Yh3zMShueM-PyQ4TL1BF0uzZ_eisENgGBTaiQE9QeOaf28bcmjE-yEsBf96SAfzXvQNNLcZvH0Cf84hXPWj-QjhRLC3Iy7nFo45XytWhIFmdU8/s1487/eqratha2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="306" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4kbaA8Wj8dYsJavGnYECHIDhHTvf2LsSzhLv8ptWqlc6vzhOShmK6_WVxkiyZtXt-EDks3RD8BLXJ8Yh3zMShueM-PyQ4TL1BF0uzZ_eisENgGBTaiQE9QeOaf28bcmjE-yEsBf96SAfzXvQNNLcZvH0Cf84hXPWj-QjhRLC3Iy7nFo45XytWhIFmdU8/w640-h306/eqratha2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>There are five books in the series, published sporadically between 1983 and 2008. I used to review books for a semi-pro comics zine back in the eighties, which is how I got hold of the first and second books in the series. They were review copies. I still have them and they made a big impression on me at the time although not so much that I\'ve re-read either of them since or hunted down the three remaining volumes.&nbsp;<p></p><p>Looking at them online now, I\'m not too surprised to see they\'re all out of print (Although you can get them all on Kindle.) but more so to find they\'re quite collectable. I\'ll have to see if I can complete my set and finish the story.</p><p>As usual with just about every name I\'ve ever given a character in any game, no-one sent me any tells saying they recognized the name or commented on it in any way. There seems to be very little common ground between the kind of books I read and the tastes of people who play these kinds of games. Which, of course, makes those books ideal sources for naming characters.</p><p>So that\'s why she\'s called Ratha. As for why she\'s a Beastlord, not too long before, we\'d been spending a great deal of time grouped with an Eastern European guy around college age, young for our crowd, whose name I forget although I have a feeling it will come back to me <span style="font-size: x-small;">[Edit - it didn\'t.]</span> so I\'d had plenty of opportunities to study the Beastlord gameplay as it was then. And boy was it OP!</p><p>A lot of EQ players strongly disapproved of Beastlords when they were introduced. The pushback was a factor in why the class didn\'t carry over into EQII, only being added there years later.</p><p>They were widely seen as easy-mode upstarts, created by the devs as some kind of sop to the idea that EQ was too difficult - too difficult to play solo and too difficult to get groups, both of which problems Beastlords seemed designed to fix.</p><p>Beastlords could do lots of things other classes could do, making them almost as good all-rounders as Norrath\'s famous jacks-of-all-trades, Bards.&nbsp;The big difference was you needed a lot of skill to play a Bard but any fool could play a Beastlord. That was their reputation, anyway. And it was half-way true. Having spent a lot of time with a couple of the best bards on the server, I knew what an incredible class it was but also how much chance I had of playing one well - none. The Beastlord, though, looked manageable.&nbsp;</p><p>It also looked far more nuanced and interesting than its bad reputation suggested. Played competently, let alone well, a Beastlord could tank, heal, buff, handle crowd control and provide decent dps both at range and in melee. There was always something for a Beastlord to do in almost any situation or any group make-up. Shamans hated them for it because they did everything people wanted a Shaman for - not as well but well enough for most groups - and a lot more besides.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy8sJyqJe0vQUUFo6-gh4hUvlXqBzrVk0F-z4wXmOGSsnt1ckn3-EbRUdIuR4ZTYF1-e8kcos6E_ctXXkCzHc0srcA165jDl76U-mlldpvgo1n_T458KbJ-99Px8mL9cR0dycJKtEtL-Pm7IDLDywKseaJdDEPxR4rteuaN42u6gInWqEKJkDKION7Y2M/s1920/eqratha3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy8sJyqJe0vQUUFo6-gh4hUvlXqBzrVk0F-z4wXmOGSsnt1ckn3-EbRUdIuR4ZTYF1-e8kcos6E_ctXXkCzHc0srcA165jDl76U-mlldpvgo1n_T458KbJ-99Px8mL9cR0dycJKtEtL-Pm7IDLDywKseaJdDEPxR4rteuaN42u6gInWqEKJkDKION7Y2M/w640-h342/eqratha3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>As I\'d seen, though, since we frequently played in groups with a top-class Shaman, the two classes were perfectly able to sync if the players were willing. But then, in those happy days most of the players I grouped with regularly were both skilled and socially competent. I know! Hard to believe, isn\'t it? Shame it didn\'t last.<p></p><p>I do remember that those were my reasons for making a Beastlord. I just don\'t recall now why I needed a new character at all. Just looking at the dates, it\'s unlikely verging on impossible that whatever it was Ratha was meant to do ever got done. Not unless it only took a couple of months and in those days very little in EQ took as little time as that.</p><p>What actually happened that summer before the beta is lost to time but afterwards, when Mrs Bhagpuss and I finally abandoned the listing wreck that was EQII six months post-launch and returned to the safe harbor of the original EQ, literally no-one we knew there was still playing. They\'d all left for... who knows? We only ever saw one of them again.</p><p>For that and other reasons, we declined to pick up where we left off on our established characters and instead started playing new ones. I\'ve already written about our times on <i>Stromm</i>, which I remember relatively clearly, but how Ratha fits in is much more cloudy. She might also have been on Stromm for a while but if so I\'ve forgotten about it.</p><p>What I remember very clearly are the times I spent playing her in a duo with Mrs Bhagpuss. We had a good go at <i>Depths of Darkhollow</i>, the September 2005 expansion that all happens underground and we did a lot of the Serpents Spine<i> </i>expansion together. Ratha was my main character for both of those. I think we got to about Level 50 in <i>TSS</i>, probably stopping before we got to the end of<i> Goruka Mesa</i>, a zone that goes to the mid-fifities.</p><p>When we came back for our final duo tour in Seeds of Destruction three years later, it was for a hugely enjoyable romp through dozens of zones that had previoulsy been far out of our range.

By the starter zone of <i>Secrets of Faydwer</i>, the expansion immediately preceding <i>SoD</i>, our levels had almost caught up with the cap and we had to play properly. Duoing was still practical and fun but it was clear we weren\'t going to get much further and knuckling down to grind out a few per cent of a level each session, while taking care not to get killed, wasn\'t nearly as much fun as romping across whole zones leaving a trail of smoking corpses in our wake.</p><p>That was the last time we visited Norrath together. We moved on to duo in several more MMORPGs, eventually settling down for another decade in <i>Guild Wars 2</i>. Mrs. Bhagpuss is probably done with MMORPGs now, after two full decades playing them pretty heavily. I continue to pick away at the genre, albeit with considerably less enthusiasm these days.</p><p>As for EverQuest, as I said, I\'ve been back plenty of times since that final run in Seeds of Destruction. As I recall, the first time I returned alone, I did pick Ratha back up in the expectation of adding a few levels. She did get a couple more but, while she\'s a competent soloist with a mercenary behind her, it seemed awfully slow compared to what I\'d been used to doing with her. It didn\'t last.</p><p>She ended up, beached in the mid-80s (Like a lot of us...) I did think about using last year\'s free Level 100 boost on her but there\'s not really much point. I would never play her and if I was going to boost anyone it\'d probably be my Necromancer... who we\'ll meet next time.&nbsp;</p><p>Didn\'t I already have a Necro, though? <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/08/7-nickolai-born-9-march-2000-29-days-1.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">I did!</span></a> Well remembered!

As her close on sixty played days suggests, she got out quite a bit. Also, if this series didn\'t have an established format for the titles, I\'d definitely have called this post Born On The Fourth Of July.</p><p>One thing this series has taught me, as if I didn\'t know it already, is that my memory is shot. Even that suggests it was ever any good to begin with, which it most certainly wasn\'t. I have always had a bad memory and waiting a couple of decades to write anything down sure isn\'t making it any better.</p><p>It\'d be lovely if I could say for sure why I decided to roll up a new character on July the fourth, 2004, which would have been very close to the end of my second stint playing <i>EQ </i>as my main MMORPG. To recap a little, the first run lasted from November 1999 to whenever <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i> went live (9 October 2001) and the second from about six months after that until I got into the <i>EverQuest II</i> beta sometime around the end of August or the start of September 2004.</p><p>There was a third substantive phase that began when <i>EQII </i>puttered out about six months after launch, a fourth around the time of the&nbsp;<i>Serpent\'s Spine</i> expansion in September 2006, (That was the expansion that was intended to re-boot the franchise and nearly succeeded) and a fifth and final hurrah, at least as any kind of group player, when <i>Seeds of Destruction</i> arrived in October 2008, bringing with it the game-changing Mercenary feature.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, I\'ve been back a good few times, occasionally for quite long runs lasting several months, but always as a solo player. After I created Ratha in June 2004, though, I never again felt the need to start over from scratch with a brand new character, or at least not one that stuck. I may well roll the final five names on this list into a single post because there won\'t be much to say about any of them.</p><p>Ratha, though, has a very substantial history. And if I could remember it, I\'d tell you what it was. Here\'s what I do remember...</p><p>Her name, for a start. She\'s named after the central character in a novel called <i>Ratha\'s Creature</i>&nbsp;by <i>Clare Bell</i>, the first in a series of novels collectively known as "<i><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_the_Named">The Books of the Named</a></span></i>". She\'s a sentient, prehistoric great cat, who learns how to use fire, so you can see why I went there.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4kbaA8Wj8dYsJavGnYECHIDhHTvf2LsSzhLv8ptWqlc6vzhOShmK6_WVxkiyZtXt-EDks3RD8BLXJ8Yh3zMShueM-PyQ4TL1BF0uzZ_eisENgGBTaiQE9QeOaf28bcmjE-yEsBf96SAfzXvQNNLcZvH0Cf84hXPWj-QjhRLC3Iy7nFo45XytWhIFmdU8/s1487/eqratha2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="306" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4kbaA8Wj8dYsJavGnYECHIDhHTvf2LsSzhLv8ptWqlc6vzhOShmK6_WVxkiyZtXt-EDks3RD8BLXJ8Yh3zMShueM-PyQ4TL1BF0uzZ_eisENgGBTaiQE9QeOaf28bcmjE-yEsBf96SAfzXvQNNLcZvH0Cf84hXPWj-QjhRLC3Iy7nFo45XytWhIFmdU8/w640-h306/eqratha2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>There are five books in the series, published sporadically between 1983 and 2008. I used to review books for a semi-pro comics zine back in the eighties, which is how I got hold of the first and second books in the series. They were review copies. I still have them and they made a big impression on me at the time although not so much that I\'ve re-read either of them since or hunted down the three remaining volumes.&nbsp;<p></p><p>Looking at them online now, I\'m not too surprised to see they\'re all out of print (Although you can get them all on Kindle.) but more so to find they\'re quite collectable. I\'ll have to see if I can complete my set and finish the story.</p><p>As usual with just about every name I\'ve ever given a character in any game, no-one sent me any tells saying they recognized the name or commented on it in any way. There seems to be very little common ground between the kind of books I read and the tastes of people who play these kinds of games. Which, of course, makes those books ideal sources for naming characters.</p><p>So that\'s why she\'s called Ratha. As for why she\'s a Beastlord, not too long before, we\'d been spending a great deal of time grouped with an Eastern European guy around college age, young for our crowd, whose name I forget although I have a feeling it will come back to me <span style="font-size: x-small;">[Edit - it didn\'t.]</span> so I\'d had plenty of opportunities to study the Beastlord gameplay as it was then. And boy was it OP!</p><p>A lot of EQ players strongly disapproved of Beastlords when they were introduced. The pushback was a factor in why the class didn\'t carry over into EQII, only being added there years later.</p><p>They were widely seen as easy-mode upstarts, created by the devs as some kind of sop to the idea that EQ was too difficult - too difficult to play solo and too difficult to get groups, both of which problems Beastlords seemed designed to fix.</p><p>Beastlords could do lots of things other classes could do, making them almost as good all-rounders as Norrath\'s famous jacks-of-all-trades, Bards.&nbsp;The big difference was you needed a lot of skill to play a Bard but any fool could play a Beastlord. That was their reputation, anyway. And it was half-way true. Having spent a lot of time with a couple of the best bards on the server, I knew what an incredible class it was but also how much chance I had of playing one well - none. The Beastlord, though, looked manageable.&nbsp;</p><p>It also looked far more nuanced and interesting than its bad reputation suggested. Played competently, let alone well, a Beastlord could tank, heal, buff, handle crowd control and provide decent dps both at range and in melee. There was always something for a Beastlord to do in almost any situation or any group make-up. Shamans hated them for it because they did everything people wanted a Shaman for - not as well but well enough for most groups - and a lot more besides.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy8sJyqJe0vQUUFo6-gh4hUvlXqBzrVk0F-z4wXmOGSsnt1ckn3-EbRUdIuR4ZTYF1-e8kcos6E_ctXXkCzHc0srcA165jDl76U-mlldpvgo1n_T458KbJ-99Px8mL9cR0dycJKtEtL-Pm7IDLDywKseaJdDEPxR4rteuaN42u6gInWqEKJkDKION7Y2M/s1920/eqratha3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy8sJyqJe0vQUUFo6-gh4hUvlXqBzrVk0F-z4wXmOGSsnt1ckn3-EbRUdIuR4ZTYF1-e8kcos6E_ctXXkCzHc0srcA165jDl76U-mlldpvgo1n_T458KbJ-99Px8mL9cR0dycJKtEtL-Pm7IDLDywKseaJdDEPxR4rteuaN42u6gInWqEKJkDKION7Y2M/w640-h342/eqratha3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>As I\'d seen, though, since we frequently played in groups with a top-class Shaman, the two classes were perfectly able to sync if the players were willing. But then, in those happy days most of the players I grouped with regularly were both skilled and socially competent. I know! Hard to believe, isn\'t it? Shame it didn\'t last.<p></p><p>I do remember that those were my reasons for making a Beastlord. I just don\'t recall now why I needed a new character at all. Just looking at the dates, it\'s unlikely verging on impossible that whatever it was Ratha was meant to do ever got done. Not unless it only took a couple of months and in those days very little in EQ took as little time as that.</p><p>What actually happened that summer before the beta is lost to time but afterwards, when Mrs Bhagpuss and I finally abandoned the listing wreck that was EQII six months post-launch and returned to the safe harbor of the original EQ, literally no-one we knew there was still playing. They\'d all left for... who knows? We only ever saw one of them again.</p><p>For that and other reasons, we declined to pick up where we left off on our established characters and instead started playing new ones. I\'ve already written about our times on <i>Stromm</i>, which I remember relatively clearly, but how Ratha fits in is much more cloudy. She might also have been on Stromm for a while but if so I\'ve forgotten about it.</p><p>What I remember very clearly are the times I spent playing her in a duo with Mrs Bhagpuss. We had a good go at <i>Depths of Darkhollow</i>, the September 2005 expansion that all happens underground and we did a lot of the Serpents Spine<i> </i>expansion together. Ratha was my main character for both of those. I think we got to about Level 50 in <i>TSS</i>, probably stopping before we got to the end of<i> Goruka Mesa</i>, a zone that goes to the mid-fifities.</p><p>When we came back for our final duo tour in Seeds of Destruction three years later, it was for a hugely enjoyable romp through dozens of zones that had previoulsy been far out of our range.

How shows get dropped after one season if they\nhaven\'t picked up traction. How multi-season arcs just fall right off that cliff\nthey thought they were hanging onto, leaving everyone who cared high and dry and\nwondering what the hell happened. Shows with decent ratings get canned because\nsomething else might do better or come to a juddering halt because one of the\nleads did something the platform doesn\'t want to be associated with.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  It\'s not like the old networks were more forgiving or responsible or\n  artistically committed. If anything they were worse in all respects but they\n  were also slower, steadier, less flighty. They did drop shows fast if they\n  didn\'t pick up an audience but first they\'d shunt them around the schedules a\n  bit and maybe try a second season with a new theme tune and title sequence to\n  see if there was any movement. And they always had the holy grail of\n  syndication in the distance so there was some motivation to keep the momentum\n  going, once they\'d gotten the train rolling.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was a real surprise to see news reports predicting\n  <i>"<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/wednesday-could-run-for-seven-seasons-with-netflix-planning-top-secret-spin-off-3880520"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Wednesday could run for seven seasons</span></a></i>". Not only is that very specific, it seems counter to any previous logic.\n  Shows last as long as they hold an audience, keep their stars and someone\n  crucial to the production process doesn\'t get a better offer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And seven seasons of Wednesday, with the slight evidence of just two seasons\n  to go on, wouldn\'t mean even seven years, which would itself be a\n  <i>long </i>time in streaming culture. The show first arrived on\n  <i>Netflix </i>in November 2022 and the second part of the second season has\n  just aired, almost three years later. If they can\'t speed that up, completing\n  seven seasons of Wednesday would take a couple of decades! The students of\n  <i>Nevermore Academy</i> are going to look about as convincing as teenagers as\n  the cast of <i>Grease</i>! by then.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But I\'m not here today to talk about Wednesday. I haven\'t started on the\n  second half of the new season yet. (By the way, as an aside,\n  <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/wednesday-addams-half-term-report.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the post</span></a>\n  I did on the first half of the season was the least-read of all the posts I\n  published during Blaugust, according to Blogger\'s page-view stats, which I\n  find fairly reliable. By quite some margin, too. Given the supposed popularity\n  of the show, that seemed surprising, until it occured to me maybe people\n  didn\'t even click on it in fear of spoilers.

And no, I\'m not going to drop any big reveals of the plot\nor the details but I am going to give away the emotional tenor of the ending. It\nwas good. It felt satisfying. It had some light and shade and a little more\nnuance than perhaps I was expecting.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  In fact, I\'d go so far as to say the production team and the writers have left\n  themselves just enough wriggle room to carry the whole thing on at some\n  unspecified time in the future, if the opportunity arises. It wouldn\'t be the\n  first time a show with a planned ending turned out not to have ended after\n  all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Assuming that doesn\'t happen, though, I\'d imagine most viewers will feel they\n  can live with the way it finished. It\'s mostly a happy ending. Most of the\n  characters you like get to walk off into the sunset with the love of their\n  life (Not that all of those loves can actually walk...) The bad guys get\n  what\'s coming to them, or some of them do, at least. I was very happy with the\n  resolution of Ingrid\'s arc, she being my favorite character. I wouldn\'t have\n  predicted it after Season One, either, so that\'s a gold star to the writers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As for the plot, in keeping with the entire series, none of it really bears\n  close examination. Or casual examination. Any examination at all, really. If I\n  started picking holes, we\'d be here \'til Christmas. But none of that matters.\n  If you start with an unrealistic proposition, everything you build on that\n  foundation is bound to fall apart if you lean on it. So don\'t lean on it is my\n  advice.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just lean back and enjoy it. Let it wash over you and pick what sense out of\n  it you can. It\'s stuffed full of topical references and tiny satires that\n  spill out all over the plot for no good reason so why not just indulge\n  yourself?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRYYNPvhD3SWveaYirjXXPaB02p4mWFVXCZj1UWuLgwrJgGqYVZ-Vcm99xH4blbTLWDehK7TcH6WAuqy2YkJNCjHDDyJ3MAJ8tRbsBz3BKvH6Fc4YPqAgNk7WqeZ0eDgL0pjD_hFl2ck0jO-aw09Mogg8jh9zp2I51EJu9CwxvxKm59WybMzCggOatAcs/s1032/upload4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="318" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRYYNPvhD3SWveaYirjXXPaB02p4mWFVXCZj1UWuLgwrJgGqYVZ-Vcm99xH4blbTLWDehK7TcH6WAuqy2YkJNCjHDDyJ3MAJ8tRbsBz3BKvH6Fc4YPqAgNk7WqeZ0eDgL0pjD_hFl2ck0jO-aw09Mogg8jh9zp2I51EJu9CwxvxKm59WybMzCggOatAcs/w640-h318/upload4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nI\'ll just mention one of those: the Millennial references. They stood out for\nme. I hadn\'t even tried to date the whole thng until then. It\'s in "<i>the future</i>" but if they\'d ever said how far I\'d missed it. This time, though, there were\na couple of scenes with some very specific data points, namely that the central\ncharacters, all of whom seem to be in their thirties (<i>Ingrid</i>,\nspecifically, is thirty-four in the final episode. <i>Nathan</i>, according to\n<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upload_(TV_series)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Wikipedia</span></a></i>, was 27 when the series began.) have Millenials for parents.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  On the most commonly-used generational timeline, the last Millennials would\n  have been born by 1996. The children of Millennials, for the most part, are\n  Gen Alpha, for which as yet there is no agreed date-range but which is broadly\n  seen as covering the 2010s to about now. Even the oldest Gen Alpha wouldn\'t be\n  hitting thirty until around the middle of the century and most of them will\n  get there after 2050.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which doesn\'t seem that crazy. I\'m so used to everything set in "<i>the future</i>" seeming to imagine decades of technological development telescoped into a\n  few years that it seems strange to see extrapolations from current experiments\n  being given something approximating a reasonable development arc. We\n  <i>could </i>have self-driving cars, digital brain scans and sentient AI by\n  the 2050s or 2060s. All of that is being worked on right now. I mean, we\n  <i>won\'t</i> but it\'s not like saying we\'ll have terraformed Mars or perfected\n  matter transmission by then.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, that\'s Upload for you. A very enjoyable show, often funny, sometimes\n  exciting, always heart-warming, never made a lot of sense. I did tear up a\n  little, right at the end, even though the final scene had been telegraphed for\n  most of the last episode.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I\'m sorry to see it end but I\'m very happy to see it end so well.&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXluv_-OvHZfrcVsR0E2I-UnJD_3-6QQ-8smCZ7JC3PdBKcSLVmCnXeFnpcCrrPcgDWoPC-svX2L0F-qP4byvAoKOdBVptTQnyBZF-aeKqhDxUXWulSqeX9x9jL3aWVMAeUvZ2uSi14S_FDzmC96UBTRd1xHzbgYw6uCAAxHOIG_77kIe6oV36jQAmGt0/s1040/upload1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="322" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXluv_-OvHZfrcVsR0E2I-UnJD_3-6QQ-8smCZ7JC3PdBKcSLVmCnXeFnpcCrrPcgDWoPC-svX2L0F-qP4byvAoKOdBVptTQnyBZF-aeKqhDxUXWulSqeX9x9jL3aWVMAeUvZ2uSi14S_FDzmC96UBTRd1xHzbgYw6uCAAxHOIG_77kIe6oV36jQAmGt0/w640-h322/upload1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />We talk a lot around here about how poorly streaming services treat the\nproperties they represent. How shows get dropped after one season if they\nhaven\'t picked up traction. How multi-season arcs just fall right off that cliff\nthey thought they were hanging onto, leaving everyone who cared high and dry and\nwondering what the hell happened. Shows with decent ratings get canned because\nsomething else might do better or come to a juddering halt because one of the\nleads did something the platform doesn\'t want to be associated with.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  It\'s not like the old networks were more forgiving or responsible or\n  artistically committed. If anything they were worse in all respects but they\n  were also slower, steadier, less flighty. They did drop shows fast if they\n  didn\'t pick up an audience but first they\'d shunt them around the schedules a\n  bit and maybe try a second season with a new theme tune and title sequence to\n  see if there was any movement. And they always had the holy grail of\n  syndication in the distance so there was some motivation to keep the momentum\n  going, once they\'d gotten the train rolling.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was a real surprise to see news reports predicting\n  <i>"<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/wednesday-could-run-for-seven-seasons-with-netflix-planning-top-secret-spin-off-3880520"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Wednesday could run for seven seasons</span></a></i>". Not only is that very specific, it seems counter to any previous logic.\n  Shows last as long as they hold an audience, keep their stars and someone\n  crucial to the production process doesn\'t get a better offer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And seven seasons of Wednesday, with the slight evidence of just two seasons\n  to go on, wouldn\'t mean even seven years, which would itself be a\n  <i>long </i>time in streaming culture. The show first arrived on\n  <i>Netflix </i>in November 2022 and the second part of the second season has\n  just aired, almost three years later. If they can\'t speed that up, completing\n  seven seasons of Wednesday would take a couple of decades! The students of\n  <i>Nevermore Academy</i> are going to look about as convincing as teenagers as\n  the cast of <i>Grease</i>! by then.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But I\'m not here today to talk about Wednesday. I haven\'t started on the\n  second half of the new season yet. (By the way, as an aside,\n  <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/wednesday-addams-half-term-report.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the post</span></a>\n  I did on the first half of the season was the least-read of all the posts I\n  published during Blaugust, according to Blogger\'s page-view stats, which I\n  find fairly reliable. By quite some margin, too. Given the supposed popularity\n  of the show, that seemed surprising, until it occured to me maybe people\n  didn\'t even click on it in fear of spoilers. If that was you, maybe go back\n  and read it now?)\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, today\'s subject is a show that not only managed four seasons before it\n  ended but which also came to a close in a dignified, coherent and satisfying\n  fashion.

The bad guys get\n  what\'s coming to them, or some of them do, at least. I was very happy with the\n  resolution of Ingrid\'s arc, she being my favorite character. I wouldn\'t have\n  predicted it after Season One, either, so that\'s a gold star to the writers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As for the plot, in keeping with the entire series, none of it really bears\n  close examination. Or casual examination. Any examination at all, really. If I\n  started picking holes, we\'d be here \'til Christmas. But none of that matters.\n  If you start with an unrealistic proposition, everything you build on that\n  foundation is bound to fall apart if you lean on it. So don\'t lean on it is my\n  advice.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just lean back and enjoy it. Let it wash over you and pick what sense out of\n  it you can. It\'s stuffed full of topical references and tiny satires that\n  spill out all over the plot for no good reason so why not just indulge\n  yourself?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRYYNPvhD3SWveaYirjXXPaB02p4mWFVXCZj1UWuLgwrJgGqYVZ-Vcm99xH4blbTLWDehK7TcH6WAuqy2YkJNCjHDDyJ3MAJ8tRbsBz3BKvH6Fc4YPqAgNk7WqeZ0eDgL0pjD_hFl2ck0jO-aw09Mogg8jh9zp2I51EJu9CwxvxKm59WybMzCggOatAcs/s1032/upload4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="318" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRYYNPvhD3SWveaYirjXXPaB02p4mWFVXCZj1UWuLgwrJgGqYVZ-Vcm99xH4blbTLWDehK7TcH6WAuqy2YkJNCjHDDyJ3MAJ8tRbsBz3BKvH6Fc4YPqAgNk7WqeZ0eDgL0pjD_hFl2ck0jO-aw09Mogg8jh9zp2I51EJu9CwxvxKm59WybMzCggOatAcs/w640-h318/upload4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nI\'ll just mention one of those: the Millennial references. They stood out for\nme. I hadn\'t even tried to date the whole thng until then. It\'s in "<i>the future</i>" but if they\'d ever said how far I\'d missed it. This time, though, there were\na couple of scenes with some very specific data points, namely that the central\ncharacters, all of whom seem to be in their thirties (<i>Ingrid</i>,\nspecifically, is thirty-four in the final episode. <i>Nathan</i>, according to\n<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upload_(TV_series)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Wikipedia</span></a></i>, was 27 when the series began.) have Millenials for parents.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  On the most commonly-used generational timeline, the last Millennials would\n  have been born by 1996. The children of Millennials, for the most part, are\n  Gen Alpha, for which as yet there is no agreed date-range but which is broadly\n  seen as covering the 2010s to about now. Even the oldest Gen Alpha wouldn\'t be\n  hitting thirty until around the middle of the century and most of them will\n  get there after 2050.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which doesn\'t seem that crazy. I\'m so used to everything set in "<i>the future</i>" seeming to imagine decades of technological development telescoped into a\n  few years that it seems strange to see extrapolations from current experiments\n  being given something approximating a reasonable development arc. We\n  <i>could </i>have self-driving cars, digital brain scans and sentient AI by\n  the 2050s or 2060s. All of that is being worked on right now. I mean, we\n  <i>won\'t</i> but it\'s not like saying we\'ll have terraformed Mars or perfected\n  matter transmission by then.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, that\'s Upload for you. A very enjoyable show, often funny, sometimes\n  exciting, always heart-warming, never made a lot of sense. I did tear up a\n  little, right at the end, even though the final scene had been telegraphed for\n  most of the last episode.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I\'m sorry to see it end but I\'m very happy to see it end so well.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/sticking-ending.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/sticking-ending.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXluv_-OvHZfrcVsR0E2I-UnJD_3-6QQ-8smCZ7JC3PdBKcSLVmCnXeFnpcCrrPcgDWoPC-svX2L0F-qP4byvAoKOdBVptTQnyBZF-aeKqhDxUXWulSqeX9x9jL3aWVMAeUvZ2uSi14S_FDzmC96UBTRd1xHzbgYw6uCAAxHOIG_77kIe6oV36jQAmGt0/s72-w640-h322-c/upload1.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '2'}

Both of those are sorta-kinda third-person 3D games, which is not really what I\'m looking for.

Maybe combining a bunch of scorched skeleton bones in a burlap\nsack by pressing a big button marked COMBINE feels perfectly normal to people\nunder 20 now.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'d bet the rate of progress doesn\'t though. Boy, is it ever slow!&nbsp;</p><p>Or\n  <i>is </i>it? These assumptions need to be challenged!</p>\n<p>\n  It took a while but it did finally occur to me last night that maybe I might\n  be leveling up faster if I spent more of my time actually killing things and\n  less of it running around the city. In EverQuest in 2002 we didn\'t generally\n  expect to get our XP from quests. We just ran out the city gates ten seconds\n  after we were created and got straight down to killing rats, like any normal person would.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;I find these days - and indeed these last couple of decades - that just\n  the existence of a linear questline is enough to make me forget everything I\n  once knew. In game after game I step on that escalator the moment I see it and\n  do my best to ride it to the top, all the while complaining about how on rails\n  the whole experience has become.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  When I find myself in a game that doesn\'t bully, bribe or cajole me into\n  questing for a living, which neither Monsters&amp;Memories nor Stars Reach\n  does, rather than congratulating the developers on their thoughtfulness and\n  consideration in treating me with respect, as someone capable of setting my\n  own goals and finding my own fun, what do I do? Complain the game is aimless\n  or purposeless or not even a game at all and start bleating on about how\n  there\'s no narrative structure, like some caricature of an actor asking\n  "<i>...but what\'s my motivation?</i>"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just fricking get out there, kill stuff and watch your numbers go up! What\n  more motivation do you need? I tried a bit of that yesterday and it got me to Level Two. Well, that and the quest hand-in...</p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t know. It\'s been a long time, hasn\'t it? <i>Is </i>this what we want\n  any more? Is it what <i>I </i>want?\n</p>\n<p>I guess when Monsters&amp;Memories goes live I\'m going to\n  find out. <i>Pantheon </i>didn\'t do it for me so this is probably the last hurrah of the Golden Age horde.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s\n  looking promising so far.\n</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHmRtst6AJBNWp6rwY5z1HBOqfu_Uw6Aef8T40qJJO9vZwyXbkA72U2hZg62-cUrglsfx6uXD3Vm8LKMyp_-WnXeDjvVEtjxqdWSWzTD0PZ5JV0_zvr_j4Aybm8i16-tgDMkzjU6EFX7K96OujHXAejL0d6bDvo4lHnXbX-iYpfxRWxI0zKUMEr6gyGDo/s1920/m&amp;msun1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHmRtst6AJBNWp6rwY5z1HBOqfu_Uw6Aef8T40qJJO9vZwyXbkA72U2hZg62-cUrglsfx6uXD3Vm8LKMyp_-WnXeDjvVEtjxqdWSWzTD0PZ5JV0_zvr_j4Aybm8i16-tgDMkzjU6EFX7K96OujHXAejL0d6bDvo4lHnXbX-iYpfxRWxI0zKUMEr6gyGDo/w640-h360/m&amp;msun1.png" width="640" /></a><i>Stars Reach </i>isn\'t the only game in alpha (Sorry...\n  <i>pre</i>-alpha...) running lengthy testing sessions just now.\n  <i>Monsters &amp; Memories</i> is also ramping up towards reaching some kind\n  of always-on state later in the year - or perhaps early next year - by keeping the\n  servers up for longer and longer periods.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a "<i>Community Alpha Test</i>" on right now.

Maybe combining a bunch of scorched skeleton bones in a burlap\nsack by pressing a big button marked COMBINE feels perfectly normal to people\nunder 20 now.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'d bet the rate of progress doesn\'t though. Boy, is it ever slow!&nbsp;</p><p>Or\n  <i>is </i>it? These assumptions need to be challenged!</p>\n<p>\n  It took a while but it did finally occur to me last night that maybe I might\n  be leveling up faster if I spent more of my time actually killing things and\n  less of it running around the city. In EverQuest in 2002 we didn\'t generally\n  expect to get our XP from quests. We just ran out the city gates ten seconds\n  after we were created and got straight down to killing rats, like any normal person would.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;I find these days - and indeed these last couple of decades - that just\n  the existence of a linear questline is enough to make me forget everything I\n  once knew. In game after game I step on that escalator the moment I see it and\n  do my best to ride it to the top, all the while complaining about how on rails\n  the whole experience has become.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  When I find myself in a game that doesn\'t bully, bribe or cajole me into\n  questing for a living, which neither Monsters&amp;Memories nor Stars Reach\n  does, rather than congratulating the developers on their thoughtfulness and\n  consideration in treating me with respect, as someone capable of setting my\n  own goals and finding my own fun, what do I do? Complain the game is aimless\n  or purposeless or not even a game at all and start bleating on about how\n  there\'s no narrative structure, like some caricature of an actor asking\n  "<i>...but what\'s my motivation?</i>"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just fricking get out there, kill stuff and watch your numbers go up! What\n  more motivation do you need? I tried a bit of that yesterday and it got me to Level Two. Well, that and the quest hand-in...</p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t know.

Well, let\'s see. There are the potions. I have literally hundreds,maybe thousands of those stashed away and I hardly ever remember to use any of them. I am terrible about using consumables. I pretty much only remember they exist when I hit some kind of difficulty wall and have to start scratching around for any possible toe-hold to scramble over it.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, there hasn\'t been much of that sort of thing in the solo timelines these last few years, long may it continue. It does make all those potions somewhat redundant, though, and even if I did need some, I\'m sure the ones from a tier or two back would suffice. I\'m not going to need the very best ones, not in the content I\'m going to be doing.&nbsp;</p><p>I also don\'t need more unlocks for mount barding slots. I already have plenty of those stored in the bank. They\'re all identical, season to season, and they\'ve been popping out of the reward chests for years.</p><p>Ditto the very useful time-reducing potions that speed up mount, merc and familiar leveling. Again, I need them but I already have plenty. More is always good but I\'m most likely never going to get through the ones I have banked. It\'s certainly not worth the trouble of keeping Overseer going every day just for those.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSWzQKewmbaKb8wW895ZqJoMGVf6MDqk49Gkz_am5JEfuyGsEXhOOXwH2hu8CUgfr-vX3qqjbiyZRBDBEkpmMRQzkvy5P_WFOxl4XC-ln0MHfkCHqvOphwttrfMcodBzKmy-4mK3wxhMWHte_6qfs-uS7JtB7i8sxc0_SH_7SrrlHxb2P5K0GYcNro14g/s331/eq2s7tm.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSWzQKewmbaKb8wW895ZqJoMGVf6MDqk49Gkz_am5JEfuyGsEXhOOXwH2hu8CUgfr-vX3qqjbiyZRBDBEkpmMRQzkvy5P_WFOxl4XC-ln0MHfkCHqvOphwttrfMcodBzKmy-4mK3wxhMWHte_6qfs-uS7JtB7i8sxc0_SH_7SrrlHxb2P5K0GYcNro14g/s320/eq2s7tm.jpg" width="292" /></a></div><p>One thing that <i>is </i>worth it are the rare crafting mats. I would probably keep at it for those alone. I like gathering but it takes two rares to make each Expert scroll these days and just upgrading one new tier of spells for one character gets through sixty to a hundred rares. That\'s days and days of gathering even with all the boosts and bonuses and some good luck on rng and while I find it quite the meditative activity, there are limits even to my boredom threshold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Overseer pumps out a steady stream of rares, all the kinds too, so it\'s easy to sell the ones you don\'t want on the Broker and buy the ones you do. Takes a lot of the randomness out of the process.</p><p></p><p>The other thing I\'d <i>like </i>to get from Overseer is Mercenary Tokens. You need one of those before most of the available mercs in each expansion will entertain the idea of working for you and there are lots of mercs I don\'t have yet. You need as many as possible to boost the stats of your Mercenary Battalion, about which do not ask because I don\'t understand it well enough to explain, but trust me, it\'s a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, for whatever reason, I no longer seem to get any Merc tokens from Overseer. I used to get far more than I had any use for but over the last two or three tiers, although they\'re clearly there in the list of possible drops, I haven\'t seen single one from many hundred of crates. I\'m guessing that\'s some kind of bug but who knows? Also, they used to be tradable and they sold on the broker for coppers, so I probably should look into just buying them next time I log in...</p><p>So, why am I bothering? Just for the rare mats and the hope, one day, merc tokens might start dropping again?</p><p>Well, yes, kind of... but mostly because, having seen just how fricking hard it is to get caught up, I really don\'t want to fall behind again. And also because I thought I was almost there.&nbsp;After today, I\'m not so sure.</p><p>This morning I dinged 60 Overseer, something I\'ve been very much looking forward to because I thought it would put me in the current season, Season 7.

There\'s also an achievement for Level 65 Overseer, though, which reminds me that, even if there\'s no Season 8 yet, I do still have to grind another ten levels just to get to the end of Season 7.</p><p>It never ends. Or rather it does but never soon enough. And now, of course, I have all the "<i>fun</i>" of&nbsp; logging in and out all day to refresh and collect my two (Count \'em! Two!) low-quality, one hour missions.

Of which, more later.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEir6JeXyKh_tlexmU_t7OxQpelQLiON5zqhB6b8N127EK3aYulsVxPXq_B04QgY30K2DAC6KFw5Cr5lALwFg3_4C7fKmzw5zy2wxz_j0rDmQklA8SnuOdqt42_xX_7-sKHqMUuUPBP4dlRecMO-XL9fM_UOl4h6BQoU4_N1AXwcUVAqk_mcjaCVc3Lk2OQ/s607/eq2s72m1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="208" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEir6JeXyKh_tlexmU_t7OxQpelQLiON5zqhB6b8N127EK3aYulsVxPXq_B04QgY30K2DAC6KFw5Cr5lALwFg3_4C7fKmzw5zy2wxz_j0rDmQklA8SnuOdqt42_xX_7-sKHqMUuUPBP4dlRecMO-XL9fM_UOl4h6BQoU4_N1AXwcUVAqk_mcjaCVc3Lk2OQ/w640-h208/eq2s72m1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>Okay, then, the Overseer gear\'s a bust but what about all the other goodies? Well, let\'s see. There are the potions. I have literally hundreds,maybe thousands of those stashed away and I hardly ever remember to use any of them. I am terrible about using consumables. I pretty much only remember they exist when I hit some kind of difficulty wall and have to start scratching around for any possible toe-hold to scramble over it.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, there hasn\'t been much of that sort of thing in the solo timelines these last few years, long may it continue. It does make all those potions somewhat redundant, though, and even if I did need some, I\'m sure the ones from a tier or two back would suffice. I\'m not going to need the very best ones, not in the content I\'m going to be doing.&nbsp;</p><p>I also don\'t need more unlocks for mount barding slots. I already have plenty of those stored in the bank. They\'re all identical, season to season, and they\'ve been popping out of the reward chests for years.</p><p>Ditto the very useful time-reducing potions that speed up mount, merc and familiar leveling. Again, I need them but I already have plenty. More is always good but I\'m most likely never going to get through the ones I have banked. It\'s certainly not worth the trouble of keeping Overseer going every day just for those.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSWzQKewmbaKb8wW895ZqJoMGVf6MDqk49Gkz_am5JEfuyGsEXhOOXwH2hu8CUgfr-vX3qqjbiyZRBDBEkpmMRQzkvy5P_WFOxl4XC-ln0MHfkCHqvOphwttrfMcodBzKmy-4mK3wxhMWHte_6qfs-uS7JtB7i8sxc0_SH_7SrrlHxb2P5K0GYcNro14g/s331/eq2s7tm.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSWzQKewmbaKb8wW895ZqJoMGVf6MDqk49Gkz_am5JEfuyGsEXhOOXwH2hu8CUgfr-vX3qqjbiyZRBDBEkpmMRQzkvy5P_WFOxl4XC-ln0MHfkCHqvOphwttrfMcodBzKmy-4mK3wxhMWHte_6qfs-uS7JtB7i8sxc0_SH_7SrrlHxb2P5K0GYcNro14g/s320/eq2s7tm.jpg" width="292" /></a></div><p>One thing that <i>is </i>worth it are the rare crafting mats. I would probably keep at it for those alone. I like gathering but it takes two rares to make each Expert scroll these days and just upgrading one new tier of spells for one character gets through sixty to a hundred rares. That\'s days and days of gathering even with all the boosts and bonuses and some good luck on rng and while I find it quite the meditative activity, there are limits even to my boredom threshold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Overseer pumps out a steady stream of rares, all the kinds too, so it\'s easy to sell the ones you don\'t want on the Broker and buy the ones you do. Takes a lot of the randomness out of the process.</p><p></p><p>The other thing I\'d <i>like </i>to get from Overseer is Mercenary Tokens. You need one of those before most of the available mercs in each expansion will entertain the idea of working for you and there are lots of mercs I don\'t have yet. You need as many as possible to boost the stats of your Mercenary Battalion, about which do not ask because I don\'t understand it well enough to explain, but trust me, it\'s a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, for whatever reason, I no longer seem to get any Merc tokens from Overseer. I used to get far more than I had any use for but over the last two or three tiers, although they\'re clearly there in the list of possible drops, I haven\'t seen single one from many hundred of crates. I\'m guessing that\'s some kind of bug but who knows? Also, they used to be tradable and they sold on the broker for coppers, so I probably should look into just buying them next time I log in...</p><p>So, why am I bothering? Just for the rare mats and the hope, one day, merc tokens might start dropping again?</p><p>Well, yes, kind of... but mostly because, having seen just how fricking hard it is to get caught up, I really don\'t want to fall behind again. And also because I thought I was almost there.&nbsp;After today, I\'m not so sure.</p><p>This morning I dinged 60 Overseer, something I\'ve been very much looking forward to because I thought it would put me in the current season, Season 7.

There\'s also an achievement for Level 65 Overseer, though, which reminds me that, even if there\'s no Season 8 yet, I do still have to grind another ten levels just to get to the end of Season 7.</p><p>It never ends.

I think. Something like that, anyway.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Which is actually a lot less than I thought. I completely forgot I logged in\n  at the end of May. I thought I hadn\'t set foot in the game since before the\n  <i>Kickstarter</i>.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what I told whoever it is that has the fun job of reading all the\n  surveys and collating the data, anyway. I do like a survey but when I got the\n  email a few days ago - well, the three emails, since I\'m still signed up for\n  the testing program on multiple accounts - I wasn\'t going to respond because\n  what could I have said? I have no clue what Stars Reach is like now, it\'s been\n  so long since I\'ve played.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But then curiosity got the better of me and I opened one of the forms, just to\n  see what they were asking, and it turned out they only wanted to know what\n  people thought of the first hour of the game.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style="text-align: center;">\n        <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjayxABAkeZuxIFPwq1VflrmGMjWy-uLPekB2if8ZzuH-f4w4YYSFnN9RA95CIZDkJmBpAuIstXi-UWL4uzcHd_upsRJPivdyyeVixSwH9lu9fuBMrUapoLTpWdbUEeCA2n_eg3i2j4dVFDroMabyi4TDCmK8KxYnVQIq04rzX0qNDXujRleTVb0L0RkOw/s1120/srdod1.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="349" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjayxABAkeZuxIFPwq1VflrmGMjWy-uLPekB2if8ZzuH-f4w4YYSFnN9RA95CIZDkJmBpAuIstXi-UWL4uzcHd_upsRJPivdyyeVixSwH9lu9fuBMrUapoLTpWdbUEeCA2n_eg3i2j4dVFDroMabyi4TDCmK8KxYnVQIq04rzX0qNDXujRleTVb0L0RkOw/w400-h349/srdod1.jpg" width="400" /></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">\n        <span style="font-size: medium;">Don\'t bother trying to dodge.<br />They use death as a teaching aid here.</span>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nI have been keeping Stars Reach patched up, even though I haven\'t been logging\nin and <i>Playable Worlds</i> is now running a series of lengthy tests as they\ngear up for 24/7 testing. This was on Saturday and I had the feeling a test had\njust started, which indeed it had. In fact, it started last Thursday and it\'s\nstill going as I write.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Why not, then? I could give them an hour of my time and report back on what I\n  thought about it. I mean, I <i>did </i>kind of sign up to test the thing, not\n  to mention be in the creator program (Ironic laughter...) although any\n  responsibility for any of that I ever felt dissipated the moment my credit\n  card got charged for the Kickstarter pledge. I\'m a paying customer now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  First, obviously, I had to make a new character. Well, in a manner of\n  speaking. There is now some slight semblance of a character creation process\n  but it\'s two choices and move on.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a bit of flavor text, which I personally find obnoxious and have\n  already complained about in feedback more than once. Oddly perhaps, I do not\n  find being repeatedly addressed, sneeringly, as "<i>meatbag</i>" endears me to\n  the game or makes me want to come back for more.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All you really get to choose at this stage, though, is your name and race.\n  Everything else is "<i>To be added</i>" or some such excuse. I guess that does\n  at least tell us we <i>will </i>be able to customize our character, one day.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most irritatingly of all, the whole "<i>what you look like changes every time you zone</i>" thing is still going. It\'s disorienting enough to have your character\n  randomized at the start but to have it re-randomized just when you were\n  starting to get used to it is infuriating. If that\'s actually testing\n  something - still - then fair enough but it seems unlikely. In fact, now I\n  think about it, maybe it\'s not even intentional.

It\'s new since I was last there, takes place in\nspace, and goes through the basic controls quite effectively, although it took\nme several goes to get the crawling under the fallen beam part right and the bit\nwhere it gives you a fire extinguisher feels redundant when there turns out to\nbe no fire to extinguish.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  It does a job, though, and the space station looks quite impressive. It\'s a\n  much better way to begin than the previous version.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of the tutorial you have to pick a class. They don\'t call it that,\n  of course, (They call it a "<i>profession</i>".) because this is a classless\n  game where anyone can be anything but it damn well <i>is </i>a class all the\n  same, or at best an archetype. From memory you can be a crafter, an explorer,\n  a warrior or something I\'ve forgotten. Farmer, maybe?\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game tells you not to worry too much about it because later you can do all\n  the things but that\'s like your school-teacher telling you not to complain\n  about having to learn the boring stuff now because it\'ll get interesting when\n  you go to college. Who bloody cares? I want to do something that\'s interesting\n  <i>now</i>!\n</p>\n<p>Or fun. I\'d take fun.</p>\n<p>\n  If I hadn\'t already played about fifteen hours of various stages of pre-alpha,\n  back when you really could do what you liked right from the start, even if\n  there wasn\'t that much of it to do, I think this time <i>would</i> have been\n  fun. New stuff generally is. Without the novelty factor and by comparison to\n  how it used to be , though, it seemed a bit limited. Dull, even.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style="text-align: center;">\n        <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhS0-Jn-E-vFVepI3orQQVVHWe9_RrKOJQD0aI5bmYEIKk8Ec5LMtDHQkbwDrEv8q1i-XWYqU_vp4W8XAaVRxwQR9idXEPuakOq8H6LZ5HWoDdVogAhSpAumuXP8cXdpnNoDc0z-euGCpDXntkf-drc_E2rEgjS08wLopR2FEHLKX22f7ow7RUDernFBxU/s858/srmb1.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="229" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhS0-Jn-E-vFVepI3orQQVVHWe9_RrKOJQD0aI5bmYEIKk8Ec5LMtDHQkbwDrEv8q1i-XWYqU_vp4W8XAaVRxwQR9idXEPuakOq8H6LZ5HWoDdVogAhSpAumuXP8cXdpnNoDc0z-euGCpDXntkf-drc_E2rEgjS08wLopR2FEHLKX22f7ow7RUDernFBxU/w400-h229/srmb1.jpg" width="400" /></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">\n        <span style="font-size: medium;">Ha bloody ha.</span>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nI picked Explorer, which I was well aware would mean running around, listening\nto an echo-locator pinging as I tried to find sixty-four flashing pyramids.\nUnder the new regime, you only get the tools you need for your designated job,\nso it was do that or don\'t do anything at all.

By the time I gave up, after my second (Or\n  was it third?)&nbsp;death,&nbsp;I\'d earned more points in combat-related\n  skills than all the others put together.

I always thought it was an\nattractive-looking game but now it\'s positively gorgeous. The graphics are\nhighly stylized but they really do look beautiful. I took some screenshots and I\nwould have taken more if the camera controls weren\'t so goddam awful. Seriously,\nyou should surely at least be able to 360 around your motionless character\nwithout having to go into the settings to work out how to do it. If it\'s even\npossible. I never did work out how but it may be in there, somewhere.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  The whole time I was playing (Okay, it was only three-quarters of an hour...)\n  the only other players I saw were afk at the revive spot, presumably where\n  they\'d died and wandered off to do something more interesting instead, leaving\n  their characters idling. I\'m sure there\'s something going on somewhere that\'s\n  more engaging than what was happening where I was and that\'s presumably where\n  the players are but I know from experience just how much work there is before\n  you get anywhere near anything like that and I have no intention of going\n  through all those steps again, or not until I\'m confident whatever progress I\n  make won\'t be wiped before the next time I log in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  My brief session did gain me enough experience to fill out the survey, so\n  after I logged out that\'s what I did. I doubt my answers were very helpful,\n  consisting as they did of&nbsp; a lot of "<i>None of the Above</i>s" as a long\n  list of options seeemed to have no relevance to anything I\'d done or\n  seen.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did, however, take the opportunity to write a short essay in the "<i>Is there anything else you\'d like to tell us</i>?" section. I had the good sense to copy and past it into a local file, so\n  here\'s what I said, word for word:&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <span style="font-size: medium;">Before today I hadn\'t played since before the Kickstarter. I\'d pretty much\n    decided by then, after the earlier tests I was in, that it\'s not really my\n    sort of game. No narrative makes it feel directionless and so far there\'s no\n    real way to build a character in meaningful ways, by which I mean working on\n    appearance and personality. Having what your character looks like keep\n    changing outside of your control is a game-breaker, even in a testing phase.\n    Even in a test I need to feel some attachment to my character or else it\'s\n    just like a job I\'m not being paid to do. As for gameplay, it\'s too heavily\n    oriented around skill acquisition all of which takes far, FAR too long.\n    Movement is enervating. I feel physically tired after a few minutes because\n    of the way I have to drag the camera to see anything. Not being able to\n    swing the camera 360 degrees with the character remaining still is very\n    frustrating. Also the combat is deeply irritating. Should be able to play a\n    non-combat character and not have to fight at all. Aggressive mobs have\n    absolutely no place in starter areas, let alone in these numbers. Basically,\n    I find most aspects of the game annoying. It has great potential but the\n    mechanics appear to be almost intentionally getting in the way of any of it\n    being fun. Having played for 45 minutes today, I do think it has improved\n    but I still don\'t feel like playing again. I would recommend it to others\n    because I can see how it would appeal to some people but it doesn\'t do much\n    for me.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I did kind of bang that out in a bit of a temper because, as often tends to be\n  the way, I ended my Stars Reach session feeling quite irritable and annoyed.\n  It\'s a weird experience. The game seems like it ought to be fun but somehow it\n  mostly isn\'t. It\'s a lot of fuss and bother for not very much&nbsp; reward let\n  alone entertainment but it feels like it shouldn\'t be.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the past I\'ve tended to put that down to it just not being my sort of game\n  but really it\'s not all that different, mechanically, to any other\n  survival-crafting game and I\'ve had great times in several of those. So what\n  exactly is it about Stars Reach that increasingly seems to rub me up the wrong\n  way?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Partly, I think, it\'s that this really is still very early in the development\n  process. Most of the time, most of what\'s there works fairly well, which is\n  great, but also means the game has an unfortunate tendency to feel a lot more\n  finished than it really is. It does say right there on the loading screen that\n  it\'s "<i>pre-alpha</i>". You don\'t get much earlier than that.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Much of what feels like it\'s missing feels that way because it really\n  <i>is </i>missing and for very good reason: it hasn\'t been done yet. It will\n  be, one day, and complaining that it\'s not there now seems silly.\n  Unfortunately, if you\'re <i>asking </i>me what the game feels like now, as\n  surveys tend to do, then without all the stuff that isn\'t in yet, well, yes,\n  it probably <i>is </i>going to feel bad. Unavoidable, perhaps, but there it\n  is.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The other thing that puts me off is much more nebulous. Stars Reach just feels\n  like it doesn\'t really <i>want</i> me to be there. It\'s a hostile environment\n  with very few amenities and everything is hard work. And there doesn\'t really\n  seem to be much of a reason why I&nbsp;<i>should&nbsp;</i>be there, anyway. What am I\n  actually supposed to be doing?&nbsp;</p><p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfQI7gEy72vN0JynNrhjv5hw0G58VwgojyJZyfFIAa_lVmtInQSRpyRQ71vyDLd1N5EsKX961P-anTtK2jQz_erxRPOvYcyx_J6M2ZUGAmwmL1fCwhFVCgxYUlcFAmxgMdfBoA14dlVl6DuoC26RSHywVFcaGAZ2u-Tbsz1Q8Pts6N4A9cbapFG0ibfAs/s1462/srfield1.jpg" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfQI7gEy72vN0JynNrhjv5hw0G58VwgojyJZyfFIAa_lVmtInQSRpyRQ71vyDLd1N5EsKX961P-anTtK2jQz_erxRPOvYcyx_J6M2ZUGAmwmL1fCwhFVCgxYUlcFAmxgMdfBoA14dlVl6DuoC26RSHywVFcaGAZ2u-Tbsz1Q8Pts6N4A9cbapFG0ibfAs/w640-h396/srfield1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">One of those games that looks better when you\'re there than in screenshots, I think.</span></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  The snarky narrative wrapper that currently offers just about all there is for\n  context really doesn\'t help. Apparently I\'m an idiot from a race of idiots who\n  messed everything up, only to survive on charity that\'s given grudgingly at\n  best. The game wastes no time in making the player feel positively unwelcome\n  which is a big risk that for me very much does not pay off.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Having the game insult the player, let alone having that be the only way the\n  game communicates, seems like asking for pushback, which in the case of a\n  video game would usually consist of logging out, uninstalling and then\n  bad-mouthing it to anyone who\'ll listen. I imagine there are people who find\n  the "<i>meatbag</i>" routine hilarious. I am not one of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But more than that, there\'s a fug of earnestness surrounding Stars Reach, as\n  if somehow playing it might be good for you. It reeks of being in the Scouts\n  or some kind of social program, where everything builds character or community\n  or is for your own good. Hard to put my finger on why it feels that way&nbsp;\n  but for me it\'s there and it\'s been there from the start.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Again, almost certainly a big positive for some people but not me.&nbsp;I\n  don\'t respond to it well at all and the combination of that sensation with\n  open insults is just weird. And not in a good way.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And yet, as I said in the survey, I <i>would </i>recommend Stars Reach to\n  others. It has the potential to be a solid experience when it\'s finished and\n  it\'s not too shabby even now. It runs well and it looks good and there\'s\n  enough to do to keep you busy for a while, which I\'m sure is more than enough\n  for a lot of people, not to mention more than what a lot of games a lot\n  further along in development can offer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So please don\'t let me put you off if, unlike me, you don\'t mind being called\n  a meatbag every five minutes.&nbsp;\n</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKNZduoNNn69pqouMnOtCCk4inijTbhfYsW039FVK72XtdB1iAwI3VcKkNa3k0Tqg-fvTaoxH9cSkDeT_E_PdoBYtdLiAAPm7EOHzoqsCjz7ApGRL4bO4Npryl_JklZK0nNYCagSF7YV1m2tscQmuivRiuDqLwEtQmGtU5SzrFcQ5vh3w0x0uoxZEK_aw/s1920/srsplash1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKNZduoNNn69pqouMnOtCCk4inijTbhfYsW039FVK72XtdB1iAwI3VcKkNa3k0Tqg-fvTaoxH9cSkDeT_E_PdoBYtdLiAAPm7EOHzoqsCjz7ApGRL4bO4Npryl_JklZK0nNYCagSF7YV1m2tscQmuivRiuDqLwEtQmGtU5SzrFcQ5vh3w0x0uoxZEK_aw/w640-h360/srsplash1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Bless me Ralph, for I have sinned.

I think. Something like that, anyway.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Which is actually a lot less than I thought. I completely forgot I logged in\n  at the end of May. I thought I hadn\'t set foot in the game since before the\n  <i>Kickstarter</i>.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what I told whoever it is that has the fun job of reading all the\n  surveys and collating the data, anyway.

I have no clue what Stars Reach is like now, it\'s been\n  so long since I\'ve played.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But then curiosity got the better of me and I opened one of the forms, just to\n  see what they were asking, and it turned out they only wanted to know what\n  people thought of the first hour of the game.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style="text-align: center;">\n        <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjayxABAkeZuxIFPwq1VflrmGMjWy-uLPekB2if8ZzuH-f4w4YYSFnN9RA95CIZDkJmBpAuIstXi-UWL4uzcHd_upsRJPivdyyeVixSwH9lu9fuBMrUapoLTpWdbUEeCA2n_eg3i2j4dVFDroMabyi4TDCmK8KxYnVQIq04rzX0qNDXujRleTVb0L0RkOw/s1120/srdod1.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="349" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjayxABAkeZuxIFPwq1VflrmGMjWy-uLPekB2if8ZzuH-f4w4YYSFnN9RA95CIZDkJmBpAuIstXi-UWL4uzcHd_upsRJPivdyyeVixSwH9lu9fuBMrUapoLTpWdbUEeCA2n_eg3i2j4dVFDroMabyi4TDCmK8KxYnVQIq04rzX0qNDXujRleTVb0L0RkOw/w400-h349/srdod1.jpg" width="400" /></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">\n        <span style="font-size: medium;">Don\'t bother trying to dodge.<br />They use death as a teaching aid here.</span>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nI have been keeping Stars Reach patched up, even though I haven\'t been logging\nin and <i>Playable Worlds</i> is now running a series of lengthy tests as they\ngear up for 24/7 testing. This was on Saturday and I had the feeling a test had\njust started, which indeed it had. In fact, it started last Thursday and it\'s\nstill going as I write.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Why not, then? I could give them an hour of my time and report back on what I\n  thought about it. I mean, I <i>did </i>kind of sign up to test the thing, not\n  to mention be in the creator program (Ironic laughter...) although any\n  responsibility for any of that I ever felt dissipated the moment my credit\n  card got charged for the Kickstarter pledge. I\'m a paying customer now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  First, obviously, I had to make a new character. Well, in a manner of\n  speaking. There is now some slight semblance of a character creation process\n  but it\'s two choices and move on.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a bit of flavor text, which I personally find obnoxious and have\n  already complained about in feedback more than once. Oddly perhaps, I do not\n  find being repeatedly addressed, sneeringly, as "<i>meatbag</i>" endears me to\n  the game or makes me want to come back for more.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All you really get to choose at this stage, though, is your name and race.\n  Everything else is "<i>To be added</i>" or some such excuse. I guess that does\n  at least tell us we <i>will </i>be able to customize our character, one day.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most irritatingly of all, the whole "<i>what you look like changes every time you zone</i>" thing is still going. It\'s disorienting enough to have your character\n  randomized at the start but to have it re-randomized just when you were\n  starting to get used to it is infuriating. If that\'s actually testing\n  something - still - then fair enough but it seems unlikely. In fact, now I\n  think about it, maybe it\'s not even intentional.

It\'s new since I was last there, takes place in\nspace, and goes through the basic controls quite effectively, although it took\nme several goes to get the crawling under the fallen beam part right and the bit\nwhere it gives you a fire extinguisher feels redundant when there turns out to\nbe no fire to extinguish.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  It does a job, though, and the space station looks quite impressive. It\'s a\n  much better way to begin than the previous version.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of the tutorial you have to pick a class. They don\'t call it that,\n  of course, (They call it a "<i>profession</i>".) because this is a classless\n  game where anyone can be anything but it damn well <i>is </i>a class all the\n  same, or at best an archetype. From memory you can be a crafter, an explorer,\n  a warrior or something I\'ve forgotten. Farmer, maybe?\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game tells you not to worry too much about it because later you can do all\n  the things but that\'s like your school-teacher telling you not to complain\n  about having to learn the boring stuff now because it\'ll get interesting when\n  you go to college. Who bloody cares? I want to do something that\'s interesting\n  <i>now</i>!\n</p>\n<p>Or fun. I\'d take fun.</p>\n<p>\n  If I hadn\'t already played about fifteen hours of various stages of pre-alpha,\n  back when you really could do what you liked right from the start, even if\n  there wasn\'t that much of it to do, I think this time <i>would</i> have been\n  fun. New stuff generally is. Without the novelty factor and by comparison to\n  how it used to be , though, it seemed a bit limited.

I did that for\n  about half an hour and found over a dozen, which is more than I expected but\n  fewer that it would have been if I hadn\'t had to keep stopping to fight and/or\n  run from the extremely aggressive wildlife.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style="text-align: center;">\n        <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ6xvtlo_jn0QGGCh4b5ZeZsxjE0bjUP2X0TkVg1mOYe_xh9pZudzETYqPFP8Mxz4X7Ko_pUskXuSibtEbaw2SfIH9POmggFTTLexwYmL47I2chyin_C6vivyL1cKviEtj-PK5_ChvZuefmS-nBhnf0C6qbNc-FSDrr7oZJ7IApn3oHeilD5nRnDB2yFY/s1332/srneb1.jpg" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="221" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ6xvtlo_jn0QGGCh4b5ZeZsxjE0bjUP2X0TkVg1mOYe_xh9pZudzETYqPFP8Mxz4X7Ko_pUskXuSibtEbaw2SfIH9POmggFTTLexwYmL47I2chyin_C6vivyL1cKviEtj-PK5_ChvZuefmS-nBhnf0C6qbNc-FSDrr7oZJ7IApn3oHeilD5nRnDB2yFY/w400-h221/srneb1.jpg" width="400" /></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">\n        <span style="font-size: medium;">Is this the Down escalator?</span>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nI have been complaining about this design choice since pretty much the first\ntime I ever played the game and while it has improved it\'s still very far from\nacceptable. <i>EverQuest</i>\'s infamous <i>Gates of Discord</i> expansion should\nnot be the template for newbie zones in any game.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  They do at least give you a gun - an Omniblaster - no matter what class you\n  pick, so you can try to defend yourself but good luck with that when you get\n  swarmed, as you inevitably will. By the time I gave up, after my second (Or\n  was it third?)&nbsp;death,&nbsp;I\'d earned more points in combat-related\n  skills than all the others put together. That seems ridiculous, especially\n  when I thought I\'d picked a non-combat class so I wouldn\'t need to fight\n  anything. Can\'t say I was surprised about it though. It happens every\n  time.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of this was very familiar, as was the terrain, hacked up by players and\n  left full of holes to fall down as it was. The grass does seem to grow over\n  the piles of debris now. It looked more like a huge field full of mature ants\'\n  nests than the usual abandoned quarry, so that was an improvement, visually\n  anyway.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style="text-align: center;">\n        <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2PgF06wv-KAOwQ3rEFBVIbgMOh3N_P1TnQf_7KVsDKVumnbP2OepS4XAlMXYoYB-ZlzLldDjWpL-zXEEZuRLHb4_D0bSRaZxie6z9e05WEOshFHG0PMOd3Xn08Wjjmp60vxwdcZvSe8uJl6g2WoLUSwTv0xZUTBCDy6aV1EXRv8r7MxT_eXYHXlzriKo/s954/srslim1.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2PgF06wv-KAOwQ3rEFBVIbgMOh3N_P1TnQf_7KVsDKVumnbP2OepS4XAlMXYoYB-ZlzLldDjWpL-zXEEZuRLHb4_D0bSRaZxie6z9e05WEOshFHG0PMOd3Xn08Wjjmp60vxwdcZvSe8uJl6g2WoLUSwTv0xZUTBCDy6aV1EXRv8r7MxT_eXYHXlzriKo/w286-h400/srslim1.jpg" width="286" /></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">\n        <span style="font-size: medium;">A close look at this picture will prove <br />I have no observational\n          skills whatsoever. <br />Also wow!

I always thought it was an\nattractive-looking game but now it\'s positively gorgeous. The graphics are\nhighly stylized but they really do look beautiful. I took some screenshots and I\nwould have taken more if the camera controls weren\'t so goddam awful. Seriously,\nyou should surely at least be able to 360 around your motionless character\nwithout having to go into the settings to work out how to do it. If it\'s even\npossible. I never did work out how but it may be in there, somewhere.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  The whole time I was playing (Okay, it was only three-quarters of an hour...)\n  the only other players I saw were afk at the revive spot, presumably where\n  they\'d died and wandered off to do something more interesting instead, leaving\n  their characters idling. I\'m sure there\'s something going on somewhere that\'s\n  more engaging than what was happening where I was and that\'s presumably where\n  the players are but I know from experience just how much work there is before\n  you get anywhere near anything like that and I have no intention of going\n  through all those steps again, or not until I\'m confident whatever progress I\n  make won\'t be wiped before the next time I log in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  My brief session did gain me enough experience to fill out the survey, so\n  after I logged out that\'s what I did. I doubt my answers were very helpful,\n  consisting as they did of&nbsp; a lot of "<i>None of the Above</i>s" as a long\n  list of options seeemed to have no relevance to anything I\'d done or\n  seen.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did, however, take the opportunity to write a short essay in the "<i>Is there anything else you\'d like to tell us</i>?" section. I had the good sense to copy and past it into a local file, so\n  here\'s what I said, word for word:&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <span style="font-size: medium;">Before today I hadn\'t played since before the Kickstarter. I\'d pretty much\n    decided by then, after the earlier tests I was in, that it\'s not really my\n    sort of game. No narrative makes it feel directionless and so far there\'s no\n    real way to build a character in meaningful ways, by which I mean working on\n    appearance and personality. Having what your character looks like keep\n    changing outside of your control is a game-breaker, even in a testing phase.\n    Even in a test I need to feel some attachment to my character or else it\'s\n    just like a job I\'m not being paid to do. As for gameplay, it\'s too heavily\n    oriented around skill acquisition all of which takes far, FAR too long.\n    Movement is enervating. I feel physically tired after a few minutes because\n    of the way I have to drag the camera to see anything. Not being able to\n    swing the camera 360 degrees with the character remaining still is very\n    frustrating. Also the combat is deeply irritating. Should be able to play a\n    non-combat character and not have to fight at all. Aggressive mobs have\n    absolutely no place in starter areas, let alone in these numbers. Basically,\n    I find most aspects of the game annoying. It has great potential but the\n    mechanics appear to be almost intentionally getting in the way of any of it\n    being fun. Having played for 45 minutes today, I do think it has improved\n    but I still don\'t feel like playing again. I would recommend it to others\n    because I can see how it would appeal to some people but it doesn\'t do much\n    for me.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I did kind of bang that out in a bit of a temper because, as often tends to be\n  the way, I ended my Stars Reach session feeling quite irritable and annoyed.\n  It\'s a weird experience. The game seems like it ought to be fun but somehow it\n  mostly isn\'t. It\'s a lot of fuss and bother for not very much&nbsp; reward let\n  alone entertainment but it feels like it shouldn\'t be.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the past I\'ve tended to put that down to it just not being my sort of game\n  but really it\'s not all that different, mechanically, to any other\n  survival-crafting game and I\'ve had great times in several of those. So what\n  exactly is it about Stars Reach that increasingly seems to rub me up the wrong\n  way?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Partly, I think, it\'s that this really is still very early in the development\n  process. Most of the time, most of what\'s there works fairly well, which is\n  great, but also means the game has an unfortunate tendency to feel a lot more\n  finished than it really is. It does say right there on the loading screen that\n  it\'s "<i>pre-alpha</i>". You don\'t get much earlier than that.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Much of what feels like it\'s missing feels that way because it really\n  <i>is </i>missing and for very good reason: it hasn\'t been done yet. It will\n  be, one day, and complaining that it\'s not there now seems silly.\n  Unfortunately, if you\'re <i>asking </i>me what the game feels like now, as\n  surveys tend to do, then without all the stuff that isn\'t in yet, well, yes,\n  it probably <i>is </i>going to feel bad. Unavoidable, perhaps, but there it\n  is.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The other thing that puts me off is much more nebulous. Stars Reach just feels\n  like it doesn\'t really <i>want</i> me to be there. It\'s a hostile environment\n  with very few amenities and everything is hard work. And there doesn\'t really\n  seem to be much of a reason why I&nbsp;<i>should&nbsp;</i>be there, anyway. What am I\n  actually supposed to be doing?&nbsp;</p><p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfQI7gEy72vN0JynNrhjv5hw0G58VwgojyJZyfFIAa_lVmtInQSRpyRQ71vyDLd1N5EsKX961P-anTtK2jQz_erxRPOvYcyx_J6M2ZUGAmwmL1fCwhFVCgxYUlcFAmxgMdfBoA14dlVl6DuoC26RSHywVFcaGAZ2u-Tbsz1Q8Pts6N4A9cbapFG0ibfAs/s1462/srfield1.jpg" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfQI7gEy72vN0JynNrhjv5hw0G58VwgojyJZyfFIAa_lVmtInQSRpyRQ71vyDLd1N5EsKX961P-anTtK2jQz_erxRPOvYcyx_J6M2ZUGAmwmL1fCwhFVCgxYUlcFAmxgMdfBoA14dlVl6DuoC26RSHywVFcaGAZ2u-Tbsz1Q8Pts6N4A9cbapFG0ibfAs/w640-h396/srfield1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">One of those games that looks better when you\'re there than in screenshots, I think.</span></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  The snarky narrative wrapper that currently offers just about all there is for\n  context really doesn\'t help. Apparently I\'m an idiot from a race of idiots who\n  messed everything up, only to survive on charity that\'s given grudgingly at\n  best. The game wastes no time in making the player feel positively unwelcome\n  which is a big risk that for me very much does not pay off.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Having the game insult the player, let alone having that be the only way the\n  game communicates, seems like asking for pushback, which in the case of a\n  video game would usually consist of logging out, uninstalling and then\n  bad-mouthing it to anyone who\'ll listen. I imagine there are people who find\n  the "<i>meatbag</i>" routine hilarious. I am not one of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But more than that, there\'s a fug of earnestness surrounding Stars Reach, as\n  if somehow playing it might be good for you. It reeks of being in the Scouts\n  or some kind of social program, where everything builds character or community\n  or is for your own good. Hard to put my finger on why it feels that way&nbsp;\n  but for me it\'s there and it\'s been there from the start.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Again, almost certainly a big positive for some people but not me.&nbsp;I\n  don\'t respond to it well at all and the combination of that sensation with\n  open insults is just weird. And not in a good way.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And yet, as I said in the survey, I <i>would </i>recommend Stars Reach to\n  others. It has the potential to be a solid experience when it\'s finished and\n  it\'s not too shabby even now. It runs well and it looks good and there\'s\n  enough to do to keep you busy for a while, which I\'m sure is more than enough\n  for a lot of people, not to mention more than what a lot of games a lot\n  further along in development can offer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So please don\'t let me put you off if, unlike me, you don\'t mind being called\n  a meatbag every five minutes.&nbsp;\n</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/hey-stars-reach-its-been-while-hows-it.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/hey-stars-reach-its-been-while-hows-it.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKNZduoNNn69pqouMnOtCCk4inijTbhfYsW039FVK72XtdB1iAwI3VcKkNa3k0Tqg-fvTaoxH9cSkDeT_E_PdoBYtdLiAAPm7EOHzoqsCjz7ApGRL4bO4Npryl_JklZK0nNYCagSF7YV1m2tscQmuivRiuDqLwEtQmGtU5SzrFcQ5vh3w0x0uoxZEK_aw/s72-w640-h360-c/srsplash1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

From meticulously planning road layouts in Cities: Skylines to managing survival in Frostpunk, I love the challenge of building something from the ground up.&nbsp;<p></p><p>But <a href="https://www.polymorph.games/en/" target="_blank">Polymorph Game</a>\'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/690830/Foundation/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> feels different.</p><p>After finally diving in over the weekend—despite having picked it up in Early Access in 2023—I found myself completely losing track of time. Somehow, four hours vanished out of thin air. The way villages grow organically, without a rigid grid, gives the game a unique feel, and balancing resources and villager needs is incredibly rewarding. Add in its gorgeous visuals, and I can already tell this is a city-builder I’ll be spending a lot more time with.</p><p>Of course, learning a new game like Foundation can be a challenge, and that’s where great content creators make all the difference. I’ve followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CityPlannerPlays" target="_blank">City Planner Plays</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://@cityplannerplays.bsky.social">@cityplannerplays.bsky.social</a>) for years—first for his Cities: Skylines content and later for his deep-dive How-To guides in other games. His approach is what makes him stand out: clear, structured instructions, useful background context, and a willingness to show his own mistakes when they serve as valuable lessons.</p><p>This post is as much a learning tool for myself as it is a guide for anyone new to the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, I’ve broken down City Planner Plays’ step-by-step instructions for starting a village, prioritizing buildings, and setting up a successful economy.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re diving into the game for the first time (or coming back like me), this should help you get started—and I highly recommend checking out his full video (below) for even more insights.</p><h2>How to Start Your Village in Foundation | by City Planner Plays</h2><div><h3><i>A step-by-step guide based on City Planner Plays\' gameplay.</i></h3></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><span><a name="more"></a></span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><u>1.

From meticulously planning road layouts in Cities: Skylines to managing survival in Frostpunk, I love the challenge of building something from the ground up.&nbsp;<p></p><p>But <a href="https://www.polymorph.games/en/" target="_blank">Polymorph Game</a>\'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/690830/Foundation/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> feels different.</p><p>After finally diving in over the weekend—despite having picked it up in Early Access in 2023—I found myself completely losing track of time. Somehow, four hours vanished out of thin air. The way villages grow organically, without a rigid grid, gives the game a unique feel, and balancing resources and villager needs is incredibly rewarding. Add in its gorgeous visuals, and I can already tell this is a city-builder I’ll be spending a lot more time with.</p><p>Of course, learning a new game like Foundation can be a challenge, and that’s where great content creators make all the difference. I’ve followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CityPlannerPlays" target="_blank">City Planner Plays</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://@cityplannerplays.bsky.social">@cityplannerplays.bsky.social</a>) for years—first for his Cities: Skylines content and later for his deep-dive How-To guides in other games.

While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step.

While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step. It takes the grand, operatic elements of Star Wars and grounds them in a reality where power is brutal, where ecological concerns dictate the survival of entire civilizations, and where messiahs are as dangerous as they are revered.</p><p>While Star Wars draws inspiration from many sources, including Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films, and Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey, the imprint of Dune is undeniable. Lucas mixed multiple influences to craft his space opera, resulting in a faster-paced, action-driven narrative compared to Dune’s more introspective and politically complex storytelling.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened. That bizarre, campy mess deserves to be locked in a vault and yeeted into a black hole. A clone-Ripley with alien DNA? A Xenomorph with puppy dog eyes? No thanks. Some things are best left unacknowledged.</i>).&nbsp;</p><p>And then, decades later, Ridley Scott returned. He promised to answer those burning questions we’d had since Alien. He promised us something epic, something profound.</p><p>Instead, we got <b>Prometheus </b>and <b>Alien: Covenant</b>—films that thought they were profound, but mostly just left us shaking our heads, wondering how some of the dumbest people in the universe got sent on space missions.</p><p>Let’s talk about the prequels.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Prometheus: A Beautiful, Dumb Mystery</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/s1200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/w400-h200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p>Prometheus promised us a grand exploration of the origins of life and the Xenomorphs, wrapped in a sleek, high-concept sci-fi package. And visually? It delivered. The ship design was stunning, the interior dripping with that clean, industrial aesthetic that felt like a spiritual cousin to the Nostromo (well the crew quarters really), only way more advanced. The planetary storm sequence? Pure spectacle.&nbsp;</p><p>The Engineers?&nbsp;</p><p>Towering and mysterious—though, let’s be real, their proportions felt wonky, as if Ridley Scott couldn\'t quite decide whether they were gods or just really tall dudes in marble skin suits. <i>Do yourself a favour—go rewatch the scene where the crew of the Nostromo first stumbles upon the Space Jockey. Take a good look at the proportions. That thing is massive, ancient, and downright eerie. Now ask yourself: does an Engineer really seem big enough to fit that chair? Yeah, I didn’t think so either.</i></p><p></p><p>Performance-wise, Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron carried the film on their backs. Rapace brought intensity to her role as Elizabeth Shaw, a scientist driven by faith and curiosity, while Fassbender’s David was the perfect blend of unsettling and fascinating—an android more human than the humans around him. And Theron? Her cold, corporate badassery added a delicious layer of tension.</p><p>But for all the things "Prometheus" got right, its flaws loomed as large as the Engineer statues. The whole "our DNA comes from a space giant dissolving in a river" premise felt half-baked at best, eye-roll-inducing at worst. If the Engineers were supposed to be our creators, why was there zero effort to explain their motives? Why did they want to wipe out humanity? What was this planet even for? Instead of storytelling, we got vague hints and unanswered questions wrapped in pseudo-philosophical musings.</p><p>Then there was the crew—easily the dumbest collection of scientists and astronauts ever put on screen. Removing helmets in an alien environment? Playing "here, kitty kitty" with a clearly hostile alien snake thing? These people made the space truckers from Alien look like Nobel Prize winners. And the mutations—ugh. Fifield’s transformation into a rabid space zombie was laughably bad, and don’t even get me started on the grotesque, beige "proto-Alien" at the end. It looked like a half-melted action figure.</p><p>Oh, and that rolling Engineer ship? The fact that Vickers—who had been competent up until that moment—somehow forgot to run sideways and got pancaked was the cherry on top of this frustrating mess.</p><p>"Prometheus" was a film of incredible potential, weighed down by weak storytelling and infuriatingly dumb character decisions. It gave us glimpses of something greater but never had the courage to actually show us anything meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p>Visually breathtaking, thematically ambitious, but ultimately… a beautifully designed pile of nonsense.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Alien: Covenant: A Gore-Soaked, Half-Baked Hybrid</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/s1296/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/w400-h225/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>If <b>Prometheus </b>was Ridley Scott\'s attempt at deep, existential sci-fi, <b>Alien: Covenant</b> was his half-hearted apology to fans who just wanted some classic Xenomorph carnage. And to be fair, it sort of delivered. We got facehuggers, chestbursters, and plenty of gruesome deaths. But at what cost? The film felt like it was straddling two worlds—trying to bridge the philosophical musings of Prometheus with the horror elements of Alien—and it never really nailed either.</p><p></p><p>Let’s start with the good. Visually, Covenant was just as slick as its predecessor, with some beautifully haunting cinematography. The ship design was solid, the eerie desolation of the Engineer city was striking, and the alien-infested sequences had some intense, gory payoff. And, once again, Michael Fassbender absolutely crushed it—his dual role as the psychotic David and the more naive Walter was easily the most compelling part of the movie. The flute scene? Weird, but Fassbender made it work. "I\'ll do the fingering" may have been unintentionally hilarious, but it also cemented David as one of the most fascinatingly twisted characters in the franchise.</p><p>But then we get to the problems—and, oh boy, there are many.&nbsp;</p><p>The crew? Somehow even dumber than the ones in Prometheus. These were colonists tasked with establishing a new human home, yet they made every idiotic decision possible. Landing on an uncharted planet without hazmat suits? Poking at alien life forms again? Splitting up the team when they know there’s a hostile presence? It was like watching a slasher movie where the victims are actively trying to get themselves killed.</p><p>The Xenomorphs? They felt… off. The Neomorphs were creepy, but they never really lived up to the terror of the original creatures. And when we finally got to a full-fledged Xenomorph, the CGI just didn\'t have the same weight or presence as the practical effects from Alien and Aliens. Instead of lurking in the shadows, dripping menace, the creature just kind of… sprinted around like a hyperactive dog.</p><p>And then there was that twist. We all saw it coming a mile away—David taking Walter’s place—yet the movie played it like some grand revelation.

Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened. That bizarre, campy mess deserves to be locked in a vault and yeeted into a black hole. A clone-Ripley with alien DNA? A Xenomorph with puppy dog eyes? No thanks. Some things are best left unacknowledged.</i>).&nbsp;</p><p>And then, decades later, Ridley Scott returned. He promised to answer those burning questions we’d had since Alien. He promised us something epic, something profound.</p><p>Instead, we got <b>Prometheus </b>and <b>Alien: Covenant</b>—films that thought they were profound, but mostly just left us shaking our heads, wondering how some of the dumbest people in the universe got sent on space missions.</p><p>Let’s talk about the prequels.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Prometheus: A Beautiful, Dumb Mystery</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/s1200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/w400-h200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p>Prometheus promised us a grand exploration of the origins of life and the Xenomorphs, wrapped in a sleek, high-concept sci-fi package. And visually? It delivered. The ship design was stunning, the interior dripping with that clean, industrial aesthetic that felt like a spiritual cousin to the Nostromo (well the crew quarters really), only way more advanced. The planetary storm sequence? Pure spectacle.&nbsp;</p><p>The Engineers?&nbsp;</p><p>Towering and mysterious—though, let’s be real, their proportions felt wonky, as if Ridley Scott couldn\'t quite decide whether they were gods or just really tall dudes in marble skin suits. <i>Do yourself a favour—go rewatch the scene where the crew of the Nostromo first stumbles upon the Space Jockey. Take a good look at the proportions. That thing is massive, ancient, and downright eerie. Now ask yourself: does an Engineer really seem big enough to fit that chair? Yeah, I didn’t think so either.</i></p><p></p><p>Performance-wise, Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron carried the film on their backs. Rapace brought intensity to her role as Elizabeth Shaw, a scientist driven by faith and curiosity, while Fassbender’s David was the perfect blend of unsettling and fascinating—an android more human than the humans around him. And Theron? Her cold, corporate badassery added a delicious layer of tension.</p><p>But for all the things "Prometheus" got right, its flaws loomed as large as the Engineer statues. The whole "our DNA comes from a space giant dissolving in a river" premise felt half-baked at best, eye-roll-inducing at worst. If the Engineers were supposed to be our creators, why was there zero effort to explain their motives? Why did they want to wipe out humanity? What was this planet even for? Instead of storytelling, we got vague hints and unanswered questions wrapped in pseudo-philosophical musings.</p><p>Then there was the crew—easily the dumbest collection of scientists and astronauts ever put on screen. Removing helmets in an alien environment? Playing "here, kitty kitty" with a clearly hostile alien snake thing? These people made the space truckers from Alien look like Nobel Prize winners. And the mutations—ugh. Fifield’s transformation into a rabid space zombie was laughably bad, and don’t even get me started on the grotesque, beige "proto-Alien" at the end. It looked like a half-melted action figure.</p><p>Oh, and that rolling Engineer ship? The fact that Vickers—who had been competent up until that moment—somehow forgot to run sideways and got pancaked was the cherry on top of this frustrating mess.</p><p>"Prometheus" was a film of incredible potential, weighed down by weak storytelling and infuriatingly dumb character decisions. It gave us glimpses of something greater but never had the courage to actually show us anything meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p>Visually breathtaking, thematically ambitious, but ultimately… a beautifully designed pile of nonsense.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Alien: Covenant: A Gore-Soaked, Half-Baked Hybrid</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/s1296/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/w400-h225/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>If <b>Prometheus </b>was Ridley Scott\'s attempt at deep, existential sci-fi, <b>Alien: Covenant</b> was his half-hearted apology to fans who just wanted some classic Xenomorph carnage. And to be fair, it sort of delivered. We got facehuggers, chestbursters, and plenty of gruesome deaths. But at what cost? The film felt like it was straddling two worlds—trying to bridge the philosophical musings of Prometheus with the horror elements of Alien—and it never really nailed either.</p><p></p><p>Let’s start with the good. Visually, Covenant was just as slick as its predecessor, with some beautifully haunting cinematography. The ship design was solid, the eerie desolation of the Engineer city was striking, and the alien-infested sequences had some intense, gory payoff. And, once again, Michael Fassbender absolutely crushed it—his dual role as the psychotic David and the more naive Walter was easily the most compelling part of the movie. The flute scene? Weird, but Fassbender made it work. "I\'ll do the fingering" may have been unintentionally hilarious, but it also cemented David as one of the most fascinatingly twisted characters in the franchise.</p><p>But then we get to the problems—and, oh boy, there are many.&nbsp;</p><p>The crew? Somehow even dumber than the ones in Prometheus. These were colonists tasked with establishing a new human home, yet they made every idiotic decision possible. Landing on an uncharted planet without hazmat suits? Poking at alien life forms again? Splitting up the team when they know there’s a hostile presence? It was like watching a slasher movie where the victims are actively trying to get themselves killed.</p><p>The Xenomorphs? They felt… off. The Neomorphs were creepy, but they never really lived up to the terror of the original creatures. And when we finally got to a full-fledged Xenomorph, the CGI just didn\'t have the same weight or presence as the practical effects from Alien and Aliens. Instead of lurking in the shadows, dripping menace, the creature just kind of… sprinted around like a hyperactive dog.</p><p>And then there was that twist. We all saw it coming a mile away—David taking Walter’s place—yet the movie played it like some grand revelation. The final scene, with Daniels realizing the truth as David smugly locked her into cryosleep, had so much potential to be chilling. But it was frustrating because it was just another rehash of the same “crew doomed by their own stupidity” trope we’d already seen before.</p><p><b>Alien: Covenant</b> had all the ingredients of a great sci-fi horror film, but it never fully committed to either its horror roots or its philosophical ambitions.

Notable sci-fi classics like <b>Blade Runner</b> (1982) &amp; <b>Blade Runner 2049</b> (2018), <b>The Matrix</b> (1999), and <b>Inception</b> (2010) received acclaim for their groundbreaking visuals and storytelling but were largely confined to technical awards. For instance, <b>The Matrix</b> won four Oscars, all in technical categories, without nominations for Best Picture or Best Director.&nbsp;\u200b2018\'s <b>Blade Runner 2049</b> won for Best Visual Effects and Best Cinematography, but wasn\'t even nominated for Best Picture, nor Best Director.</p><span><a name="more"></a></span><p>A significant breakthrough occurred in 2023 when <b>Everything Everywhere All at Once</b> became the first sci-fi film to win Best Picture. How this movie and not Dune Part One won the Oscar for Best Movie, is beyond me. Nevertheless, this marked a departure from the Academy\'s traditional preferences, signaling a potential shift in recognizing the genre\'s broader contributions.&nbsp;\u200b</p><p>The Dune franchise, based on Frank Herbert\'s seminal 1965 novel, has experienced a similar pattern. <b>Dune: Part One</b> (2021) garnered six Oscars, all in technical categories, including Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, but missed out on Best Picture and Best Director. <b>Dune: Part Two</b> continued this trend with its two technical wins.&nbsp;\u200b</p><p>The consistent relegation of sci-fi films to technical categories suggests a broader industry perception that views these works primarily as showcases for technological innovation rather than as vehicles for profound storytelling or artistic expression. This perspective overlooks the genre\'s capacity to explore complex themes, envision alternative realities, and challenge societal norms.\u200b</p><p>Despite these challenges, there are signs of change. The success of Everything Everywhere All at Once in major categories indicates a growing appreciation for sci-fi narratives. Then again, I\'m wondering if the "comedy" aspect of that movie, made it more appealing then the typical serious science fiction movie.

While these awards recognize the film\'s technical excellence, they also highlight the Academy\'s historical tendency to limit recognition of science fiction (sci-fi) films to technical categories, often overlooking them in major awards such as Best Picture, Best Director, and acting categories.\u200b</p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p>Historically, the <b>Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</b> has shown reluctance in honoring sci-fi films in major categories. Notable sci-fi classics like <b>Blade Runner</b> (1982) &amp; <b>Blade Runner 2049</b> (2018), <b>The Matrix</b> (1999), and <b>Inception</b> (2010) received acclaim for their groundbreaking visuals and storytelling but were largely confined to technical awards. For instance, <b>The Matrix</b> won four Oscars, all in technical categories, without nominations for Best Picture or Best Director.&nbsp;\u200b2018\'s <b>Blade Runner 2049</b> won for Best Visual Effects and Best Cinematography, but wasn\'t even nominated for Best Picture, nor Best Director.</p><span><a name="more"></a></span><p>A significant breakthrough occurred in 2023 when <b>Everything Everywhere All at Once</b> became the first sci-fi film to win Best Picture. How this movie and not Dune Part One won the Oscar for Best Movie, is beyond me. Nevertheless, this marked a departure from the Academy\'s traditional preferences, signaling a potential shift in recognizing the genre\'s broader contributions.&nbsp;\u200b</p><p>The Dune franchise, based on Frank Herbert\'s seminal 1965 novel, has experienced a similar pattern. <b>Dune: Part One</b> (2021) garnered six Oscars, all in technical categories, including Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, but missed out on Best Picture and Best Director. <b>Dune: Part Two</b> continued this trend with its two technical wins.&nbsp;\u200b</p><p>The consistent relegation of sci-fi films to technical categories suggests a broader industry perception that views these works primarily as showcases for technological innovation rather than as vehicles for profound storytelling or artistic expression. This perspective overlooks the genre\'s capacity to explore complex themes, envision alternative realities, and challenge societal norms.\u200b</p><p>Despite these challenges, there are signs of change. The success of Everything Everywhere All at Once in major categories indicates a growing appreciation for sci-fi narratives. Then again, I\'m wondering if the "comedy" aspect of that movie, made it more appealing then the typical serious science fiction movie.

You read that right - his full play through is almost 3 hours long!</p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><p></p><p><br /></p><p>If you don\'t have time to watch the full play through, this guide should give you a solid foundation to build upon, whether they’re new to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a>&nbsp;</em>or are looking to improve their city-building skills.&nbsp;</p><span><a name="more"></a></span><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">1. Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment. Here’s a summary of all six options to help you decide:</p><ul><li><strong>Craftsman:</strong> Increases natural resources by 25%, providing an edge in resource-heavy builds or for cities situated in resource-poor areas.</li><li><strong>Strategist:</strong> Reduces the likelihood of incidents like fires by 20%, keeping your city safe from disasters that can disrupt growth.</li><li><strong>Trader:</strong> Generates passive income from trade routes, a reliable choice if you plan on focusing on a strong economy.</li><li><strong>Politician:</strong> Allows two additional decrees to be issued at a lower cost, giving you more control over civic policies and faster access to certain upgrades.</li><li><strong>Philosopher:</strong> Boosts cultural satisfaction by 15%, making it easier to attract and retain a happy, thriving population.</li><li><strong>Priest:</strong> Citizens make regular offerings of random resources, adding a steady flow of materials that can supplement your supply chain.</li></ul><p>Each path offers distinct benefits depending on your playstyle. For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city.

Developing Infrastructure: Production and Trade Routes</h2><p>Setting up trade routes is essential for generating income and balancing resources as your city expands. In the playthrough, the author wisely establishes trade routes to sell excess stone and sand for gold, which funds additional buildings and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>\' trade and production systems:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure to unlock and build both the Horreum, a large storehouse, as well as the Macellum, a large market which will open up Trade Routes. Without these two buildings trade will not be possible.</li><li>Identify surplus resources.

Check each route’s profitability and ensure you’re getting maximum value from each transaction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">6. Advanced Growth: Reaching the Tier 2 City</h2><p>As your city grows, upgrading to a Tier 2 city brings new buildings and capabilities, allowing for even greater development. However, this stage also introduces new challenges, such as managing faction tensions. Here are a few ways to make the transition smoothly:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Construct safety-focused buildings. Building structures like arenas can help reduce incidents, which become more likely as factions develop tensions.</li><li>Invest in cultural influence points. Advancing through the ages improves your city’s reputation and allows for higher-level upgrades.</li><li>Manage faction relations. Keep an eye on faction satisfaction levels and address issues before they escalate into conflicts. Certain factions may have different needs or preferences.</li><li>Create additional districts. As new buildings become available, expand your residential and industrial districts to accommodate a growing population.</li><li>Save resources for key upgrades. Some Tier 2 buildings are expensive, so stockpile resources like wood, stone, and gold to avoid delays in construction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">7. Unlocking Wonders and Advanced Cultural Buildings</h2><p>Once you’ve secured your city’s basics, investing in wonders and advanced cultural buildings provides significant boosts. In the video, the author demonstrates how to build high-value structures like the arena and the Agoge Center to enhance influence. Here’s a guide to prioritize wonders effectively:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Focus on the Agoge Center&nbsp;or library to boost cultural influence. These buildings improve city-wide satisfaction and increase your cultural reach.</li><li>Place wonders in high-traffic areas to maximize their impact. Wonders near residential zones offer bonuses to more citizens.</li><li>Consider safety upgrades for wonder districts. Building defensive structures near wonders ensures they’re protected from incidents.</li><li>Save resources for construction. Wonders often require substantial materials, so plan to accumulate what you need before starting.</li><li>Regularly expand surveyor cabins. This allows you to build wonders farther out from the core, increasing your city’s total area.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8. Optimizing Faction Management and Decrees</h2><p>At this stage, you’ll encounter factions with unique demands. Managing these factions carefully, especially if they develop tensions, will become an important of your city management. Use decrees and policies to mitigate conflicts and enhance your city’s stability.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Issue decrees strategically. Certain decrees, such as increased food production, improve citizen satisfaction or reduce faction tensions.</li><li>Manage faction trust levels. High trust prevents conflicts, while low trust increases the likelihood of incidents and disputes.</li><li>Consider faction removal if tensions rise too high. Sometimes, expelling a problematic faction is more beneficial than dealing with constant conflicts.</li><li>Create buffers between rival factions. Placing neutral buildings or parks between contentious factions can reduce interactions and potential conflicts.</li><li>Balance decrees for all factions. Ensure that no single faction feels neglected, as this can quickly lead to dissatisfaction.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2><p>Building a successful city in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;requires a careful blend of resource management, cultural development, and strategic planning.

You read that right - his full play through is almost 3 hours long!</p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><p></p><p><br /></p><p>If you don\'t have time to watch the full play through, this guide should give you a solid foundation to build upon, whether they’re new to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a>&nbsp;</em>or are looking to improve their city-building skills.&nbsp;</p><span><a name="more"></a></span><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">1. Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment. Here’s a summary of all six options to help you decide:</p><ul><li><strong>Craftsman:</strong> Increases natural resources by 25%, providing an edge in resource-heavy builds or for cities situated in resource-poor areas.</li><li><strong>Strategist:</strong> Reduces the likelihood of incidents like fires by 20%, keeping your city safe from disasters that can disrupt growth.</li><li><strong>Trader:</strong> Generates passive income from trade routes, a reliable choice if you plan on focusing on a strong economy.</li><li><strong>Politician:</strong> Allows two additional decrees to be issued at a lower cost, giving you more control over civic policies and faster access to certain upgrades.</li><li><strong>Philosopher:</strong> Boosts cultural satisfaction by 15%, making it easier to attract and retain a happy, thriving population.</li><li><strong>Priest:</strong> Citizens make regular offerings of random resources, adding a steady flow of materials that can supplement your supply chain.</li></ul><p>Each path offers distinct benefits depending on your playstyle. For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city. Here’s how to create a well-rounded cultural hub:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Add the ceramic workshop to a district close to residential zones, maximizing its impact on citizen satisfaction.</li><li>Balance satisfaction areas carefully: Focus on health and creativity early on to keep citizens productive and happy.</li><li>Use decorative statues within districts. Strategically placed statues improve attraction and encourage population growth.</li><li>Expand the radius of cultural buildings. When feasible, prioritize cultural buildings that have a broader impact radius to maximize their effectiveness.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">5.

No need to worry about respawning in an FPS firefight or letting your team down in the middle of a MOBA match (I could write a whole posts on all the insults I\'ve taken from World of Tanks players).&nbsp;</p><p>These game wait for you, not the other way around.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Meditative Moments in Gaming</h3><p>Additionally, city-building games offer something incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world: a sense of peace and mindfulness. There’s a certain meditative quality to watching your city grow, whether it\'s a bustling metropolis in Cities: Skylines or a fragile colony on the brink of collapse in Frostpunk. You’re not just reacting to what’s happening on screen; you’re crafting something from the ground up, watching your creation evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s like a digital Zen garden, where each decision is a small stone you’re placing just so, bringing order to the chaos. Oh the hundreds of hours I\'ve spent in my Cities Skylines cities, beautifying them with parks, trees and endless landscaping.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Building Something That Lasts (well, sorta)</h3><p>Speaking of crafting, there’s something deeply satisfying about the “building something” aspect of these games. Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge.

I decided to pull together some straightforward tips and tricks to keep me from making the same mistakes next time. Along the way, I stumbled upon some cool playthroughs that actually showed me what I should be doing. The guide below is what came out of that little project.&nbsp;</p><p>Hope it helps you dodge the newbie moves and maybe even enjoy the game a bit more. Let’s get back in there and show them what we’ve got!</p><p><br /></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">World of Tanks || Super Hellcat - Tank Review</h2><span><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"></div></span><span><a name="more"></a></span><h2 style="text-align: left;">Playing the Super Hellcat</h2><p>Playing as a Tank Destroyer (TD) in World of Tanks, particularly with vehicles like the Super Hellcat and Hellcat, requires a good mix of tactical awareness, map knowledge, and understanding of the vehicle\'s strengths and weaknesses. Someone with extensive experience piloting TDs would likely tell you that the following are the best setups, crew skills, and playstyle strategies to help your team secure victory.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Vehicle Setup in Detail</h3><h4 style="text-align: left;">Equipment Choices</h4><p>For both the Hellcat and Super Hellcat, the goal is to maximize their strengths: mobility, concealment, and firepower.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Optics (Binocular Telescope or Coated Optics)</b>: Increasing your view range is critical. Spotting enemies before they spot you allows you to make informed decisions on when to shoot and when to relocate. The choice between Binocular Telescope and Coated Optics depends on your playstyle; Binoculars for more stationary play and Coated Optics for more active scouting and repositioning.</li><li><b>Gun Rammer</b>: Reducing your reload time significantly increases your Damage Per Minute (DPM), making you a bigger threat on the battlefield. Being able to shoot more frequently means you can exploit enemy tanks\' vulnerabilities more often.</li><li><b>Camo Net / Turbocharger</b>: The choice here is between enhancing your stealth with a Camo Net or boosting your mobility with a Turbocharger.

Here’s a breakdown of which vehicles a Hellcat should consider partnering with and why:</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Medium Tanks</h3><div>Medium tanks are versatile and can perform a wide range of roles, making them excellent partners for the Hellcat. Their balance of speed, armor, and firepower allows them to effectively scout, flank, and engage enemies at various ranges. A Hellcat can support medium tanks by providing additional firepower from a second line or by exploiting openings created by the mediums’ aggressive maneuvers. This pairing can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions, moving to support weakened flanks or to capitalize on enemy vulnerabilities.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heavy Tanks</h3><div>While heavy tanks lack the Hellcat’s mobility, they make up for it with superior armor and firepower. Teaming up with heavy tanks allows the Hellcat to operate from behind the frontline, using the heavies as a shield while it delivers precise shots. This partnership is especially effective in areas with good cover and long sightlines, where the Hellcat can use its excellent gun to support the heavy tanks without exposing itself to enemy fire. The Hellcat should avoid blocking the retreat paths of allied heavy tanks and remain ready to reposition if the enemy breaks through the frontline.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Other TDs</h3><div>Pairing with other TDs, especially those with strong frontal armor, can create a formidable defensive line that can deter enemy advances. The Hellcat, with its good mobility, can act as a scout or flanker for this group, identifying targets for the more heavily armored TDs to engage. However, this requires good communication and coordination to ensure that the Hellcat does not become isolated or targeted by enemy artillery.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Artillery</h3><div>While not directly tagging along with artillery, a Hellcat can play a crucial role in protecting these valuable assets from enemy scouts and light tanks. By staying relatively close to friendly artillery, the Hellcat can use its mobility and firepower to intercept and eliminate threats to the team’s artillery pieces, ensuring they can continue to support the team effectively.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Light Tanks</h3><div>A somewhat less common but potentially effective partnership can be formed with light tanks. Light tanks excel in scouting and can quickly identify key enemy positions. A Hellcat following a light tank at a safe distance can capitalize on the scouting information, using its accurate gun to take out spotted enemies before they can react. However, this requires the Hellcat to stay alert and ready to move, as the light tank’s fast-paced scouting can lead them into rapidly changing situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>When pairing with any vehicle, the key for the Hellcat driver is to maintain situational awareness and adapt to the battle’s flow. The Hellcat\'s strength lies in its ability to deliver impactful damage from positions where it is not easily targeted. Effective communication with teammates and choosing the right moments to strike or relocate are crucial for leveraging the Hellcat’s capabilities to their fullest.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">How NOT to play the Super Hellcat!</h2></span></div><p style="text-align: left;">One of the worst ways to play the Hellcat in World of Tanks is to treat it like a frontline brawler or a heavy tank. The Hellcat is equipped with a powerful gun and excellent mobility but suffers from very thin armor and a relatively open turret design, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fire from almost all types of weapons it encounters on the battlefield.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Mistakes in Playing the Hellcat as a Frontline Tank:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Engaging in Direct Firefights: Attempting to trade shots with enemy tanks, especially heavies or well-armored mediums and TDs, is a quick way to get destroyed. The Hellcat\'s armor is insufficient to absorb hits, and its relatively large profile for a TD makes it an easy target when exposed.</li><li>Ignoring Cover and Concealment: Failing to use the terrain, bushes, and other forms of cover to hide your tank and mask your movements negates one of the Hellcat\'s main strengths – its ability to strike unseen. Being visible on the front lines means you\'ll likely be one of the first targets to be fired upon.</li><li>Static Gameplay: Staying in one position for too long, especially on the front lines, can make you an easy target for enemy artillery and tanks. The Hellcat thrives on its ability to relocate quickly, providing support where it\'s needed and avoiding return fire.</li><li>Not Using its Mobility: The Hellcat\'s speed is a key feature that allows it to flex across the map, responding to threats, reinforcing failing flanks, or exploiting gaps in the enemy lines. Playing it in a stationary, frontline role wastes this potential, making the tank much less effective than it could be.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Avoid These Mistakes:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Play to Your Strengths: Use the Hellcat\'s mobility and excellent gun handling to engage enemies from unexpected angles, relocate frequently to avoid being targeted, and always look for opportunities to support your team from a distance or the second line.</li><li>Stay Aware: Keep an eye on the mini-map and be ready to move if you\'re in danger of being flanked, or if there\'s a more advantageous position you can take to support your team.</li><li>Engage Wisely: Choose your battles carefully. Look for targets that are engaged with your teammates, isolated, or presenting their weaker armor to you. Avoid head-on engagements with tanks that can easily outgun or outarmor you.</li></ul><p></p><p>By avoiding the frontline brawler playstyle and focusing on mobility, stealth, and strategic engagement, you\'ll greatly increase your effectiveness and survivability in the Hellcat, turning it into a formidable asset for your team.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final thoughts...</h2><p>Mastering the Hellcat and Super Hellcat requires patience, good positioning, and an understanding of when to engage or retreat. Remember, your primary role is to support your team by providing accurate and timely damage from a distance or flanking. Avoid direct confrontations with heavier tanks unless you have a clear advantage or support. By following these strategies and adjusting your playstyle based on the battle\'s flow, you\'ll become a valuable asset to your team and help secure victory on the battlefield.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p>Jumping back into World of Tanks after long hiatus, and a big update felt a bit like a cold splash of water yesterday - especially when I dove straight into battle with my Super Hellcat and ended up more like a skittish kitten hiding in the bushes (literally) than the fierce TD I should\'ve been.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, my gameplay was rusty, and the match didn’t go well at all.

This time around, the F/X team, under <a href="https://www.artofvfx.com/dune-part-two/" target="_blank">Paul Lambert\u200b\'s direction</a>, is expected to push the boundaries further, bringing to life the epic battles and the awe-inspiring sandworms with even more detail and realism.</p><p>As for the future of the Dune franchise, speculation is rife. With Part Two likely to cover the remainder of the first book, fans are eagerly discussing the possibility of Villeneuve tackling Dune Messiah - as he had indicated that he would not continue beyond a third film. Given his success with the franchise so far, the prospect of Villeneuve continuing to guide the saga is an exciting one - whether behind the camera or as an executive producer. His vision has redefined what epic science fiction cinema can be (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049), and the potential for further exploring the rich universe of Dune under his direction is a tantalizing prospect.</p><p>Dune: Part Two isn\'t just a movie to me, and to most Dune fans; it\'s an event. And hopefully the continuation of a whole new and fresh movie franchise. With its compelling storyline, Villeneuve\'s visionary direction, Zimmer\'s haunting score, and jaw-dropping F/X, the film is set to be a cinematic landmark. As I look to the future, the possibility of continuing this journey through the Dune saga with Villeneuve at the helm is a prospect that fills us with anticipation.&nbsp;</p><p>So, grab your stillsuit and prepare to walk the sands of Arrakis once again - I\'ll be doing so tonight (minus the stillsuit of course!😆)</p><p>The universe of Dune awaits, and its mysteries are more compelling than ever.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/the-sands-of-arrakis-beckon-again-dune.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/the-sands-of-arrakis-beckon-again-dune.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://img.youtube.com/vi/VC7-OcFvVEw/default.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

Tolkien remains a figure of intriguing complexity, and in some cases contradiction. As a devout Roman Catholic and a lover of Roman languages, Tolkien\'s aversion to the Roman Empire stands out as a remarkable paradox. As one explores Tolkien\'s complex relationship with the Roman Empire and its influence on his work, one cannot deny his deep-seated values of localism and traditionalism.</p><p></p><blockquote><i>In Tolkien\'s Middle-earth, we find a reflection of his ideological battle—a world where the preservation of diversity stands as a testament to the resilience of local cultures against the tides of conquest and cultural erasure.</i></blockquote><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Tolkien\'s Ideological Conflict</h2><p>At the heart of Tolkien\'s paradoxical stance is his deep admiration for the Roman people and their culture juxtaposed with his disdain for the Roman Empire. This aversion did not stem from a dislike of Roman achievements in engineering, governance, or the arts, but from the empire\'s approach to conquest and cultural eradication. Tolkien, despite his affection for Latin and Roman Catholicism, viewed the empire as antithetical to his cherished principles of localism and traditionalism.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Influence of the Roman Empire on Tolkien\'s Work</h2><p>The shadow of the Roman Empire looms subtly over Tolkien\'s Middle-earth, with the city of <b>Minas Tirith</b> drawing inspiration from the historical <b>Constantinople</b> and themes of decline echoing the fall of ancient civilizations. However, Tolkien\'s engagement with these inspirations does not translate into an outright admiration for the empire\'s historical actions. Instead, he repurposes elements of Roman history and mythology to enrich his fictional world, all the while embedding a critique of imperialism and cultural homogenization.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">A Champion of Localism and Traditionalism</h2><p>Tolkien\'s ideology was profoundly rooted in a love for <b>England</b>, a preference for localized, distinct cultures, and languages. His opposition to the <b>Roman Empire</b>\'s empire-building and suppression of local traditions stems from this deep-seated belief. Through his writings and personal letters, Tolkien consistently advocated for the preservation of local customs, languages, and independence, opposing any form of imperialism that threatened these values. His narrative worlds are testament to his belief in the coexistence of diverse cultures and the preservation of their unique identities.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Reflecting Ideals Through Middle-earth</h2><p>Middle-earth serves as a canvas for Tolkien to articulate his ideals. The coexistence of distinct cultures, languages, and traditions within Middle-earth mirrors Tolkien\'s opposition to the homogenizing force of empires. Characters and societies in his work often face threats from forces seeking to dominate and erase diversity, reflecting Tolkien\'s critique of imperialism. Through his fictional narratives, Tolkien advocates for a world where diversity is not only preserved but celebrated.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Latin, Catholicism, and Cultural Unity</h2><p>Tolkien\'s advocacy for the use of Latin in Catholic services might seem contradictory to his localist views at first glance. However, Tolkien saw Latin as a unifying element of the Catholic Church, one that connected its history to the present without undermining local languages and cultures. His stance is a nuanced one that distinguishes between cultural appreciation and political dominion.

Tolkien remains a figure of intriguing complexity, and in some cases contradiction. As a devout Roman Catholic and a lover of Roman languages, Tolkien\'s aversion to the Roman Empire stands out as a remarkable paradox. As one explores Tolkien\'s complex relationship with the Roman Empire and its influence on his work, one cannot deny his deep-seated values of localism and traditionalism.</p><p></p><blockquote><i>In Tolkien\'s Middle-earth, we find a reflection of his ideological battle—a world where the preservation of diversity stands as a testament to the resilience of local cultures against the tides of conquest and cultural erasure.</i></blockquote><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Tolkien\'s Ideological Conflict</h2><p>At the heart of Tolkien\'s paradoxical stance is his deep admiration for the Roman people and their culture juxtaposed with his disdain for the Roman Empire. This aversion did not stem from a dislike of Roman achievements in engineering, governance, or the arts, but from the empire\'s approach to conquest and cultural eradication. Tolkien, despite his affection for Latin and Roman Catholicism, viewed the empire as antithetical to his cherished principles of localism and traditionalism.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Influence of the Roman Empire on Tolkien\'s Work</h2><p>The shadow of the Roman Empire looms subtly over Tolkien\'s Middle-earth, with the city of <b>Minas Tirith</b> drawing inspiration from the historical <b>Constantinople</b> and themes of decline echoing the fall of ancient civilizations. However, Tolkien\'s engagement with these inspirations does not translate into an outright admiration for the empire\'s historical actions. Instead, he repurposes elements of Roman history and mythology to enrich his fictional world, all the while embedding a critique of imperialism and cultural homogenization.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">A Champion of Localism and Traditionalism</h2><p>Tolkien\'s ideology was profoundly rooted in a love for <b>England</b>, a preference for localized, distinct cultures, and languages. His opposition to the <b>Roman Empire</b>\'s empire-building and suppression of local traditions stems from this deep-seated belief. Through his writings and personal letters, Tolkien consistently advocated for the preservation of local customs, languages, and independence, opposing any form of imperialism that threatened these values. His narrative worlds are testament to his belief in the coexistence of diverse cultures and the preservation of their unique identities.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Reflecting Ideals Through Middle-earth</h2><p>Middle-earth serves as a canvas for Tolkien to articulate his ideals. The coexistence of distinct cultures, languages, and traditions within Middle-earth mirrors Tolkien\'s opposition to the homogenizing force of empires. Characters and societies in his work often face threats from forces seeking to dominate and erase diversity, reflecting Tolkien\'s critique of imperialism. Through his fictional narratives, Tolkien advocates for a world where diversity is not only preserved but celebrated.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Latin, Catholicism, and Cultural Unity</h2><p>Tolkien\'s advocacy for the use of Latin in Catholic services might seem contradictory to his localist views at first glance. However, Tolkien saw Latin as a unifying element of the Catholic Church, one that connected its history to the present without undermining local languages and cultures. His stance is a nuanced one that distinguishes between cultural appreciation and political dominion. For Tolkien, Latin represented a spiritual and cultural heritage that transcended the political ambitions of the Roman Empire, aligning with his vision of a world united in diversity rather than uniformity.</p><p style="text-align: center;">*********************************</p><p>Tolkien\'s paradoxical stance on the Roman Empire reflects a complex interplay of admiration and aversion, deeply intertwined with his values and beliefs.
