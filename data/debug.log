As I think I mentioned I&#8217;m going to suspend the formal learning journey once I finish this course, and circle back to it after we&#8217;re in the new place. I just need to unload some of my daily tasks to make room for all the moving headaches.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t been doing much else, either. Have been letting my AI learning fall by the wayside as well. But that&#8217;s OK; I&#8217;ll get back to it.</p>\n<p>PS: I did notice the hand in the image at the top of this post has 6 fingers but since it was a Halloween-based image it seemed fine to have it like that. Anyone else old enough to remember Chiller Theater that had the introduction with that 6 fingered hand that came up out of the ground and grabbed the letters off the logo one by one?</p>\n<h2>Tuesday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course (Python Code Challenges), Sub-Module 4</h3>\n<p>Syntax continues to screw me up, particularly switching between Lists and Dictionaries. But I always know what I want and need to do, I just frequently have to look up the right syntax. But that&#8217;s just part of learning a new language, I guess.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Wednesday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course (Python Code Challenges), Sub-Module 5</h3>\n<p>This finished up the Pyton 3 Course and CodeCademy suggested a few next steps. One was Intermediate Python which makes the most sense, but I&#8217;m instead going to go into Build Chatbots with Python since AI-related stuff is a big part of why I&#8217;m learning Python, AND it sounds fun (it&#8217;s marked as &#8220;Beginner&#8221; level) and something stress-free I can mess around with while we&#8217;re doing this move. </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Thursday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Build Chatbots With Python, Modules 1 &#8211; 4 </h3>\n<p>Turns out at some point I&#8217;d started this course which definitely get my a leg up on my progress!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Friday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Build Chatbots With Python, Modules Who Knows?</h3>\n<p>So it turns out CodeCademy re-uses modules within a subject, so as I moved through the Chatbots course I kept landing on things I&#8217;d already completed. Plus, the course seems out of date, which is understandable given how fast AI progress is moving. I was thinking Chatbot like something driven by AI and LLM, but this is more about scripted chatbots so far. Like &#8220;Write a program that takes a coffee order&#8221; via the user picking from a list of items. </p>\n<p>I think this might be where CodeCademy and I part ways and I just start building things on my own, but we&#8217;ll see. I have the weekend to think about it. I&#8217;ll either just start building stuff and learning that way, or I&#8217;ll go back to the Intermediate Python course. This Chatbot course just feels like busy work. On my last exercise I was scolded for using a loop because loops hadn&#8217;t been introduced yet!</p>\n<p>Side Note: Just to really throw my brain into confusion I started messing about with Godot (the open source game dev engine) last night so that&#8217;s yet ANOTHER thing I&#8217;m interested it!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/14/learning-journey-week-of-oct-13th-2025/">Learning Journey, Week of Oct. 13th, 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/14/learning-journey-week-of-oct-13th-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '4'}

I got access to it the other day and have been playing around with it and comparing it to Chrome with Gemini AI.</p>\n<p>First, and scariest, thing I did with it was give it access to my (mostly dormant these days) Gmail account and asked it to help me clean up my inbox. I had a zillion emails from LinkedIn and I asked it to find them all and delete them. It got to work, talking through each step: searching for the emails, clicking Select All. Hitting Delete. Waiting and watching to see if the number when down, then searching again for more and deleting those. It was crazy to watch my browser basically running itself. I could watch the AI clicking buttons and so forth.</p>\n<p>The bad news is that it wasn&#8217;t smart enough to know that in Gmail if you search for emails from a specific address, and change the sort from &#8220;Relevance&#8221; to &#8220;Recent&#8221; you get a prompt to select all emails matching your search and can delete everything at once. To be fair I had to ask Google Gemini how to get to that feature which had apparently disappeared. So I&#8217;m no smarter than Comet.</p>\n<p>So that was cool but also creepy and after I did that test I revoked its access to my Google account. </p>\n<h2>Video Summaries</h2>\n<p>For another test, I was watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivjwcZwMw4&#038;t">1 hour long YouTube video</a> that was an interview that I was vaguely interested in, but not &#8220;one hour of my time&#8221; interested in. I asked Gemini (in Chrome) to summarize the video and it gave me a summary based on, not the video, but the text around the video including the comments. Not helpful. I asked it to summarize the video itself and it told me it couldn&#8217;t watch the video.</p>\n<p>But in Comet I loaded the same YouTube video and asked Comet to summarize the video itself. It did so, and as I&#8217;d watched about half the video I know that it was a good summary of at least the first half. Here&#8217;s the full text of Comet&#8217;s summary:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nHere’s a summary of the main points from the video “AI killed Hollywood | Amazon&#8217;s secret AI bet | Ed Saatchi&#8217;s scary prediction”:</p>\n<p>&#8211; **AI is Creating a New Medium for Entertainment:** Edward Saatchi argues that AI isn&#8217;t just a tool for cheaper VFX or content automation; it&#8217;s giving birth to a completely new artistic medium. This medium is *playable*, *remixable*, and *multiplayer*—where audiences and creators can interact with AI-driven story worlds, create new episodes/characters, and expand existing universes, not just consume stitched clips.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **From Modding Games to Modding Movies:** The talk highlights parallels to video game modding—fans remixing and spinning off their own stories—which may change how film/TV IP is used, giving fans and creators more freedom to create derivative works inside established worlds, all monetized by the original IP holder.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Simulation Is Key to Realism:** Saatchi stresses that realistic AI storytelling requires true simulation—persistent worlds where characters have context, rules, relationships, and logical spatial/geographical structure (unlike current generative video, which often lacks consistency). These simulated worlds are what make emotional investment possible.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Fragmentation and Remix Culture:** The future of media is described as fragmentary and multiversal, with endless remixing. Everybody could have their own Star Trek or Friends spin-off, leading to a more individualized but potentially atomized culture.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **AI as an Artist and Competitor:** Rather than just being a creative assistant, AI can now independently generate art and narrative, making it a *competitor* to human artists. Human creators become worldbuilders—designing the universe, constraints, and rules that AI uses to generate content.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Navigating Social Media and AI:** As AI-driven personalized storytelling evolves, it may converge with social media, potentially amplifying both creativity and existing concerns—like recommendation algorithms, echo chambers, and digital social dynamics.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Playable Movies/TV and Genre Innovation:** There’s new potential for interactive genres like *playable horror*, where the viewer’s choices and prompts directly affect the story. Comedy and romance are also seen as ripe for AI-driven experimentation.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Technical Challenges:** The conversation notes that current AI-generated voices lack emotional depth, and long-term coherence in video simulation is still a challenge. Simulation here is not just about physics or aesthetics, but about character psychology and emergent, believable storylines.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Advice for Creators:** Saatchi predicts future “studios” will be AI model creators (OpenAI, Grok, Claude, etc.) and that artistic opportunity lies in treating these models as works of art, infusing them with taste and locked-in story elements.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Philosophical and Sci-Fi Visions:** The discussion connects to sci-fi themes (like Iain M. Banks’ Culture series), the possibility of AI-generated consciousness, and how simulations could serve both as entertainment and avenues for advancing creative AGI.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Genre and Format Disruption:** AI may birth new genres, blend existing ones, and enable deeper audience participation (especially in horror and micro-drama formats).</p>\n<p>Overall, the video is a wide-ranging conversation about how AI will disrupt, transform, and expand the boundaries of storytelling, media, and creativity—beyond just Hollywood, into entirely new artistic universes and experiences, with big implications for culture, industry, and society.[1]</p>\n<p>[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivjwcZwMw4&#038;t=1224s)\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what it actually looks like (click to enlarge):<br />\n<a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comet_video.jpg"><img alt="Screenshot of Comet browser summarizing a video" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-278" height="1364" src="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comet_video.jpg" width="1689" /></a></p>\n<p>So note one of the summaries talks about &#8220;playable horror&#8221; (not a new concept for gamers!) and I asked Comet to find that bit in the video, and it did:</p>\n<p><em>The video discusses playable horror starting at the 51:44 mark. If you want to watch that segment, jump to 51:44 in the video—that’s when the topic “Playable Horror: The Next Genre?” begins.</em></p>\n<p>Now this video does have chapters and Playable Horror is the name of a chapter, so hard to say if it got this info from the video or from the chapter listing. So I gave it another test. At one point the guest was talking about the TV show Friends and mentioned Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment. So I asked Comet to find the segment where they talk about Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment, without mentioning the TV show. I was not disappointed:</p>\n<p><em>The discussion about Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment from Friends begins around 12:18 in the video. Edward Saatchi uses it as an example to explain why simulations are important for AI-generated content. To catch this part, start watching at 12 minutes and 18 seconds.</em></p>\n<h2>Shopping</h2>\n<p>OK, one last test: Shopping! First, I had already logged into Amazon.com on the browser. I should&#8217;ve tested without having done that but here was my prompt:</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m almost out of Old Fashioned ingredients. Can you go to Amazon and put Orange Bitters, Peninsula Cherries and Collins Orange Twists in my cart? These should all be found in my previous orders so should be easy to find</strong></p>\n<p>It went to work searching my order history for these items, finding them and adding them to my cart. When it had all 3 in the cart it asked if I wanted it to complete the purchase. I said yes, and then had to agree again before it actually pressed the &#8220;Submit Order&#8221; button and then I got this:</p>\n<p><em>Your order has been successfully placed on Amazon with overnight delivery for all three cocktail ingredients—Collins Orange Twists, Peninsula Cherries, and Fee Brothers Orange Bitters. You’ll receive a confirmation email, and the order will be delivered to your default address by 4–8 AM tomorrow. Thanks for your request!</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth nothing that I did this via text but Comet does have the ability to take input via speech. </p>\n<p>Giving the AI that much access to my personal email definitely made me uneasy at this point though I suppose in a few years time I&#8217;ll think nothing of doing stuff like that. But having an AI that can summarize a long video is pretty darned handy given how often I end up sitting through videos looking for 1 piece of info. For that if nothing else, Comet is a win for me so far.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/25/comet-perplexitys-ai-browser/">Comet, Perplexity&#8217;s AI Browser</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/25/comet-perplexitys-ai-browser/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2'}

I find it can be a really helpful tool a lot of the time, and a pretty fun toy to mess around with, too.</p>\n<p>This is all really new so I don&#8217;t have comprehensive thoughts. At first I was kind of unimpressed. There&#8217;s a Gemini icon in the top right of the browser window, but so what? I have a Copilot button in my Task Bar. But then I was working on a Codecademy course and needed a refresher on the difference between append and extend for lists, so I hit that Gemini icon and asked the AI to give me the skinnny.</p>\n<p>It did so, but it also referenced the page I was on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Codecademy page you are on provides an example of how extend() can simplify code. In the &#8220;Performance&#8221; section, it suggests using thread_sold_split.extend(thread.split(&#8216;&#038;&#8217;)) as a more concise way to split and add thread colors to a list, compared to a nested loop. This is a great example of how extend() can replace a for loop that appends elements one by one.</p>\n<p>For more information and examples, you can check out resources like the Python List extend() Method article from GeeksforGeeks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So at this point you&#8217;re either saying &#8220;Oh shit Google is tracking every page I&#8217;m looking at!&#8221; or you&#8217;re saying &#8220;Whoa, that&#8217;s hella cool!&#8221; Or maybe both of those things. I said both but overall the cool aspect won out. </p>\n<p>To give this another test I opened the PDF of a lease agreement I happened to have on my machine, and asked for a summary. It read the PDF and gave me a nice table of all the pertinent info. Of course you can do the same with Chat GPT or any AI by just uploading a PDF, but if instead of a PDF this had been a long and complex post on the web, I&#8217;m assuming Gemini could&#8217;ve done the same thing. That seems like something that can be pretty useful.</p>\n<p>Also, unrelated to AI and I don&#8217;t know how new this is, but Chrome now handles multiple profiles really nicely. I have two Google accounts and by using Profiles I can keep them nicely separated (not sure how true that is for tracking purposes) with different extensions and such on each. There&#8217;s also a Guest profile which seems like Incognito on steroids. I&#8217;ve been using that for testing sites for work.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think I&#8217;m back to being a Chrome user now.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of my poor Python performance review and Gemini referencing the page.

Submodule 1 was pretty basic until I got to List Comprehension which was a brand new concept for me.</p>\n<p>List Comprehensions, as far as I can tell, don&#8217;t offer anything that you can&#8217;t accomplish in a For loops but they&#8217;re supposed to be easier to read (possibly true if you&#8217;re familiar with them) and faster due to how Python is tuned (I&#8217;ll take that bit on faith).</p>\n<p>What I find weird is that the syntax changes depending on conditional</p>\n<p>So if you have a list:</p>\n<p><code>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code></p>\n<p>and you want to use List Comprehension to create a sub-list of all numbers over 4 you would do something like:</p>\n<p><code>over_4 = [ num for num in numbers <span style="color: #ff0000;">if num &gt; 4</span> ]</code></p>\n<p>But if you wanted a list of the odd numbers and the square of the even numbers you&#8217;d have to re-arrange things:</p>\n<p><code>odds_and_square_evens = [num <span style="color: #ff0000;">if num % 2 else num**2</span> for num in numbers]</code></p>\n<p>See how the conditional changes spots depending on if it has an else clause? Weird.</p>\n<p>For me, right now, that&#8217;s not easier to read than a traditional 4 loop but maybe I&#8217;ll get there eventually.</p>\n<h2>So Far, So Good</h2>\n<p>Have to say that writing these posts has so far been a good motivator for me and I&#8217;ve done more at CodeCademy in the past few days than I&#8217;ve done in the past few months.</p>\n<p>Today, for example, I had not finished the 2nd module and thought I was done for the day, but then wanted to make the Internet proud so went back and did more to finish it up. We&#8217;ll see how long that kind of motivation lasts but for now I&#8217;ll take it!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/22/learning-journey-day-3/">Learning Journey, Day 3</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/22/learning-journey-day-3/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

For example, to get the length of list my_list you do len(&#8220;my_list&#8221;) whereas I&#8217;m used to doing my_list.length.

I didn&#8217;t learn very much, but I suppose typing up the solutions was a good way to build muscle memory around Python&#8217;s syntax. (In case you&#8217;ve never done ANYTHING with Python, the weird aspect &#8212; to me anyway &#8212; is that indentation matters. Python uses indents instead of curly braces to encapsulate code chunks like the body of an IF statement).</p>\n<p>The next module was on Lists which to my layman&#8217;s eyes are arrays with a different name. I jumped in and did 3 of the 8 sub-modules, but I noticed I was starting to feel a growing sense of annoyance which is EXACTLY the sense of annoyance I get in my real job when I have to do trivial and boring work. I took that as a sign to quit for the day.</p>\n<p>But yeah, still firmly in &#8220;how to program&#8221; territory with explanations of what bugs are, what looping is, conditional and logical operators and stuff like that. Important things to learn if you are brand new to programming, but info that is the same in all languages so isn&#8217;t new to me. But this was to be expected.</p>\n<h2>Life&#8217;s Challenges</h2>\n<p>One of my biggest challenges in learning programming, or learning anything that requires thinking and concentration, is fatigue.</p>\n<p>I am a terrible sleeper. My brain is never more awake and alert than it is as soon as my head hits the pillow. To combat this I have been relying on sleep gummies that have a mix of THC and CBD, and too often, a strong drink or two before I go to bed. That combo gets me to sleep but it doesn&#8217;t feel like restful sleep. I think the nights where I have a couple of drinks are the nights my sleep is particularly unrestful.</p>\n<p>My partner is a night owl, too, and she doesn&#8217;t have a set schedule for her work. She often lounges in bed until 10 am or so. When I go to bed at night, she&#8217;s wide awake and chatty. That doesn&#8217;t help either!</p>\n<p>When I try going to bed earlier, she just wakes me up when she comes to bed, after which I&#8217;m wide awake and can&#8217;t sleep. When things get REALLY bad I sleep downstairs on the couch so I can turn the light off at 11 or something. But that&#8217;s not great either, both for domestic tranquility reasons and because I wake up with a crick in my neck from sleeping scrunched up on the couch.</p>\n<p>The end result is I generally get about 5-6 hours of crummy sleep every night and I am CONSTANTLY tired if my brain is not stimulated. Don&#8217;t tell my boss this but some days I&#8217;ll stop work and play an arcade video game for 15 minutes or so and that will rouse my brain better than another cup of coffee does.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a solution for this issue. Cutting down on the alcohol before bed should help the issue, but won&#8217;t solve it. Hoping once I get deeper into the learning phase of this project I&#8217;ll have fewer issues. When I&#8217;m engaged with something that requires me to think, I don&#8217;t have the same issues with fatigue. Quite the contrary&#8230;when I&#8217;m working on something I&#8217;m REALLY interested in I get totally wired and&#8230; you guessed it, wind up staying up too late. It&#8217;s a vicious cycle!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/19/first-day-of-school/">First Day Of School</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/19/first-day-of-school/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

I&#8217;m barely out the door and I am already at a fork on the road.</p>\n<h2>CodeCademy</h2>\n<p>On the one hand, last November during Black Friday I bought a year&#8217;s subscription to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a> and then mostly left it to rot between then and now. They have courses for both Javascript and Python. I did the introductory Javascript course (and I&#8217;m almost ashamed to admit I learned a few things from it!) but it took me a LONG time to get through because I get bored really quickly. I started their intro to Python course and the same thing.</p>\n<p>The problem for someone like me is that the Intro courses have to teach you not just the syntax of the language you&#8217;re learning but the fundamentals of programming as well. This means you get lots of &#8220;What is a Variable?&#8221; level instruction. I wish they had an &#8220;I know this material&#8221; checkbox you could click to quickly skip through that stuff, but instead you have to type out these super trivial (to anyone who has written code before) assignments in order to &#8216;pass&#8217; and move forward.</p>\n<p>I probably could just skip the Intro courses but I&#8217;m a little OCD and always feel driven to start at the beginning and go through all the steps. Yeah, in this series of posts you&#8217;re going to learn a lot about how weird my brain is.</p>\n<h2>A Free Online Book</h2>\n<p>My coach Marissa suggested another page. She suggested a free online book, <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automate the Boring Stuff With Python</a>, which is a book I&#8217;ve heard of but had forgotten about. Her reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not flashy. Not AI.</li>\n<li>But it teaches you to\xa0<em>think in Python</em>.</li>\n<li>You’ll learn loops, functions, file handling, web scraping—<em>fast</em>.</li>\n<li>Do the projects.</li>\n<li>Then burn it like a bridge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Which Path?</h2>\n<p>So those are the choices I&#8217;m considering. On the one hand, I paid for CodeCademy so it seems crazy not to use it. But damn does it put me to sleep for now. If I can push through I figure I&#8217;ll get to more challenging stuff. And CodeCademy has some gamification in there with levels to earn and streaks and stuff and I&#8217;m sort of a sucker for those.</p>\n<p>The book no doubt would teach me faster but I&#8217;d be more reliant on will-power to stick with it. But it might get me to where I can start noodling with my own projects a lot faster.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s actually a 3rd option: I also bought a subscription to <a href="https://brilliant.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brilliant</a> last November. It also has Python courses but Brilliant feels more like a game or something to pass the time while waking up your brain than it does a serious learning tool. Mind you my streak is at like 280 days of doing Brilliant but a lot of that was math and stuff, which was an interesting experience because it dredged up knowledge from High School. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the tool for me for learning a programming language.</p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;m going to try to push through the early levels of CodeCademy while I still have the sub, but probably won&#8217;t renew it. I just realized November is right around the corner. Once it expires I can move on to the book. I should be able to blast through it by then.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/19/the-path-less-taken-maybe/">The Path Less Taken&#8230; Maybe</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/19/the-path-less-taken-maybe/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

The game appears (and plays) like an aquatic combination of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/18/coffee-talk-review/">Coffee Talk</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/15/steamworld-dig-2-review/">SteamWorld Dig</a></em>, which are both games I very much enjoy. I downloaded <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> upon release on Switch, but it fell into my backlog until this year; in recent months, I&#8217;ve gotten around to properly playing through the game, and I&#8217;m glad I did so &#8211; not only does it deliver on the rewarding gameplay loop and sumptuous pixel art graphics I hoped for, but it&#8217;s been an ideal showcase for chilled handheld gaming on the Nintendo Switch 2!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting the review, I&#8217;d like to mention the brief controversy around <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, as I remember it adding unfair caution to my approach to the game. Back in 2023, the game was nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards, which drew criticism because the game wasn&#8217;t an Indie game &#8211; the developer MINTROCKET was a subsidiary of Nexon, a lucrative South Korean company. The developers were not responsible for the game being nominated, and it appears that the nomination was based off of the pixel art graphics and relaxed alternative vibe of the game, instead of the literal definition of an independent company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, the CEO of MINTROCKET &#8211; and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> creator &#8211; Jaeho Hwang said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>“I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like a more detailed explanation and opinion, I highly recommend <a href="https://indiecator.org/2023/11/15/why-is-dave-the-diver-not-indie/">this post on <em>Indiecator</em> by MagiWasTaken</a>, which discusses the situation in better detail than I could in this short review introduction. Ironically, it&#8217;s since been announced in 2024 that MINTROCKET is becoming independent (albeit with support from Nexon to carry out the move). My main point is that this controversy is not something to think ill of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> or MINTROCKET for, and that allowed me to dive into the game fresh. Right, that&#8217;s enough preamble, so let&#8217;s get into the review!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Catch of the Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> follows the story of Dave and his friends, who&#8217;ve travelled to the oceanic Blue Hole to set up a sushi restaurant called Bancho Sushi (named after the head chef Bancho). As the title suggests, Dave must dive underwater to collect the fish and ingredients, and this forms the majority of the game &#8211; you must balance risk and reward as you collect as much as Dave can carry, whilst keeping track of your oxygen levels and means to get back to the surface &#8211; either by swimming back up, or finding an Escape Pod point. If you run out of oxygen and get stranded underwater, you lose all but one of your collected items, which severely impacts the success of the sushi restaurant in the evenings. This risk/reward system is reminiscent of the digging in <em>SteamWorld Dig</em>, and is implemented superbly here &#8211; the player has to make the tough decision between keeping what they&#8217;ve got, or risking pushing a little further and potentially losing it all. It&#8217;s a brilliant gameplay loop that keeps you coming back for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15160" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15140" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15139" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The game eases you in gently, starting with introducing the mechanics of catching fish at a relatively shallow depth. Your main weapon is the harpoon, which can be fired in front of you to reel in fish. However, there&#8217;s a delay whilst the fish struggles, which gives other dangerous creatures the time to close in on Dave &#8211; and later on, the harpoon requires multiple hits and/or extra button combinations to capture stronger fish. There are also various items to discover and collect, either as supplementary ingredients found in submerged cooking pots, or as materials scattered on the sea floor. Dave only has a certain amount they can hold at once, which quickly becomes reason to earn the Gold needed for upgrading your Cargo Box storage limit &#8211; as well as your Air Tank, Harpoon Gun, and more. In turn, this motivates the player for the sushi segments of the game; depending on how well the restaurant performs in the evenings, the more Gold you&#8217;ll earn for upgrades. Both sides of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> continue to ingeniously compliment each other in this way, as success in one helps you in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the sushi segments are rather different from the diving, and this is where my earlier comparison to <em>Coffee Talk</em> comes in. After setting sail to Bancho Sushi, you start by going through a list of your possible dishes to serve in your evening menu; your selection is based upon the fish you&#8217;ve caught and the ingredients you&#8217;ve acquired. The quality and quantity of your haul determines your success, as rarer fish open up more expensive dishes that result in a more lucrative evening. Upon selecting each dish, you can also enhance it if you have enough excess ingredients &#8211; a process given extra visual flair by the wonderful animated cutscenes of Bancho preparing the food. These animations aren&#8217;t limited to just Bancho, and are sprinkled throughout <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, such as when weapons expert Duff upgrades your guns. Each of these sequences has a tongue-in-cheek over-exaggerated tone, and add to the playful charm of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15133" height="360" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif?w=640" width="640" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in Bancho Sushi you can browse and sell your ingredients for quickfire Gold, as well as decorate the restaurant as you see fit, and even hire extra members of staff to help you out. The latter are essential, as over time the restaurant gets busier; once you open the restaurant, you control Dave as he serves dishes and maintains the restaurant, and hiring extra hands to help is key to success. Whether it&#8217;s pouring drinks, dashing around to serve sushi plates, cleaning up, or keeping Bancho well-stocked with sushi, this is a frenetic <em>Overcooked</em>-style part of the game that contrasts well with the diving. It&#8217;s certainly not as layered as the underwater gameplay, but it&#8217;s not supposed to be, and does a successful job at giving the player a break between each dive. Plus, it&#8217;s extremely satisfying to see the profits come in &#8211; which can then be spent on upgrades the next day, when the cycle begins anew&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Just Keep Swimming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this core gameplay loop, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> steadily introduces new characters and locations throughout the seven main story chapters. They&#8217;re an eclectic bunch, each with their own expertise and side quests. Archaeologist Dr. Bacon propels the main story forward; as you dive deeper, you discover much more than just fish, including secret civilizations and bigger ecological threats to the Blue Hole &#8211; the latter of which is tracked by the biologist Ellie, who gives you various collection tasks through the Ecowatcher app. Speaking of which, your progress is mostly tracked via these apps, which are accessed via the efficient menu on Dave&#8217;s smartphone. To give a few examples: you might use the phone to acquire and upgrade weapons (with the help of the aforementioned Duff); you might browse your snaps for photographer Udo; or you might look through your Pokémon-style Marinca collection for Sato, an Ash Ketchum lookalike!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15146" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15153" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15154" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between all these characters and side quests, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> has something for everyone. If you like collecting then you can focus on filling out the Marinca (essentially a Pokédex for fish), if you like the sushi-management side you can focus on optimising your earnings, and if you like exploring then you can focus on the diving. Whichever way you play, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> smartly manages to naturally push the story on regardless &#8211; for example, a character named Otto opens a farm partway into the game, where you can grow crops such as rice. Growing these ingredients helps you to reliably create more valuable dishes in the evening; but to help out Otto and subsequently build up the farm, you need to collect certain items, which requires becoming proficient at the diving. Each element of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> gently motivates the others in this way, and therefore pushes the player to test out every facet of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a side effect of this admirable gameplay variety is that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> occasionally inserts under-baked minigames or quick time events. One instance of this is the cooking competition side missions, where you must gather ingredients for Bancho as you normally would, but upon doing so, you must then engage in first-person cooking challenges. These consist of basic button presses and directional inputs, and feel like a rushed version of either a <em>Cooking Mama</em> or <em>Mario Party</em> minigame. It was the rare moment in <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> where I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15123" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15124" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15127" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15136" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, some of these asides work better than others &#8211; a relatively quick soldering minigame is an enjoyable and brief inclusion, and there&#8217;s a compelling <em>Balatro</em>-style card game, but on the other hand, a one-time stealth sequence is particularly badly designed. These hiccups are rare enough that they don&#8217;t significantly detract from <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, but they were also noticeable enough that I had to mention them in this review. They just feel unnecessary &#8211; it&#8217;s as if <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> felt it had to extend itself beyond the main gameplay loop that it executes so superbly. If anything, the high quality of the core diving-and-sushi-selling gameplay only make the brief diversions more jarring.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Deadly Depths</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the various other side missions and gameplay mechanics, it&#8217;s the diving that&#8217;s understandably the focus of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, and it&#8217;s exceptionally well-balanced. As aforementioned, your initial harpoon is a unique weapon to master &#8211; but Dave can also carry one firearm, either by collecting them underwater or by crafting them beforehand. There&#8217;s a range of weapon types: you might use the Net Gun for catching large swathes of fish, or perhaps the Grenade Launcher for explosive damage, or even (my weapon of choice) the Sniper Rifle for long-range damage. The latter is especially handy when tackling sea life that is aggressive at close range, such as the many sharks patrolling the Blue Hole!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15161" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Dave isn&#8217;t just reeling in small fish. You&#8217;ll soon be fighting not only sharks, but hostile jellyfish, giant squids, and plenty more! Significant story events are often accompanied by a boss fight against a dangerous opponent such as these, introduced with stylish freeze frames reminiscent of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and signifying the stakes of the encounter. Additionally, new areas of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> can be a trial by fire, with enemies that suddenly reduce huge amounts of your oxygen supply (which doubles as a health bar of sorts) with a single hit. However, the challenge rarely felt unfair, and any failed dives were always down to my own mistakes &#8211; and only left me more motivated to improve my aquatic skills or upgrade my gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, as well as your harpoon and firearm, Dave can carry a melee weapon (also used for mining materials) and two pieces of equipment. The latter of these can vary, from battle items such as a proximity mine, to ways of helping Dave in a pinch, such as portable oxygen refills. Most of these can be found underwater, or alternatively, they can be pre-purchased from Cobra in the boat before starting your dive, adding another way for the player to customise their approach. Overall, there&#8217;s a well-judged balance between giving the player plenty of options, but not giving you so much power that you can become complacent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15142" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15172" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15168" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when you feel comfortable with Dave and his toolset, the missions being asked of you often cleverly push you out of your comfort zone &#8211; and if you&#8217;re not careful, it doesn&#8217;t take much for a dangerous enemy or perilous area to derail your dive and leave you back at the boat almost empty-handed. It&#8217;s oh-so-easy to fall into the trap of completing just one more mission, collecting just one more item, capturing just one more fish &#8211; but equally, there&#8217;s an undeniable thrill to escaping just in time. In the later chapters, missions become more specific to match your increased skills, and particular ingredients can necessitate repeated captures of rare creatures. This cycle reminded me of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and similarly to that series, provides a tangible reason to keep capturing the most elusive fish &#8211; in this case, to find the rarest ingredients and compose the finest dishes at Bancho Sushi!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Under the Sea</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the endearing yet adventurous nature of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the graphical style; the gorgeous pixel-art invites you in, making diving a little deeper &#8211; and playing a little longer &#8211; even more enticing. The shallow regions are full of bright welcoming colours, but the variety only builds from here. Every layer under the water has a unique visual identity, such as the dark Blue Hole Depths, or the extreme cold and heat of later areas. Meanwhile, night-time dives feature a shining kaleidoscope of colourful foliage that feels magical to navigate &#8211; when you&#8217;re not being pursued by deadly fish, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15162" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the human character designs have a palpable sense of personality. This gets more spotlight in the earlier-mentioned animated cutscenes, which blend the stunning pixel art with the tongue-in-cheek humour that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> does so well. By the end of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, the roster of characters have a real sense of camaraderie between them, which contributes to that overall warm and relaxed feeling that the game has. Add in the detailed multitude of marine species and food recipes, and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> really is a delectably beautiful game. Playing it on the large handheld screen <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/09/09/did-my-hopes-for-the-switch-2-become-a-reality/">of the Switch 2</a> has only accentuated this feeling further for me &#8211; and it&#8217;s been a great example for how that console helps the back catalogue of the original Switch to shine even brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial compliment to the visuals of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the music, which is often a wonderfully soothing backdrop to your deep sea exploration. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a notably therapeutic game when you’re just casually collecting fish, exploring the vast swathes of water, and listening to the delicate musical backdrop. My favourite piece of music is for a late-game frozen area, where these tranquil tones morph into a synth-style inspirational beat. Also, music fans will get an extra treat from a certain cameo appearance at Bancho Sushi, who comes complete with a musical performance that I’ve been listening to many times since! Not to be glossed over is the sound design, too &#8211; the sounds of marine life, the tense pull of a harpoon, the whooshing of waves, it all sounds authentic and distinct, and pulls you further into the watery world of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15163" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15148" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg?w=863" width="863" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15150" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing about this game &#8211; it reels you in, not necessarily in a sudden way, but a gradual one. As the in-game days go by, you settle more thoroughly into the gameplay loop, getting more familiar with characters old and new, until they become familiar friends on your adventure. There&#8217;s a sense of pleasing routine to checking your farms for crops and ingredients, then going diving and completing missions, before then preparing for the evening Bancho Sushi business. It&#8217;s a lot like the charm of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> or <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but with the added element of gripping underwater gameplay to go alongside it. The game is kept fresh by the steady incline of options and equipment available to Dave, and this creates an endgame with potentially endless longevity. Even when you finish all of the main story missions, you still have a restaurant business to run, and you can continue building it out to your hearts content. There&#8217;s extra DLC too, two of which (the <em>Dredge</em> and <em>Godzilla</em> tie-in packs) are free, for those looking for extra content!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a delight to play through <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. The mix of gripping gameplay and relaxing sushi simulation &#8211; combined with the incredible art direction and music &#8211; makes for an RPG full of endearing charm and well-meaning adventure. At its heart is whimsy and a sense of positivity, and that soaks through into every part of the game &#8211; and each part compliments the other in a wonderfully natural way. My only criticism is that this enthusiasm leads to the introduction of impromptu minigames and quick time events that sometimes feel underdeveloped in contrast to the main diving gameplay &#8211; but they&#8217;re few and far between, and a drop in the ocean compared to the sea of brilliance within <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. There&#8217;s brilliant longevity built in too &#8211; even after finishing the main story, the diving and sushi restaurant aspects remain, for those who&#8217;d like to continue building Bancho Sushi into the best restaurant it can be. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a treasure of a game, and it comes highly recommended from me!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center

This particular Direct was split into three distinct segments: first about the 40th Anniversary of Mario, then news for the original Nintendo Switch, and then finally information on the Switch 2 &#8211; and altogether it made for a barnstorming hour-long performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo has been on a run of brilliant Directs over the last few years, but this might genuinely be my favourite one for a long while. Many of the announcements in this Direct speak specifically to me and the games I have been looking forward to, and it&#8217;s genuinely made whittling my choices down to five a tough task! If you&#8217;d like to see the full Nintendo Direct, you can do so below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Honourable Mentions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of it being a tough task&#8230; With so much packed into the Direct, I am first going to run through some other announcements that I was glad or intrigued to see, but didn&#8217;t make the cut for the five announcements that appealed most to me personally. The Nintendo Direct started with several <em>Mario </em>announcements in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary: this included a trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> in 2026, as well as a collection of both <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> games for Nintendo Switch, coming October 2nd this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retrospectively, this does make <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/04/lets-chat-3d-mario-games-are-coming-to-switch-but-where-is-galaxy-2/">the decision not to include <em>Galaxy 2</em> in the <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> collection</a> feel very calculated. I personally will likely pass on this new release of the <em>Galaxy </em>games, as the £58.99 cost (or £33.99 separately) feels excessive &#8211; and whilst they are superb games, I doubt I&#8217;ll play them enough when there are so many other new games to play. I do, however, hope to get the physical <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOor7cl-qF_B_yaH1ketH1_ep2UqAIeMsULytGxbXaJ-8c79YpmKe">Rosalina&#8217;s Storybook</a> they are making, as that would be lovely to keep in the collection!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15028" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15029" height="377" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg?w=670" width="670" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15027" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15026" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we got a release date of 4th December for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was great to have confirmed &#8211; and the only reason it isn&#8217;t in my main five picks below is that the new footage left me a bit hesitant. We got to see the new bike Samus will use to traverse the world, and there was something off about it &#8211; the world looked a bit too empty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The footage reminded me of the infamous Mako in the first <em>Mass Effect</em> game, which was also known for wide open spaces that felt empty and were awkward to navigate. Visually, the bike is very cool, and the first-person segments look fantastic, but I was surprised at the briefness of this new footage. I sincerely hope that isn&#8217;t a sign of a lack of confidence in the game; either way, eight years after the initial announcement, I remain very excited for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> to finally launch!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I&#8217;d like to give a mention to the <em>Pokémon</em> segment of the Direct. We got the announcement of a brand new spin-off game named <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, which looks like a mix between<em> Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>, where you play as a Ditto-turned-human (whether this is charming or horrific, you decide)! This game probably won&#8217;t be for me, but I envisage it being very popular, by blending life-sim mechanics with the popularity of the world of <em>Pokémon</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, we got more info for the soon-to-be-released <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, showing off new Mega Evolutions; this segment ended with an announcement of the upcoming <em>Mega Dimension</em> paid DLC, and this felt quite cynical &#8211; it feels strange to have paid DLC announced before we even have the base game. I&#8217;ll wait and see how that DLC materialises, but for now, I&#8217;m fine not seeing much more about <em>Z-A</em>, as I&#8217;m definitely purchasing the game at launch. From here, the Direct transitioned into the surprise announcement of <em>Danganronpa 2&#215;2</em>, a new version of <em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> with added content! I only relatively recently finished (<a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/09/danganronpa-2-goodbye-despair-review-an-ambitious-beautiful-mess-of-a-sequel/">and reviewed</a>) the original game on Switch, and I really enjoyed it overall, so I&#8217;ll be curious to see how much difference the additions make.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15020" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15024" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15025" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15022" height="338" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg?w=600" width="600" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That was quite a long honourable mentions section, wasn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a result of just how many exciting announcements we received; I finished this Direct feeling very optimistic about the future of the Switch 2, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten into my top five reason why! When there are so many announcements, writing this sort of article helps me process the Direct and focus in on the games I&#8217;m going to prioritise playing, and I hope it is an enjoyable read for you too! Right, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#5: Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the most exciting part of the <em>Mario </em>section of the Direct was the announcement of a brand new Yoshi game, named <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em>! Yoshi side-scrollers have a reputation for charming art directions &#8211; for example <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Woolly World</em> and <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Crafted World</em> &#8211; and this game continues that, with a gorgeous stop-motion visual style bursting with colour and personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot of the game follows Yoshi after the appearance of a peculiar book named Mr. E, with pages detailing mysterious creatures. Yoshi jumps into the book (which is the reason for the storybook graphical style) and meets various new creatures, with the details jotted down into the book as Yoshi does so. Completing the storybook of fantastical creatures is an accompaniment to the charming platforming, and there&#8217;s a palpable sense of warmth and whimsy to it all. This game looks ideal for playing on a rainy weekend, wrapped up warm and enjoying the cosy gameplay. I see <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>being a brilliant experience for all ages of players, and I look forward to playing it myself when it releases in Spring 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#4: Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Direct contained the announcements of release dates for several high-profile previously-announced games, and three of these appear on my list. Starting this off is <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>, the third <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> game after the original and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/05/15/my-to-play-list-may-2023-progress/">Age of Calamity</a></em>, which is confirmed to release on November 6th. Just as the latter of those filled in story gaps for <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, one of the main appeals of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is adding story details for <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. Specifically, the time period that Princess Zelda is sent back to in that game &#8211; and I&#8217;m glad to see this time covered more thoroughly, as it felt to me that Zelda was unfairly side-lined in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as a release date, the new footage showed off playable characters such as Queen Sonia, King Rauru, and a new unnamed Korok character. The gameplay looks like the expected <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-esque combat, but there are some additions, such as Zonai devices and multi-character Sync Strikes that change depending on the character combinations. There&#8217;s also the confirmation of local GameShare multiplayer and splitscreen, and glimpses of many epic visual sequences such as airborne Gleeok battles. I accept that the gameplay will likely be repetitive, but for me the appeal of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games is the visual spectacle and extra lore &#8211; and<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> looks to be delivering on that!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#3: Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the brand new announcements of the Direct was that of a new mainline <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, named <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em>. It&#8217;s been wonderful to see <em>Fire Emblem</em> gradually become a household name in the West, with the 3DS games such as <em>Awakening</em> laying the groundwork for <em>Three Houses</em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/14/a-little-zelda-a-lotta-farming-takeaways-from-the-nintendo-direct/">Engage</a> </em>to be massive hits on Switch. The distinction setting <em>Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart is the gladiator-style Heroic Games, which has a multitude of characters competing for the fulfilled wishes that supposedly reward your victory. At the end of the trailer, we see a tease of Sothis, a character from Three Houses &#8211; so it appears there may be a story connection to that game as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the game looks stunning, with gorgeous anime visuals, and clean turn-based strategy UI design. Part of the appeal of <em>Fire Emblem</em> is the stakes of building character relationships in a world where permadeath is possible, and the gladiatorial setting will hopefully provide a fresh twist to that structure that will set<em> Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart. The trailer has a variety of striking characters, and I&#8217;m looking forward to finding my favourites! For now, we only have a general 2026 release date, so I&#8217;d guess that this game will be one of the major late-year releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#2: Resident Evil: Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think it surprising that I&#8217;ve put two already-announced games above the news of a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game; but that&#8217;s a reflection of my adoration for the franchises these next two games are a part of, and how stoked I am to see additional news about their next instalments. Firstly we have <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, the much-anticipated ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> game (if you don&#8217;t count <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/27/resident-evil-zero-review/"><em>Resident Evil Zero</em></a>). This latest entry stars FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she pursues the truth about a deadly virus and the mystery of her mother&#8217;s death &#8211; a path which leads her to the ruins of Raccoon City. This game had already been announced for other consoles, but this is the formal announcement of a Switch 2 version, which is brilliant to see. On Switch, <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/11/25/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/16/resident-evil-village-review/">Resident Evil Village</a></em> could only be played as Cloud games, but the more conventional release of <em>Requiem </em>shows that the console can (for now, at least) keep up with modern large-scale third-party releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually might play <em>Requiem </em>on Switch 2 &#8211; my only other means would be PC or Xbox Series S, and as someone who likes to collect physical copies of <em>Resident Evil</em> games on console, that makes the Switch 2 version more appealing to me. <em>Requiem </em>is up there as one of my most anticipated games; I adore the <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise, and am eagerly awaiting <em>Requiem</em> to see how they interweave the lore of the series into the story. Other than Chris Redfield, we haven&#8217;t had any of the earlier characters show up in the main series since <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, and with the return to Raccoon City, this feels like an ideal time for some guest appearances of older, more experienced versions of those fan favourites. Grace Ashcroft is also the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character from the lesser-known spin-off <em>Resident Evil Outbreak</em> games, which already shows that Capcom is happy playing with some deep-cut lore. I happen to have bought the two <em>Outbreak</em> games second-hand before <em>Requiem</em> was even announced, and am planning to play them before the launch of <em>Requiem </em>and write up my thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Requiem </em>trailer in the Direct was full of intense visuals, threatening figures, and story hints (such as the iconic Umbrella Corporation logo). It struck me that there&#8217;s an underlying grungy tone waiting to break out, which I&#8217;m very excited to discover. This can even be seen in the logo for <em>Requiem</em>, and the burned-out profile shot of Grace near the end of this new trailer. Right now, the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise is in a very healthy place (as healthy a a series about viral monstrosities can be, anyway), and it&#8217;s given Capcom a resulting confidence that could make this game utterly exceptional. They&#8217;re playing their cards close to their chest, concealing the full extent of the horrors that await us on February 27th&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#1: Hades II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yes, oh yes. This is an announcement fans of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/14/hades-review/">Hades</a></em> and Supergiant Games have been awaiting since the reveal of <em>Hades II</em> back at The Game Awards in 2022, and now it&#8217;s here &#8211; the release date of the official 1.0 version, releasing digitally on Switch and PC on September 25th (and physically on November 20th). The first <em>Hades</em> is a phenomenal roguelike action game that turned many players into fans of the genre, but it was quite a surprise when Supergiant announced a sequel &#8211; not only was the first game utterly jam-packed with content and ideas, but they&#8217;d never done a sequel game before. I&#8217;ve purposefully been avoiding details about the game in Early Access, as I&#8217;d like to go in fresh and see what marvels Supergiant have cooked up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon this could be a <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>/<em>Galaxy 2</em> situation, where the developers have so many ideas and so much creativity to share, that they need a whole other game to fit it all in. This time, we play as the immortal Princess of the Underworld, battling against the Titan of Time and exploring an even larger and deeper mythic world of Olympian Gods. In the Direct, this was visualized with a cutscene that gave me goosebumps from the visual flair on show; Supergiant are known for their sumptuous visuals and music, and that&#8217;s very much still the case here. I&#8217;m eager to dive back into the rich gameplay and gripping story of the world of <em>Hades</em>, reuniting with previous characters (Artemis is back!) and meeting new ones. I honestly didn&#8217;t expect the release date to be so soon, but in less than two weeks we&#8217;ll be able to play the 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> &#8211; discovering new Boons, enemies, locations, and more. Bring it on!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>This Nintendo Direct was sensational, and answered many questions about release dates and upcoming games for the Switch 2 (and Switch) release slate. I&#8217;ve been enjoying my gaming a lot recently, and this Direct has only fuelled that passion more &#8211; the only problem is going to be finding the time to play all these games!

It&#8217;s been roughly a year and a half since I wrote that post, and the Switch 2 has been out for just over three months &#8211; so we now have comprehensive knowledge of what the system offers. With the Switch 2, Nintendo took the wise (and safe) approach, capitalising on the continued popularity of the Switch brand and not changing things too drastically. The console is more of an iteration rather than a revolution, but it certainly makes significant changes and upgrades in certain areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had some time with the Switch 2, I thought it&#8217;d be a suitable moment to take a look back at my aforementioned post about my hopes for the console, run one-by-one through the list, and talk about which became a reality (and which didn&#8217;t). Then, at the end of the post, I&#8217;ll summarise my current personal opinions on the Switch 2, taking these results into account. Right then, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Optimize the eShop: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My foremost request was to improve the eShop, which was struggling on multiple fronts on the original Switch: the sheer volume of releases made discoverability of games difficult; there was a lack of quality control; and the user interface was susceptible to noticeable lag. In my opinion, this was one of the most important areas for Nintendo to improve upon &#8211; it might seem less flashy than other aspects, but improving the process of finding new digital games is an underrated key aspect of a modern console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To start on a positive note, I&#8217;m pleased with the way Nintendo has improved the responsiveness of the eShop. I immediately noticed how much quicker and easier it is to navigate the store &#8211; gone are the painful moments waiting for the eShop to catch up with your inputs. Whether this is down to the increased hardware power, general eShop optimisation, or both, it improves the experience of browsing through the available games, and encourages curiosity as a result. In my book, that boost to game discoverability is a win for both the player and the developers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, whilst Nintendo has bolstered the options on the eShop main menu, it&#8217;s not as extensively as I&#8217;d hoped. Most of the options &#8211; such as the Search, Current Offers, and Coming Soon &#8211; are the same, and the only brand new addition is the For You tab, which recommends games based on your own gameplay trends. I was really hoping for some other additions, or even a review system so that players could help to recommend games for others. As it is, the eShop still has the problem of a constant inundation of new games &#8211; and whilst the Popular New Releases sub-section is a step in the right direction, any game that doesn&#8217;t qualify for this (or the Highlights tab) will get very limited time to grab player attention before the spotlight is taken by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14942" height="645" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14940" height="639" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14938" height="624" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14941" height="598" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of quality control, I reserve full judgement until more time has passed, but it seems that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t changed their approach. Lots of cheap-looking games are still flooding the eShop, and there are still Hentai games appearing relatively frequently. From my perspective, Nintendo could still do with raising the bar of entry, in order to curate a higher level of overall quality across the eShop. The current influx of these low-quality games worsens the issue of discoverability for other titles, which get mired amidst them despite taking much more time and effort to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the steps I&#8217;d still like to see taken for more eShop filtering options and better quality control, Nintendo has still significantly improved the eShop, especially in terms of responsiveness. Therefore, I mark this section as a success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More Power: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is that age-old request for new consoles &#8211; that they have more power, and are able to present games in higher framerates and resolutions. Since the Wii/DS era, Nintendo has rarely (if ever) been known as the technical powerhouse, with art direction, creative hardware, and recognizable IP being more important for bringing in players. That said, the Switch 2 is a big step up from the original Switch, with Nvidia claiming that it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nvidia-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">&#8220;10 times the graphical performance&#8221;</a> of the previous console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a technical expert, so I look for comparisons to other consoles to get a handle on where the Switch 2 lands power-wise. The general perception seems to be that at peak performance, docked on a TV, the Switch 2 is comparable to a PlayStation 4 Pro, but still behind the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles &#8211; which essentially matches my prediction back in March 2024. When played in handheld mode, the system is closer to a base PlayStation 4, but that is compensated for by the smaller screen, which often makes games look crisper to the eye (at least for me).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a hybrid system with a handheld option, battery life is another crucial factor to consider, and the increased performance does appear to have hurt the Switch 2 in this area. You generally get around two-three hours when playing any sort of intensive game, which can feel quite short. However, most of the time I don&#8217;t see this being an issue, unless I am on a very long journey &#8211; and it&#8217;s rare not to have a nearby place to plug in and charge. Whilst that isn&#8217;t an excuse, I prefer Nintendo providing stronger hardware and a shorter battery life rather than the opposite, so I&#8217;m still satisfied on this front. For example, I&#8217;m playing <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/09/17/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-14-09-23/">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em> at the moment, and occasionally having to charge the console is a small price to pay for how well it plays and looks in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14949" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14946" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14947" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14948" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When playing in handheld mode, the screen really is stunning; the increased size and power makes games look incredible, and it makes playing in bed (or wherever you prefer) feel like a luxury. The vibrancy and sharpness of the screen &#8211; especially when held close up for handheld gaming &#8211; gave me that new-generation-upgrade feeling that I was looking for. I&#8217;ve heard some disappointment that Nintendo didn&#8217;t use an OLED screen, but in my opinion the LCD screen is more than sufficient, and if it helps keep costs down then that&#8217;s a reasonable trade. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll get an OLED version of the Switch 2 (like for the original Switch) at some point too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only Switch 2-exclusive game I&#8217;ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em> (you can <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/10/mario-kart-world-review-a-stunning-racer-that-misses-a-few-tricks/">read my review here</a>), and as well as being a fantastic game, it doubles as an excellent technical showcase for the Switch 2. Played in 4K HDR on my TV, it looks sensational. The game moves with a crisp fluidity, and the environment feels palpably full of detail and colour. It was upon playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> that it really dawned on me that the Switch 2 was a major &#8211; and timely &#8211; graphical update on its predecessor, allowing it to keep fair pace with the technical state of gaming.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14934" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>All that graphical performance is needed to do justice to the beauty of Cow</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>All in all, whilst my test case for the Switch 2 is relatively limited for now (I haven&#8217;t played upgraded Switch games like <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em> yet either), I&#8217;m confident that the Switch 2 has delivered on the level of power I personally need in a Nintendo console. I don&#8217;t need it to be top-of-the-range; as long as the system is powerful enough to realise the trademark visual flair of first-party Nintendo games, and is able to house a strong line-up of new third-party releases, then that&#8217;s plenty for me. I eagerly await seeing what Nintendo can magic up with their bespoke Switch 2 games in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Clarity on Games: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads nicely into my next point, on the topic of the Switch 2 software line-up now and into the future. A console is defined by the games on it &#8211; and there were two particular games I was waiting for news on when I wrote that original post in March 2024. These were <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> and also the next Nintendo EAD game, which I predicted would be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game in the vein of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. We have received news on both of these games, even if the latter wasn&#8217;t quite the game I expected, as it has instead materialised as <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14932" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I am loving the vibrant purples in this art, by the way</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about <em>Metroid</em>. The development path of the long-awaited <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> has been turbulent, to say the least &#8211; after being announced back in 2017, Nintendo then publicly announced that they were restarting development in 2019, with Retro Studios (the developers of the original <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em>) coming back on board. When I wrote my post about my hopes for the Switch 2, we were still awaiting news on Metroid &#8211; but roughly three months later <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/06/19/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-18-06-2024/">in the June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, Nintendo finally showed us an announcement trailer for the newly-titled <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That initial trailer gave us a taste of the returning first-person <em>Metroid</em> gameplay and a glimpse of returning enemy Sylux, which kept fans occupied until February 2025, when it was announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM&amp;t=1631s">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> that <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> would be a cross-generation title on both Switch and Switch 2. Whilst unsurprising, this was welcome news &#8211; and roughly a month later in March, we got another Nintendo Direct trailer (see below), showing off more of the game and giving us a 2025 release date. This was followed up by an extensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9xes7BZto">Nintendo Treehouse video</a> in April, continuing the steady stream of new information on the game. However, as we enter September, we&#8217;re awaiting news on a precise release date, and I hope we hear more soon. Even if the game has to be pushed into 2026, I wouldn&#8217;t mind &#8211; after so long waiting, I&#8217;d prefer to wait a little longer if it means a better experience. What&#8217;s another few months after eight years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be fascinating to see the comparison between the Switch 2 and Switch editions of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>; the enhanced Switch 2 edition will have Joy-Con 2 mouse controls as well as support for 4K, HDR, and 120 fps! After seeing how brilliant <em>Mario Kart World</em> looks, I&#8217;m excited to experience a new <em>Metroid</em> adventure in these formats &#8211; I have a feeling the game will look sensational. So far, it appears that the game isn&#8217;t straying too far from the gameplay of previous <em>Prime </em>games, and instead refining the first-person formula, with some added tricks such as Psychic Abilities for Samus. I&#8217;m especially intrigued to see where the story goes, and am avoiding too many plot details until release!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, I thought <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was the more outlandish of the two games I was anticipating back in March 2024, as I was confident that a new 3D <em>Mario </em>from Nintendo EAD would be announced. I was both right and wrong &#8211; whilst we haven&#8217;t received a 3D <em>Mario </em>per se, we have gotten a new <em>Mario</em>-adjacent Nintendo EAD 3D game, in the form of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! This was the closing reveal in the Switch 2 Direct back in April; but it wasn&#8217;t until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Direct</a> in June that it was announced this isn&#8217;t just a Donkey Kong game, but a Pauline game as well, with a younger version of the character joining DK on his travels!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo EAD have an amazing track record, and the glowing critical reception to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>has been a continuation of this, praising the sheer gameplay creativity and enjoyment. One of the key features is the ability for Donkey Kong to smash through the environment, reshaping and even creating tunnels through it! The game released on 17th July, and I haven&#8217;t actually played it yet, as I haven&#8217;t found the time to justify spending the money on it. But now <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/">that I&#8217;ve finished the Pokémon League in <em>Pokémon Diamond</em></a> and am taking a break from that, I&#8217;ll hopefully soon get around to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, my next definite Switch 2 purchase will be <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, and I&#8217;m very tempted to get <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> too! There&#8217;s also the question about how series such as <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/10/25/where-can-zelda-go-after-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> might manifest on Switch 2, but I&#8217;m happy having patience &#8211; there are already so many other amazing games to play in the meantime!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More System Customization: No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, here we come to the first of my hopes that didn&#8217;t become a reality. The original Switch only allowed very simple customisation of the Home screen, and Switch 2 hasn&#8217;t evolved this at all, still only allowing two Themes: Basic White and Basic Black (my console is set to the latter). Having a Themes menu suggests the idea of having more options, but I&#8217;m not full of confidence, as we haven&#8217;t received any extra options since the original Switch launch in 2017.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14926" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I like neutral colours, but the option to add more flair could be fun</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not a software developer, it feels like Nintendo is missing an open goal by not allowing us to have Themes based on franchises such as <em>Mario</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, or <em>Metroid</em> &#8211; I honestly think people would even spend a small amount on these, in order to add vibrant new visuals to their systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that Nintendo could still add options in the future, but it&#8217;s disappointing that for now there&#8217;s no word on this. In my March 2024 post, I suggested extra options such as the <em>Nintendo Badge Arcade</em> sticker system on 3DS, but now I feel as if I need to keep expectations in check. At this point, even a couple extra Themes would be great to see.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14928" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Themes menu even seems designed to hold more options</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As on the original Switch, the main way of showing personality is through your profile icon. Nintendo has added extra customisation options over time, particularly via the Nintendo Switch Online menu, where you can unlock new characters, backgrounds, and frames for your profile icon. Whilst it&#8217;s a mostly unchanged process from the Switch, I&#8217;m glad this bit of customisation is still present. I imagine it won&#8217;t be too long until we get more Joy-Con 2 colours, so at least there should soon be that avenue for customising the look of your console (if you have the expendable income). Considering how popular the Switch 2 is, it&#8217;d be wonderful to see more done on the digital side to allow players to show their personality. I hope we see developments in this area in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Enhanced Social Features: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth and final entry on this list regards the social aspects of the Switch &#8211; in my original post, this was primarily about having improved voice chat functions, and thankfully, this is the main social aspect where the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade! After years (and multiple console generations) of players asking, Nintendo has finally added an in-built party voice chat to the Switch 2, named GameChat. It&#8217;s now possible to talk to your registered friends over the internet, using the in-built microphone in the Switch (and Camera, if purchased), even if they are playing different software. Whilst it isn&#8217;t revolutionary &#8211; after all, other consoles have had similar systems for a long time &#8211; it&#8217;s a welcome addition that I&#8217;m very happy to see Nintendo include for the Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous Nintendo consoles have had forms of voice chat, but they always had some sort of catch &#8211; for example on the Switch, where voice chat was tied to the Switch Online mobile app. So, it&#8217;s great to see Nintendo introduce a more complete and in-built offering &#8211; if anything, I feel a bit bad, because I doubt I&#8217;ll use it much. As the years have passed, I&#8217;ve gotten used to using Discord as an alternative form of online chat when playing Nintendo games, because it&#8217;s been more convenient &#8211; and I think it&#8217;ll be hard to break out of that routine. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m very glad GameChat has been added for the Switch 2, and I commend Nintendo for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I hoped to see some sort of extensive social hub added, along the lines of Miiverse or StreetPass. The closest is the Nintendo Switch App, which has new functionality such as uploading screenshots, receiving GameChat notifications, and (most intriguingly) interacting with games such as <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (see the images below). But I miss the in-built communal aspects of previous systems, as they brought people together without as much push towards a mobile app. We still have the News channels to get specific updates on the topics and games you choose to follow, but these are mostly one-way interactions. Nintendo has done well in previous generations at creating unique spaces for players to help shape the multiplayer culture of their consoles, but Switch and Switch 2 feel a bit more controlled in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14922" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14921" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14923" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another aspect that the Switch 2 still lacks is an equivalent to Achievements or Trophies. This is something I used to think was a glaring omission, as it would be a great extra motivation to 100% games such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/04/30/lets-chat-a-long-overdue-super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>. But <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/16/why-ive-stopped-caring-so-much-about-achievements-trophies/">as years have gone by</a>, I have gained respect for Nintendo not having this sort of system, whether it be by conscious decision or simply a lack of intention to do so. There&#8217;s something freeing about playing games on the Switch, and indeed, the Switch 2 &#8211; there&#8217;s a lack of TV/streaming apps, or completion-style Achievement/Trophy systems, and instead the focus is all on the act of playing games. That laser-focus is really refreshing, and I&#8217;m not clamouring for those additions at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, whilst I&#8217;d like to see an expansion into a more communal gaming hub in the future, the Switch 2 definitely delivered on my hope for enhanced social features. The addition of GameChat is one of the major upgrades for the Switch 2, and a lot of marketing and development focus went into it, which shows Nintendo listened to player requests for this type of addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After going through those five points, how has the Switch 2 fared when it comes to my personal hopes for the console? Four of my five points were met to some degree of success, which I mark as a win overall. Evidently, Nintendo recognised the general areas where improvements could be made &#8211; and whilst not all of them were as emphatic an upgrade as I may have hoped, the cumulative progress makes for a significant leap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarise, I&#8217;m going to rattle back through the main points. Firstly, the eShop is much easier and faster to navigate, but could still do with more options for filters and user reviews. In addition, the console is a step up in power, and whilst it isn&#8217;t at the level of modern Microsoft and Sony consoles, games look brilliant and the hardware keeps Nintendo in the ballpark for third-party games. Speaking of which, we have received welcome news on <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, and seen the release of a new exciting Nintendo EAD game in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, and now we wait for the likes of <em>Pokémon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and other franchises to launch on the console. Sadly, Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added much in the way of system customization, but it has delivered new social options in the form of GameChat, finally bringing in-built party chat to a Nintendo console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the admitted caveats to some of the &#8220;Yes&#8221; points, I want to focus on the positives of the Switch 2. This is because, despite the iterative nature of the console, it does achieve that new-console feel. I was worried that it might feel like another specification of Switch instead of a brand new thing, but there are enough upgrades to ensure that isn&#8217;t the case. Much of this is down to the optimized power of the console, and how much snappier and responsive it is to play. But another contributing factor is the hardware itself &#8211; in handheld mode, the larger form factor and sleeker Joy-Con 2 designs feels fresh and streamlined, and the console has made playing in bed (for example) feel like a delightful high-end experience. I will say, it helps that I have massive hands, so the larger console size is more comfortable for me personally.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14952" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d like to see Nintendo continue to make software improvements to the Switch 2 &#8211; for example new eShop features, new menu Themes, and extra social hubs &#8211; but I&#8217;m left with a firmly positive impression of the console overall. I&#8217;ve been getting back into playing games more frequently recently, and I&#8217;m glad to say that the Switch 2 has been a contributing factor to that; and if I&#8217;m playing more games and having a good time doing so, that marks the Switch 2 as a success in my book!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this post!

As mentioned in that post, I was part-way through my first ever play through of <em>Diamond </em>at the time of writing. Of the two initial games (<em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>), <em>Pearl </em>was the one I got back in 2007, before then playing the third game <em>Platinum </em>when it released in 2009. I’ve kept my <em>Pearl </em>save to this day, whilst <em>Platinum </em>became the game I’d restart whenever I went back to play through Sinnoh &#8211; especially as it has extra content and various quality-of-life refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I hadn’t ever played <em>Diamond </em>until I felt compelled to buy myself a copy for £48.49 from GAME back in 2019. After all, <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>are second only to <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/07/11/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> in terms of my favourite games ever, so it’s lovely to have the complete set of three physical games. I’ve been gradually playing through <em>Diamond </em>ever since; in that aforementioned 2023 post, I noted that I’d reached the trek to Snowpoint City, roughly two-thirds of the way through the game. Since then, I&#8217;ve played a little bit more each year, finishing the villainous Team Galactic part of the main story, catching the cover Legendary Pokemon Dialga, and now preparing to tackle the Pokémon League!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-12 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14830" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14828" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14829" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14806" height="715" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve played through the Sinnoh-based <em>Pokémon</em> games, and the adventure feels a little different every time, for multiple reasons: , it might be the <em>Pokémon</em> team I choose, the approach I take, or how I’m feeling in my personal life at the time. With this being my first time playing <em>Diamond</em>, it&#8217;s felt unique once again &#8211; and as I gradually get ready to reach the end of the game (and start the postgame), I thought it’d be a nice point at which to write a journal-style post about the playthrough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, this journal approach matches my new writing method I’ve been testing, where I write a little bit every day, even if it’s just a paragraph or two. It’s helped me start posting at a more regular cadence recently, which I’ve really enjoyed, and am hoping to continue! I hope you’ll come with me on my retro-inspired ramble about my current adventuring in Sinnoh, and my plan to defeat the Pokémon League with a team that might be described as unconventional&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Shine Bright Like A&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this playthrough of <em>Diamond</em>, I decided not to create my character as “William”. I often style my avatar as myself on my first playthrough of a <em>Pokémon</em> game; but as I&#8217;ve played through Sinnoh many times before, I instead went for the approach I use on repeated playthroughs. In these situations, I like to create a new character persona, in a way that challenges my team selection, mixes up the gameplay, and allows me to add my own imaginary lore. Over the years, this has often led to me constructing a monotype team (usually Steel, my favourite type), but this time I went for a dichotomy theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14797" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14795" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The character I created is called Lucie, and I think of her as treading the line between both fiery and subdued personalities. Her starter is Chimchar, which will evolve into Infernape, one of the infamously few Fire type Pokémon in the core region of Sinnoh in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em> (the Elite Four member Flint has just two Fire types in their Fire-type team)! Two of the team slots are filled by a pair of Gastrodons (named Gianna and Gillian), a Pokémon which has two forms in Sinnoh: the pink West Sea Gastrodon, and the blue East Sea Gastrodon. By having one of each, it plays into that duality theming; I think of the pink Gastrodon as part of the &#8220;bright&#8221;, flamboyant side of the team, whilst the blue Gastrodon represents the &#8220;nocturnal&#8221;, subtler side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining the West Sea Gastrodon side of the team, we have the blazing Infernape (named Symphony), as well as Raichu (Ryland) and their electrifying moves. These Pokémon both deliver fast, strong damage: for example, Close Combat and Flare Blitz for Infernape, and Thunderbolt for Raichu. On the East Sea Gastrodon side is Noctowl (Miles), which has helpful status moves such as the sleep-inducing Hypnosis, as well as Skuntank (Skylah), which has Toxic for poisoning opponents and whittling them down. As you can probably tell, I&#8217;ve always liked to daydream up my own head canon for the characters and adventure. It helps every playthrough to feel unique, as if I&#8217;m adding extra world-building along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-14 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14793" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14791" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14787" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14788" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14790" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14789" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the team described above certainly isn&#8217;t the strongest possible for <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>&#8211; and I&#8217;m aware I&#8217;m making my life more difficult when it comes to battling the toughest trainers, such as the upcoming Elite Four and Champion Cynthia. But some of these Pokémon (especially Gastrodon, Nowtowl, and Skuntank) are Pokémon I&#8217;ve barely played with before, so I get to experience the challenge of Sinnoh in a brand new way! Mixing up the team helps every playthrough to feel fresh, and strengthens my personal connection with the team &#8211; not just now, but also when I look back on them years later, such as in a longevity app like <em>Pokémon HOME</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">A Girl&#8217;s Best Friend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;ve just finished working through Victory Road, reached the entrance to the Pokémon League, and completed the final fight against your in-game rival (on a whim, I named them Mervin). Relative to other games in the series, I&#8217;d argue that Sinnoh has the best Pokémon League &#8211; the members all have distinct personalities, and present a well-balanced challenge. The difficulty isn&#8217;t unfair, but requires you to take the League seriously; I&#8217;m currently in the phase of backtracking, training up the levels of my Pokémon, and refining the movesets, items, and strategies I&#8217;m going to approach the League with. With the team I&#8217;ve selected, it requires being very deliberate with my choices &#8211; of course, the main advantage I have is that I&#8217;m particularly familiar with the challenge that lies ahead, and can plan accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-15 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14817" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14811" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14821" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14820" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14818" height="168" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216" width="216" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14799" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sinnoh Pokémon League starts with the Bug-type trainer Aaron, who should be the easiest to defeat &#8211; Bug-types have many type weaknesses, such as to Fire and Flying, which my Infernape and Noctowl can target respectively. Next up will be Bertha and her Ground-type team, which will be a tougher test &#8211; the plethora of Ground attacks will be dangerous for Infernape and Raichu, so my two Gastrodons will be relied upon to use their Water-type moves. Noctowl has a useful immunity to Ground, and Skuntank can help out with Toxic, so my team has a decent amount of options for this battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is Flint, who as mentioned earlier, is a Fire-type trainer that curiously has three non-Fire types on their team. The two that are there &#8211; Rapidash and Infernape &#8211; should again struggle against the two Gastrodons, and then the rest of my team should be able to wear down Steelix, Drifblim, and Lopunny without too much issue. Then we&#8217;ll come to Lucian, the final member of the Elite Four, who has a Psychic-type team &#8211; and this is where Skuntank will have their turn taking centre stage, as their Dark typing makes them immune to Psychic moves. With the use of Night Slash (which has an elevated critical hit rate, boosted further by the equipped Razor Claw), Skuntank should carve through a lot of the opponents, with the help of Infernape to tackle the Steel typing of Bronzong.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-16 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14808" height="542" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721" width="721" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14810" height="548" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727" width="727" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing this plan out, it makes me fairly confident at defeating the Elite Four without too much trouble. However, players of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>know that the toughest challenge lies with Champion Cynthia and her excellent team of strong and varied Pokémon (which even includes a Gastrodon of her own)! The biggest threat is her ace Pokémon &#8211; Garchomp &#8211; which can likely take out most of my team with one hit from an Earthquake. My best options are going to be my two Gastrodons, which have strong defensive stats, and can use Blizzard and Ice Beam to hit the double Ice weakness of Garchomp. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll rely on Noctowl and Hypnosis, to give myself some more time. It&#8217;s going to be a nervy battle, but there are routes to success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">In Reflection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage of the game, where I&#8217;m backtracking and gradually training up my Pokémon, showcases some of why I adore <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>so much. In theory, this part could be tiresome, gradually grinding through the experience points needed to make my team stronger &#8211; but instead, I find it tranquil. There&#8217;s something magical about the way music, visuals, and gameplay combine in these games specifically, and I enjoy taking my time; one of the main places I&#8217;m training is Victory Road, as I can access a variety of strong wild Pokémon there. Near the entrance is a useful Pokémon Center for healing your team, and I often pause to listen to the &#8220;Pokémon League&#8221; music that plays outside it. This particular track has both &#8220;Day&#8221; and &#8220;Night&#8221; versions, and the latter is especially beautiful (you can listen below). It&#8217;s a beautifully delicate composition, and captures the feeling of being near the end of an amazing adventure, but with so much still left to enjoy, and no need to rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to this music is just one example of the catharsis I feel when playing <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, which is something I talked about back in my 2023 post. This sentiment comes from a place of both subjectivity and objectivity, as my emotional connection to these games is incredibly strong. After my older sister passed away in 2007, I spent hundreds of hours exploring Sinnoh, and I&#8217;m forever grateful to the soothing effect they had &#8211; and still have &#8211; on me. There are many positive aspects I associate with this: the meticulous sprite artwork and colour palette; the endearing Pokémon and character designs; the region full of secrets to explore; the sprawling Underground; and that amazing soundtrack, just to name a handful of reasons why I love these games so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I prepare to enter the Pokémon League, I&#8217;ve also started thinking about the postgame, which in <em>Diamond </em>includes a whole separate island northeast of Sinnoh, named the Battle Zone (see the map below). It includes the Fight Area, Resort Area, and Survival Area, plus Stark Mountain. The Fight Area includes the Battle Tower in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>, which is less extensive than the expanded Battle Frontier in <em>Platinum</em>, but still offers plenty of challenge and longevity. I love the sheer amount of space left to discover in the postgame; this island is like an extra enclosed region to explore. Currently, I&#8217;m undecided on whether I&#8217;ll dive straight into this after the Pokémon League, or take a break and come back at a later time.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14813" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I&#8217;m well acquainted with the celebratory feel of the Battle Zone island, and may well get drawn into playing it immediately! After the high of defeating the Pokémon League, it&#8217;s wonderful to realise there&#8217;s still so much left for your Pokémon and you to explore. The Battle Zone has a vacation vibe, especially as you initially take a ship to get there &#8211; and the music is also uplifting and energetic, for example Route 225, which feels like a burst of energy, complete with the iconic clapping (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQvx9STW1V0">go to 00:42 in this video</a>)! Overall, the Battle Zone has a celebratory feel, and adds a lot to the overall package of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. I&#8217;m excited for the character of Lucie to extend her adventure, and take her dual-themed team onwards and upwards!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Space and Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope with this post is that it shone a light on two things: the reasons that set this playthrough of <em>Diamond </em>apart, and more detail on why I have such a strong connection to <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. They are such special games to me personally, and for a long time, I&#8217;ve considered how to do that connection justice on this site. The 2023 post was a very cathartic one for me to write, and this post is an extension of that. It&#8217;s amazing how our personal circumstances can affect our thoughts on games (and other forms of media) &#8211; and I love hearing about these stories from other people too, as it often sparks positive discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14850" height="514" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827" width="827" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that down the line, I get to write another post about <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, talking about how the character of Lucie faced the Pokémon League, and then ventured into the postgame and Battle Zone. Down the line, I&#8217;ll likely inevitably play <em>Pokémon Platinum</em> again, and that&#8217;ll continue to be the game I go back to for replaying Sinnoh.

This is the first brand new <em>Mario Kart</em> on consoles since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> on Wii U back in 2014 (the Switch received an upgraded version, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, in 2017, which I skipped) &#8211; so at least for me personally, it&#8217;s felt a long time coming. Mixed in with the excitement of a brand new Nintendo console, it made the launch of <em>Mario Kart World</em> feel like a real event, especially when played with friends, which is where <em>Mario Kart</em> always excels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, in various different configurations: both on the TV and in handheld, in solo, local co-op, and online with a friend. Now, I&#8217;ve reached a point where I feel I can state a comprehensive opinion on the game, having experienced both the racing modes and the open world that&#8217;s a major selling point of this iteration of <em>Mario Kart</em>. My thoughts are overall very positive, but there are also some flawed aspects to the game  &#8211; but I&#8217;ll expand upon this more later on in the review. Without further ado then, let&#8217;s get into it!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Start Your Engines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it was the new-console glow, or perhaps it was that wait since <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, but launching into <em>Mario Kart World</em> for the first time felt distinctly special. The game encourages you straight into exploring the open world first; this consists of the various tracks connected by open spaces of road, field, water, desert, and more. What&#8217;s immediately remarkable about the game is just how gorgeous it looks, both in handheld but also especially when played on a 4K HDR TV &#8211; and whilst this isn&#8217;t new technology, it&#8217;s wonderful to play Nintendo games in such high fidelity via the Switch 2. The visual direction of <em>Mario Kart World</em> makes brilliant use of the new hardware, presenting a world full of vibrancy, colour, and personality &#8211; which is shown in the track designs, whether it&#8217;s the bustling Shy Guy Bazaar, the scrumptious Sky-High Sundae, or the fiery Bowser&#8217;s Castle, just to name three!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-17 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14727" height="574" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mkw_sgb_view.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14724" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14725" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_17.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The infused personality is evident in the roster of characters (complete with various different unlockable outfits). Returning are your usual suspects like Mario, Luigi, Peach, and so forth; additionally, there are plenty of newcomers, including minor enemies such as Konkdor and Cataquack, and even bit-part characters such as Dolphin and, of course, Cow! If you&#8217;ve seen any discourse about <em>Mario Kart World</em> since the initial announcement, you&#8217;ll know that the Cow and their adorable grin has captured the attention of the internet, and I&#8217;ve had a wonderful time watching the various memes and edits their inclusion has spawned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the characters have a range of changeable outfits too, which are unlocked by collecting Dash Food bags from vendors in races or the open world. It adds an extra way to differentiate the characters, ranging from punk rock biker looks to desert outfits and much more in between &#8211; and they can be combined with the plentiful different karts and bikes to create the aesthetic you&#8217;re looking for. A Photo Mode has been added in tandem with this, giving plentiful options for taking pictures that show off the world and characters as you see fit. Me being me, I&#8217;m sad that we got an Explorer outfit Toad but no actual Captain Toad&#8230; But there&#8217;s always time for that in DLC, hopefully!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14754" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A smorgasbord of Yoshi! Or Yoshis? Yoshies?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The attention to detail in both audio and graphic effects is especially apparent when you build up speed. Karts and bikes camber side-to-side when they hop and drift; tyres are spongey and visibly bounce and recoil according to the track surface; and sparks crackle off your vehicle as you drift and build up a boost, just to name a small handful of the details I&#8217;m talking about. I particularly like the tension of drifting around the sharpest corners, with the screen often tilting with you and making it extra satisfying to hit the apex. Plus, the music is noticeably exceptional, supplying a consistently energetic chorus that accentuates the gameplay &#8211; especially in the final unlockable tracks, which supply a climactic crescendo unlike any other I&#8217;ve experienced in <em>Mario Kart</em>. Overall, the whole experience is lifted by this pristine look and feel, whether it&#8217;s the relatively laid-back open world, or the competitive modes, where the palpable sense of momentum is most gripping. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a Knockout!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the &#8220;World&#8221; being a key selling point of the game, it&#8217;s still those core competitive modes that retained the tightest grip on my attention. Whilst the expected familiar selection of Grand Prix, custom VS, Battle, and Time Trial modes are all here, the game deserves credit for also introducing a brand new main mode to go alongside Grand Prix. This goes by the name of Knockout Tour, where 6 different tracks are combined together into one extra-long race. It takes advantage of the increased count of 24 racers to introduce checkpoint gates along the way, eliminating those at the back each time. Essentially, it&#8217;s a way of introducing popular battle royale-esque sensibilities into <em>Mario Kart</em>, and it creates a very fun sense of chaos &#8211; especially in local multiplayer, when your friends and you are desperately trying to stay in the race amidst the various items flying around!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14736" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A road trip across the Mushroom Kingdom! Thankfully, less traffic jams than real life</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Knockout Tours are arguably the biggest challenge awaiting completionist solo players in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It&#8217;s classic knowledge now that to get the maximum 3-star rating in Grand Prix, you need to win all four races; but in Knockout Tour, you need to be leading through every single checkpoint! This is an extremely tough task, as it necessitates not just victory, but to be consistently leading &#8211; even despite homing Red Shells, or the dreaded blue Spiny Shells that target the leader. I set myself the personal challenge of 3-starring every Knockout Tour, and it led to many failed attempts, but it was highly satisfying when I finally achieved that goal. For <em>Mario Kart</em> veterans, it&#8217;s a good addition to have a target that takes this extra level of dedication to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just mentioned the items and the chaos synonymous with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and that side of the game is just as entertaining (and frustrating) as ever before! To me, <em>Mario Kart</em> is similar to other games such as <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> because at their core, each iteration is built on the same gameplay loop, and it makes it tough to critique a new entry &#8211; on one hand, it&#8217;d be unwise to stray too far from what makes the series so immensely popular, but on the other, there has to be enough new ideas to justify a new game that still feels imaginative.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-18 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14737" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14738" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14740" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As aforementioned, the Knockout Tours are a standout way in which <em>Mario Kart World</em> achieves the latter, and some of these ideas bleed over into Grand Prix, where you don&#8217;t just drive around four tracks &#8211; instead, after the first race, the initial laps are rolling starts, as you drive across the world to the next track, road-trip style. It&#8217;s a neat way to keep the same formula but match it to the open-world aesthetic of <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and in VS there are options to play either in this mode, or with the traditional laps, catering to either preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further to this, there are tweaks to the racing itself, the most notable arguably being the new parkour/trick abilities. If you drive up onto a rail, you can grind along it and perform extra trick boosts, and you can even trick onto a wall and wall-ride along it, which opens up jaw-dropping shortcuts if you master this ability (there are plenty of astonishing clips doing the rounds online)! On top of this, drifting boosts can now be used in a straight line, and launch you off the ground slightly to help initiate some of these parkour moves. In combination, all these extra options elevate the height of the skill ceiling, and keep <em>Mario Kart World</em> engaging for those who have mastered previous entries in the series. Crucially, it does this without losing the accessibility as a go-to local multiplayer party game &#8211; the extra skills are a cherry on top for those who want to go above and beyond, but they&#8217;re not essential for winning races against the CPU.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14755" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Boo Cinema is another standout track, which applies a film filter to part of the course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Items are one of the infamous levellers of <em>Mario Kart</em>, and there have been some tweaks and additions on this front too. Your usual roster of shells, bananas, and mushrooms, and more are all here, although it&#8217;s noticeable that the raw power of items such as Bullet Bill have been slightly softened, perhaps to accommodate the new racer count of 24. Some of the notable new items include the golden Coin Shell, which leaves a trail of coins behind it, and the feather, which leaps you into the air, opening another opportunity to perform tricks, wallrides, and other shortcuts. To more literally aid more inexperienced players, there are still the helpful options for motion controls, auto-accelerate, and driving aids. Whilst these aren&#8217;t new, they&#8217;re still great to see return, and are often essential for balanced 4-player sessions that everyone can enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Give Me a Boost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As fun as <em>Mario Kart</em> can be in solo play, multiplayer is where the series has always shined brightest, and that continues to be the case for <em>World</em>. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to play with several combinations of friends, and the game has impressively accommodated their varying levels of <em>Mario Kart</em> experience each time, whether they&#8217;re a fresh newcomer or someone who&#8217;s been away from the series for a while. It&#8217;s easy to criticize the items when they&#8217;re hitting you, but they do a great job at helping those towards the back stay with the pack, and there&#8217;s still the option to use items such as shells and bananas defensively whilst in the lead.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14743" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Expect to shout at your friends &#8211; in a pleasant way, of course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Local multiplayer has consistently resulted in a brilliant time, complete with the playful shouting, cheers, and competitive back-and-forth that you hope for from <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; so I can report that it&#8217;s a success in that department! My favourite local multiplayer option is the extended custom VS modes, which have plenty of customisable options, including speed, difficulty, item frequency, and the amount of races, which go up to 32 at a time. As a big Formula 1 fan, I love to nerd out about the accumulated points and the drama of how the final standings will end up, so VS will inevitably become my most-played mode!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of online play, <em>Mario Kart World</em> doesn&#8217;t quite hit the same heights as local multiplayer, because of that lack of immediate in-person reaction &#8211; and whilst it&#8217;s admirable that Nintendo has added chat functionality, I did end up defaulting to using a Discord call instead, because of the familiarity and ease of use. The main motivation to play online is to raise your versus rating (VR), which is essentially the same system we had way back on <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>. In my opinion, it&#8217;s disappointing that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added more reasons to play online, especially in a gaming landscape where online games consistently add new modes, tournaments, and other rewards for playing consistently. The end result is that I quickly fell off of online multiplayer, and have focused mostly on solo and local multiplayer.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14753" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Driving on water supplies opportunity to perform tricks as you bounce over the waves</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, I found that the returning Battle Mode was most ideal for multiplayer &#8211; in <em>World</em>, there are two options, Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, which will be familiar to players of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. Balloon Battle gives you five balloons to protect whilst doing your best to hit opponents and earn points for removing their balloons, and Coin Runners has you searching for as many coins as you can, whilst again attempting to hit others and remove their coins (whilst avoiding them doing the same to you). I have to say, I&#8217;ve never been a huge Battle Mode fan over the years, and this version hasn&#8217;t changed that &#8211; but conversely, if you love Battle Mode, this will fill that quota well. My main disappointment is that the modes are time-based instead of score-based, as I generally prefer having that concrete target and the tension of seeing who can reach it first. Despite my criticisms, I am glad Battle Mode is back, as it offers a welcome change of pace from the racing modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Free as a Birdo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, a major differentiator for <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the inclusion of a free roam mode, where you can explore the tracks (and the spaces between them) at your leisure. There&#8217;s certainly an immediate novelty to this &#8211; I have nostalgic memories of <em>LEGO Racers 2</em>, which I played a lot on PC as a child, and included a similar experience of exploring an open world between races in a colourful, family-friendly world. My hope was that <em>Mario Kart World</em> might recapture that whimsical feeling, and supply a world with plenty of secrets and rewards, and most importantly motivation to find them. At first, <em>World </em>is successful in this; one of my earliest ventures was rocking up to the Dino Dino Jungle area, and visiting the inner laboratory/auditorium section. With precise driving and the careful use of tricks, you can make your way to the top of this area &#8211; which is thrilling the first time, but soon the realisation kicks in that there&#8217;s a lack of reason to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-19 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14746" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14747" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14745" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in free roam,<em> Mario Kart World </em>has an uncanny sense of emptiness, and it&#8217;s partly because that palpable sense of forward energy &#8211; which is so prevalent in the competitive modes &#8211; is gone, without being replaced by much else. It&#8217;s not that there isn&#8217;t anything to do in the open world &#8211; for example, there are Peach Medallions and Question Mark Panels to find, as well as P Switches that activate various challenges &#8211; but the problem is that there isn&#8217;t much motivation to track all these things down. The main rewards are stickers, which are small graphic icons you can attach next to your profile name, and feel inconsequential. More work needed to be done to make the world feel alive, and not just like a suspended state of limbo from the Grand Prix mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toads and Shy Guys milling around and making campfires are a great touch, but they&#8217;re another short-lived novelty that doesn&#8217;t add substance to the experience of navigating the open world. It&#8217;s fun to find items and complete challenges, but they&#8217;re incredibly scattered &#8211; and whilst there&#8217;s a tracker for the Question Mark Panels, there&#8217;s curiously no in-game indicator for how many Medallions or Switches are left to find (and also no statistics or records screen for other modes, either). On the other hand, something free roam does do well is increasing the level of awe the world has. You can travel a long way out into the ocean, and discover sea dragons, whales, and more, and I had a great time inspecting the scale of impressive courses such as DK Spaceport. As mentioned at the start of the review, <em>Mario Kart World</em> is a stunning game to look at and listen to, and the open world gives you more time to do just that.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14748" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>P Switch challenges often consist of time trials</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s a great shame that there&#8217;s no formal splitscreen multiplayer for the open world &#8211; there&#8217;s a partial workaround, by loading into an empty wireless mode lobby, but challenges are turned off, and it&#8217;s not at all optimal. In a game marketed on free roam, and in a series known for local multiplayer, it&#8217;s a disappointing oversight that significantly reduces the reason to play this way. I have occasionally played free roam in single-player as a laid-back secondary experience, for example when listening to a podcast or talking to friends &#8211; but it has untapped potential as a playground for friends to enjoy together, and honestly, I think this would&#8217;ve papered over many of my problems with the emptiness of the open world. Instead, more often than not, you&#8217;ll launch straight into Grand Prix, Knockout Tour, or VS, as that is where the most joyous parts of <em>Mario Kart World</em> reside.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to the end of this review, I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;ve flagged multiple issues I have with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; so I need to re-emphasize that this is a genuinely excellent <em>Mario Kart</em> game, that not only delivers the best-looking and best-sounding entry into the series, but has multiple new ideas and modes that make it feel distinct. Changeable character outfits, new trick mechanics, and especially the Knockout Tour mode supply fresh style that have made <em>World </em>my new go-to local multiplayer game, and a game I&#8217;ve spent many an enjoyable hour in by myself as well. The main disappointment has to be the free roam mode, which feels sparse and quickly struggles to retain player attention &#8211; and I really hope that in the future, Nintendo supports the game with additional content that fills out this world more. Alternatively, add Captain Toad to the playable characters, and I&#8217;ll probably be happy, haha! In all seriousness, <em>Mario Kart World</em> definitely has flaws, but the core racing experience is dazzling, and it&#8217;s a superb way to start the Switch 2 era!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

I&#8217;ve written about this in multiple posts on this site, and I&#8217;ve noticed how I&#8217;m gradually getting deeper into the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> ecosystem: starting with looking back to the anime, and then playing the online game <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and now getting more invested in learning about the current meta and competitive side of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> is a complicated game with lots to learn (and relearn) for someone like me, who hasn&#8217;t been up-to-date on the meta since I stopped playing local tournaments about a decade-and-a-half-ago. But I&#8217;m slowly learning, and I&#8217;m enjoying how it&#8217;s happening naturally, via watching various YouTube creators, playing different decks in <em>Master Duel</em>, and even constructing a real-life deck that I could conceivably return to local tournaments with. So, in this post, I&#8217;m going to talk a little more about these various aspects of the game, the deck I&#8217;m playing, and why I&#8217;m enjoying this process so much!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Getting the Fire (Kings) Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve already written about <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/12/31/why-im-giving-yu-gi-oh-master-duel-another-shot/">how I&#8217;ve gotten back into <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em></a>, but only now have I reached the point where I&#8217;m starting to understand the competitive meta. At first, I was playing relatively low-powered (by current standards) decks such as Dark Magician and Monarchs, because those cards were familiar to me. But realistically, those decks aren&#8217;t fast-paced enough to keep up nowadays, so I started testing other avenues. I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of Gravekeepers, which can sometimes work in the competitive scene, if you draw the right cards (such as Necrovalley) in order to shut off abilities from the opponent. But this wasn&#8217;t a strategy that was going to help me learn the competitive game long-term, and I found that I eventually reached a point of repetition and subsequent burnout playing the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-20 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14664" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14665" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14666" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gravekeepers brought me a decent level of success!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This brought me to the HERO cards, especially Destiny HEROs, as I have a nostalgic affinity for them. The modern HERO cards have many combo effects that special summon various powerful cards, so they were much more helpful for learning the increased modern speed of combos in a deck. But I still found the HERO cards to lack flexibility for different situations, and I again reached a point where I hit a brick wall with the deck. It felt like I had hit also hit a wall in my efforts to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> in a contemporary fashion, as I couldn&#8217;t find a deck I clicked with. So I took a bit of a break from <em>Master Duel</em>, and started looking into which decks would be viable to assemble if I was playing the physical TCG (Trading Card Game). After looking at various Structure Decks as starting points, I finally found one which made sense to test out: Fire Kings!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire Kings are a deck based around monsters that destroy themselves either on the field, in the hand, or from the deck, to then activate various effects, including summoning monsters and destroying cards on the field. In addition, they have an impressive boss monster in &#8220;Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings&#8221;, which can destroy every other monster on the field (and has a magnificent summoning animation in <em>Master Duel</em>, see below)! The fiery aesthetic of these cards is well-realised in the stunning artwork, which mixes regal distinction with blazing power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-21 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14678" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14674" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14676" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14677" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14675" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Master Duel summon animations are, in a word, awesome</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the cards are relatively accessible in the real world, with only &#8220;Fire King Courtier Ulcanix&#8221; demanding a higher price point (of about £15 a copy). Most of the main Fire King cards can be acquired in the modestly priced Fire King Structure Deck &#8211; I bought three copies of this, as well as some other products (such as the recent Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Deck, which includes reprints of staple cards such as Infinite Impermanence), to construct a real-life Fire King deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, I find it helpful to have a real deck in front of me, which I can draw test hands with to slowly understand the playstyle better (I&#8217;m hoping for a reprint of Ulcanix, so I don&#8217;t have to drop £45-ish on a playset)! The result of this process is finally finding an archetype I like, which is viable to build in both <em>Master Duel</em> and the TCG &#8211; and to top it all off, Fire Kings are competitively strong too! Whilst they aren&#8217;t currently considered a top tier deck like Maliss or Ryzeal, Fire Kings do perform well in current competitive play, even winning the YCS Birmingham event this year, piloted by Dinh-Kha Bui! This tells me that if I can improve my own skill and understanding of the deck, then Fire King can reach a high ceiling of play in both <em>Master Duel</em> and local tournaments (should I decide to go&#8230; More on that later)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14669" height="696" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>It needs some changes still, but my TCG Fire King deck is taking shape!</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m playing lots of Fire King in Ranked games on <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and with every game, every new scenario, and every mistake I make (I&#8217;m admittedly still making a lot of those), I&#8217;m learning the intricacies of the deck, how to perform the best combos, and how to make the strongest boards in combination with my Extra Deck of Link, XYZ, and Synchro Monsters. I like how Fire Kings have such a strong Fire connection, which enables them to make use of several non-Fire cards as additions to the deck. For example, a common choice for Fire Kings is &#8220;Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames&#8221;, which can revive back one of your Fire Kings alongside it when summoned. This synergy is very satisfying, and ties into the overall theme of the deck, resulting in an archetype that feels richly-designed and well-realised. I&#8217;m enjoying learning the Fire King strategies, and I hope that by my next <em>Master Duel</em> post on this site, I can report that I&#8217;ve become steadily better at piloting the deck!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Creators I Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside my own proactive efforts to become better at contemporary <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I&#8217;ve been watching several YouTube creators that are a brilliant source of both entertainment and knowledge for me. <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/">In previous posts, I&#8217;ve mentioned</a> how TGS Anime and Team APS helped me get reacquainted with classic <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, which lines up with my aforementioned play of anime decks such as Dark Magician. I still watch these channels, but I&#8217;ve added several others to my regular watchlist, including the &#8220;wonky quartet&#8221; of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGuDrveqBgD0S9nqaOPw6Q">Farfa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MBTYuGiOh">MBT</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Nyhmnim">Nyhmnim</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dzeeff">Dzeeff</a>, who consistently create great content focused primarily around <em>Master Duel</em>. Often, they add fun variables to challenge themselves, such as in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xajsij7iS98">Master Chef</a> series by MBT, or the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbldWY88--A">Storage Wars</a> series by Farfa.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Videos like this (by Joshua Schmidt) are brilliant at showcasing both the fun and skill of </em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly thanks to these channels and their collaborations, I&#8217;ve also become aware of other popular YouTubers &#8211; specifically, ones focused around high-level competitive play. These are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaSchmidtYGO">Joshua Schmidt</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jessekottonygo">Jesse Kotton</a>, who are well-known for often winning or placing highly in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> tournaments. Both of them balance speaking confidently about modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> with also making videos that are fun to watch, which is very impressive and makes them stand out. Both their channels have been helpful to me, and I also like it when they have those earlier-mentioned collaborations with channels like Farfa and MBT, as they bring a little bit of extra seriousness to those videos. Discovering this range of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> players and creators has been an unexpected extra positive side effect of getting back into the game and franchise!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">It&#8217;s Time to Duel?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;ve talked about how I&#8217;ve not just been looking at the digital version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> (with <em>Master Duel</em>), but also my physical collection of cards as well. I have a fairly large amount of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> cards, mostly from my childhood and teenage years, and further supplemented with occasional more recent purchases when something has stood out to me. Those Fire King and Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Decks have given me access to plenty of modern cards to assemble a deck with, and I also picked up products like the Duel Devastator set from 2019, which was full of guaranteed competitive staples like &#8220;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&#8221;. This is all to say that I&#8217;m nearing a place where not only am I improving at <em>Master Duel</em>, but I could conceivably go to an in-person event near me and test out my skills in person (scary, I know, haha)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14673" height="672" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Recent structure decks have been ideal for helping me build Fire Kings</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Jokes aside, there&#8217;s only a few things stopping me from doing this, and one of them is overcoming that social anxiety. I&#8217;ve become better at this over the years, but I definitely find the initial ice-breaking of heading to a new club/group quite daunting. About a year ago, I also experienced this when joining a nearby running club &#8211; there is that initial awkward stage of getting to know people and faces, but it gets easier over time. I&#8217;m confident that this wouldn&#8217;t be a long-term issue, especially as I now know a friend who has introduced me to a local store that hosts Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next barrier is more closely related to the theme of this post &#8211; and that&#8217;s a personal target to be relatively well-acquainted with the game before showing up to a local tournament again. I&#8217;m definitely nearing this stage, and part of this preparation would be making the finishing touches to my Fire King deck. I&#8217;d like to get that playset of three Fire King Courtier Ulcanix first, as they&#8217;re integral to the strength of the deck. The card is out of stock on most sites, and my best route currently seems to be waiting for a good UK price on Cardmarket. I could wait and hope for a cheaper reprint, but there is no sign of this happening at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jesse Kotton has a video about Fire Kings and their affordability</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I&#8217;d like to get a copy of some extra staple Extra Deck cards such as &#8220;S:P Little Knight&#8221;, and possibly acquire some extra non-Fire King cards that often seen play in the deck, such as &#8220;Bystial Magnamhut&#8221; and &#8220;Bystial Druisworm&#8221;. The main thing I&#8217;m keeping an eye on is price &#8211; for example, in an ideal world I&#8217;d also add competitively strong cards such as &#8220;Mulcharmy Fuwalos&#8221; to the deck, but that would cost another £70-ish for a playset, and I haven&#8217;t even gone to a local event yet (I do have a tendency for overthinking)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve still not decided if I&#8217;ll make the time to make the leap to playing the TCG in-person again, but I&#8217;m getting increasingly tempted to have a go. It would enable me to test out my skills, and it could also be a way to make new friends and connections. When I went to local events in my teenage years, I enjoyed the trading side of the game too &#8211; and who knows, perhaps that&#8217;s a better way to acquire some of these missing cards for my Fire King deck. If I do decide to go, I hope to write up about my experience on this site, however well (or badly, haha) it goes!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the third <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> centric post I&#8217;ve written over the last 8 months, and they&#8217;re good reflections of how I&#8217;ve gotten back into the franchise as a whole: not just my nostalgic connection, but how I&#8217;ve been learning about the modern game and how it&#8217;s evolved over time. I admittedly used to be someone who lamented that <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> had become too complicated and suffered from power creep &#8211; and whilst those aren&#8217;t completely untrue, I think they were oversimplifications on my part. Having now taken the time to ingrain myself back into the world of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I see that the game has developed into something new &#8211; something faster, more complex, and in some ways arguably better than before.</p>\n\n\n\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top: 75%;">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this post has explained how I&#8217;m pushing myself to get better at the game, with the conduit of a Fire King deck as my resource for playing the game at a higher skill level than before. I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn still, both about this deck and other decks, but I&#8217;m having an excellent time doing so &#8211; which is probably evidenced by me considering playing the TCG in-person again at some point in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this post, and I sincerely hope you are happy, healthy, and having a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/03/how-fire-kings-are-helping-me-learn-competitive-play-in-yu-gi-oh-master-duel/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Right then, let&#8217;s get into the post, and I hope you enjoy the read!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Edinburgh Marathon 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/">my build-up and training for the Edinburgh Marathon</a> multiple times since I started planning in November 2024, and after a train journey up to Edinburgh and a couple of days in the city, on May 25th 2025 the day finally arrived for my first marathon! My parents and some close friends were there to support me, and I also had the support of all those who contributed to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">my charity fundraiser for Beat</a> (the Eating Disorder charity). Thank you to everyone who donated or even just took a look at my Justgiving page &#8211; I&#8217;m really proud to spread awareness for a charity that means a lot to both my family and I.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14636" height="607" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So, you may be asking, how did the marathon go? It was a tough one, and Scotland threw all the elements at us. There were periods of sun, rain, strong winds, and even hail when I reached approximately mile 20! As expected, the last 10-ish miles are where the battle really begins, as much mental as physical. It was important to me that I do my absolute best and never stop or walk if I can help it, and at mile 25 I got to see my friends and family cheer me on as I neared the finish line!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was an unexpectedly dramatic finish. With the finish line in sight, and as I pushed for the line with maybe 100 metres left to go, I was struck with the notorious &#8220;jelly legs&#8221; and fell. I managed to get back to my feet with the help of another nearby runner, and made it to the line. As someone who is very critical of themselves, I was disappointed at not finishing the run in better style &#8211; and this is where my family and friends were invaluable at stopping me from being too harsh on myself. It was a great reminder of how much they care for me and how much support I had on the day, and I am incredibly grateful to them and everyone else who has congratulated me since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-22 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14624" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Early on&#8230; !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14622" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the race</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14623" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final stretch!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Including Gift Aid, we raised £1,821.77 for Beat, and I&#8217;m very proud of this, as well as the personal achievement of finishing the marathon. I&#8217;m still deciding whether or not to do another marathon &#8211; after not finishing in quite the way I hoped, I am feeling motivated to do another one, maybe the Norfolk Marathon in 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest gaming news stories over the last few months has been the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. As not only a gaming fan but also specifically a Nintendo fan, I got my console immediately, and have been playing it a significant amount since! Whilst it&#8217;s more of an iteration than a revolution in terms of hardware, I personally enjoy the larger console and screen size, as it fits my larger hands very well. The only exclusive game I have so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I&#8217;ve put many an hour into!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14620" height="534" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, <em>Mario Kart World</em> feels like the first new entry since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> many years ago, as I played a lot of the latter on Wii U and never felt the need to buy the <em>Deluxe</em> version on Switch. Therefore, <em>World</em> feels very fresh to me, and it&#8217;s also visually spectacular (especially on a big 4K HDR TV). I&#8217;ve 3-starred all the Grand Prix and am now working away at the Knockout Tours, which are battle-royale style checkpoint races new to this game. These Knockout Tours are very tough to get 3-stars on, but I&#8217;m enjoying the challenge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a few criticisms of the game &#8211; including my own biased disappointment at no inclusion of Captain Toad, haha &#8211; but also about the open-world twist on the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula. In concept, it&#8217;s a smart way to go, but I have mixed feelings on the execution, as the world feels a little empty and repetitive to explore. Despite this, I&#8217;m going to save my full thoughts, as I plan to write a dedicated review at some point soon. One thing is for sure, and that&#8217;s <em>Mario Kart World</em> being the new go-to local multiplayer game for my friends and I!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the Switch 2 itself, it does feel like an investment for the future, as outside of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and now <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> (which I hope to play soon), there&#8217;s a lack of headline exclusive titles. But for now, the hardware upgrade and promise for the future &#8211; plus the fun of <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; has made it feel worth the purchase for this Nintendo fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-text-align-left">My watching habits have been quite eclectic recently! In terms of the films, the standout has to be <em>Superman</em> &#8211; as a huge DC fan, I had high hopes for this fresh, brighter take on the iconic character, and James Gunn and company thoroughly delivered. The film is a shining beacon of positivity, fun, and creativity, and David Corenswet is a brilliant Superman to centre the new DCU around. I&#8217;m very excited to see where things go in the future, but for now I&#8217;m just so happy that we got a satisfyingly hopeful take on Superman again. I&#8217;m hoping that these vibes continue in <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> on the Marvel side, which I&#8217;m going to see tomorrow as of writing this!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-23 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14617" height="1023" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg?w=819" width="819" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14618" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg?w=691" width="691" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of TV, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to <em>The Walking Dead</em> (I really liked the recent film <em>28 Years Later</em>, and I think it&#8217;s helped put me in the zombie mood). I originally stopped watch <em>The Walking Dead</em> in Season 8, which is where a lot of people dropped off, in the war between Rick and Negan. However, I heard that it picks up afterwards, so I decided to go back, charge through Season 8, and see what I find in those last few seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst Season 8 remains a poorly-paced season, I&#8217;m glad I went back, especially because Season 9 is brilliant TV. Clearly lessons were learned from the negative reception to previous seasons, and Season 9 focuses back on character development, inventive new threats, and grounded emotional stakes. It hooked me in and I&#8217;m enjoying the ride of these last few seasons!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m already looking ahead to watching the newer <em>The Walking Dead</em> spin-offs such as <em>The Ones Who Live</em> and <em>Daryl Dixon</em>, to see where these characters end up. Other than <em>The Walking Dead</em>, I&#8217;m also slowly making my way through the latest Marvel show <em>Ironheart</em>, which hasn&#8217;t been marketed very well by Disney &#8211; which is a shame, as it&#8217;s very well-made and full of great performances.  To loop back around to <em>Superman</em> and the DCU, I&#8217;m also eagerly anticipating <em>Peacemaker</em> Season 2, which will tie into that film and the larger world!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this summation of some of what I&#8217;ve been up to recently! One of my goals for the rest of the year is to start writing here more consistently &#8211; I&#8217;ve been saying this for a while, but it&#8217;s something I really want to get back to. It&#8217;s been necessary for me to spend more time on my personal life and take breaks from writing, but in the process of that personal growth, it&#8217;s reminded me how much I like writing about the things I play, watch, and do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I often get distracted or hit writer&#8217;s block, so I&#8217;m considering the approach of setting aside a little bit of time every day to write with no background music/videos, as opposed to my previous strategy of writing in big time chunks all at once. Either way, I&#8217;m planning to be more present on here in the second half of the year, and I look forward to it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sincerely hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a wonderful day!

Many hours of my weekends have been devoted to building up my distance; I am a longtime runner, but had never ran more than a half-marathon before my marathon training this year. Last weekend I did my longest run, a 23.2-miler (my poor legs), and I&#8217;m now tapering down before the big day. My mental health has been low recently, and the marathon has been a good target for my mind to try and focus on, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14584" height="560" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025"><em>https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m both excited and nervous for the event, for which I will be journeying to Edinburgh a few days beforehand. I&#8217;m also doing the run to fundraise for <a href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/">Beat, the Eating Disorder charity</a> &#8211; this is a cause close to my heart, as my amazing sister Charlotte passed away in 2007 after battling anorexia. As aforementioned in my previous post, you can view my Justgiving page <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">at this link</a>, and any donations would be very much appreciated, but there&#8217;s no pressure at all to donate!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Upcoming Book Projects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a designer for Titan Books, I get to work on some really exciting projects, and honestly that fulfilment in my work means a lot to me &#8211; it&#8217;s very rewarding to have a physical product of your work, especially when it&#8217;s related to a property (such as Marvel or <em>Star Trek</em>) that you enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get to experience working on several exciting film retrospectives, and some upcoming ones from Titan include books on <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>,<em> </em>The Crow films, and <em>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</em>, which you can see covers for below!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-24 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14562" height="904" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706" width="706" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14564" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800" width="800" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14563" height="927" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of fiction, the final Mike Hammer novel <em>Baby, It&#8217;s Murder</em> released recently, and there are upcoming Marvel paperbacks for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Annihilation</em> and <em>Doctor Strange: Dimension Wa</em>r.

I&#8217;m very impressed by what was shown, and have my pre-order in for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. Whilst I like physical media, I can&#8217;t justify that high £74.99 price point for buying <em>Mario Kart</em> separately. Those game prices are the main criticism so far &#8211; the only other hesitation is seeing Nintendo choose surety over innovation in terms of hardware. I&#8217;m confident the Switch 2 will be a huge hit, but I do slightly miss those eclectic reveals of the Wii U, 3DS, Wii, DS, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what I&#8217;m playing, I&#8217;ve been struggling with burnout and game-playing-motivation recently, so haven&#8217;t played much. I have however briefly gotten back into<em> Bravely Default</em> on the DS (which ironically has a Switch 2 version coming soon), and continue to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel </em>now and then. I&#8217;m hoping my game-playing motivation returns soon, but am also not putting too much pressure on myself, as I don&#8217;t want to force it. I look forward to the Switch 2 hopefully reigniting that fire a bit &#8211; oh, and please add Captain Toad to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, Nintendo! It would make me very happy indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve admittedly struggled to get back into games recently &#8211; but when it comes to TV, I&#8217;ve been keeping more up-to-date, and there&#8217;s a lot that I&#8217;ve been liking recently! The second season of <em>Andor </em>and second (or fifteenth, depending on how you count) season of <em>Doctor Who</em> are currently airing, and both are fantastic. <em>Andor </em>continues the engrossing drama and brilliantly tangible visual design of the first season, and this era of <em>Doctor Who</em> is really hitting a stride, with unexpected surprises amidst the brilliantly imaginative stories. I really hope the rumours of <em>Doctor Who</em> taking a break after this season are false, as Ncuti Gatwa is sensational, portraying a charismatic and emotionally healed Doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also just finished watching through <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Netflix-verse of Marvel TV (especially<em> Jessica Jones</em>), so to see some of those characters returning has been wonderful. The series feels like both a reinvention and a continuation of the original three <em>Daredevil </em>seasons, and I&#8217;ve been thrilled by how well it has turned out. The character work, cinematography, and courtroom/political intrigue is all here, and I am stoked for Season 2 &#8211; I just hope some of the Defenders do turn up in Season 2, including not just Jessica Jones, but Luke Cage and Iron Fist too!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a quick rundown on what I&#8217;ve been doing, playing, and watching! I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this quick update &#8211; I think of this site like my own digital journal, so even when I take a break, I always like to come back with some sort of update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really hope you are happy and healthy, and that you are having a wonderful week. See you next time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mikehammer_babyitsmurder_fc.jpg?w=666', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/81tvyzi3mvl._sl1500_.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doctorstrange_dimensionwar_salescover-1.jpg?w=678', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/godzillamovienovelization_omnibus_salescvr_dec24.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}]}

With such an expansive and imaginative open world, it&#8217;s a double-edged sword when it comes to DLC; on one hand, you know people like this world, but on the other, you really have to make the expansion stand out from that world to set it apart. For <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, this is done with a new area named The Cut, full of cold weather, dangerous new machines such as the Scorcher, and intriguing story reveals that bridge the gap between <em>Zero Dawn</em> and the sequel <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/03/30/horizon-forbidden-west-review/">Forbidden West</a></em> (incidentally, the only reason I haven&#8217;t included the <em>Forbidden West</em> DLC on this list is because I don&#8217;t have a PS5 to play it on)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cut is full of activities for main character Aloy, whether it be exploration, narrative, or combat &#8211; including optional super-hard combat trials for the real masochists among us. The local tribe (named the Banuk) tie into the aforementioned overarching story, and as Aloy discovers literal machinations under the snow-covered surface of The Cut, it increased my anticipation around where the sequel will go next &#8211; which is surely a sign of a successful DLC. When I wrote <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/02/14/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds-review/">my review for <em>The Frozen Wilds</em></a> back in 2018, I also noted how it made small steps to improve dialogue animations (which were sometimes quite static in the main game), and you can see how that was continued to full fruition in the dynamic conversations of <em>Forbidden West</em>. Not only is <em>The Frozen Wilds</em> substantial and utterly beautiful to look at, but it actively improves the gameplay foundation of a series I adore.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Mass Effect 3: Leviathan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious choices when it comes to <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC are the fantastic <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> for <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, or the <em>Citadel </em>DLC that served as an epilogue for <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. However, the expansion I have the strongest personal connection to is <em>Leviathan</em>, the first of the <em>Mass Effect 3</em> DLCs. I only bought an Xbox 360 shortly before <em>Mass Effect 3</em> launched, and that game was my gateway into the series (I went back and played the entire trilogy afterwards). After mainly playing on Nintendo consoles beforehand, the concept of single-player expansions was relatively foreign to me &#8211; but after being so enraptured by <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, I was incredibly excited at the prospect of more story content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ending of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is infamous for being disappointing to many people &#8211; but in a way, it made me more excited for DLC that would further flesh out the backstory of the giant world-destroying Reapers that you face throughout the trilogy. <em>Leviathan </em>is all about the discovery of a secret race named (you guessed it) Leviathans, who predate even the mysterious Reapers. In the DLC, you journey across space to piece together morsels of information about their origins. I particularly like the planet 2181 Despoina, a planet covered in water and full of secrets and intense combat situations. That sense of discovering places that were meant to be hidden forever is thrilling, especially when you get to the climactic moments that reveal how the Leviathans play into the wider battle against the Reapers &#8211; and it&#8217;s that rush of energy that makes <em>Leviathan </em>stand out as my favourite <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker &#8211; Special Episode</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very happy when <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> got a Switch release, as it allowed even more people to play this gem of a game &#8211; and I was even happier when in early 2019, a new selection of levels was added with the <em>Special Episode</em> expansion! Whilst this isn&#8217;t a large single-player story expansion like some of the other games I&#8217;ve included in this list, I wanted to highlight this DLC for <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, as it&#8217;s a joyful addition with plenty of value for money (currently £5.39 on Switch). Also, yes, I&#8217;m biased for Captain Toad, but that&#8217;s besides the point, aha&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who haven&#8217;t played <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, it&#8217;s a delightful puzzle game that sees Captain Toad and Toadette make their way through levels based on Hakoniwa Japanese box gardens, with the player rotating and shifting the levels around in order to progress. The <em>Special Episode</em> adds 5 brand new levels and 13 challenges that reinvent previous courses, so 18 new levels to play through in total. As with the main game, there&#8217;s a lovely variety, from haunted caves full of Boos, to a treacherous ship, to another minecart ride! As <em>Treasure Tracker</em> is presented in several book chapters, the DLC additions fit in smoothly, and I&#8217;d frankly happily play as many levels as Nintendo is happy to add (I really hope we get a sequel one day)! The <em>Special Episode</em> is a wonderful and endearing addition to <em>Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Dragon Age: Inquisition &#8211; Trespasser</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a brilliant time with all of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> DLCs, but it&#8217;s the final DLC <em>Trespasser </em>that&#8217;s my favourite of the bunch. Requiring story completion to play, it&#8217;s a definitive end &#8211; and cliffhanger &#8211; to <em>Inquisition</em>, even preventing you from returning to the main game afterwards. The plot brings the player to a summit assembled to decide what happens to the Inquisition now that the main threat has been ended, but soon a new conspiracy is discovered. This eventually reveals that Solas (an eleven mage who&#8217;s a consistent presence in the <em>Dragon Age</em> series) is secretly Fen&#8217;Harel and the Dread Wolf. He&#8217;s been responsible for many of the magical occurrences that have played a part in the game, and he&#8217;s now seeking to collapse the Veil that separates worlds, despite the catastrophic consequences it&#8217;d cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For players who&#8217;ve spent many hours around this character who they thought was on their side, it&#8217;s a dramatic reveal that created a lot of excitement for the sequel to <em>Inquisition</em>. Solas even cuts off the arm of the main character to prevent them stopping him, before disappearing and leaving the player with the decision of whether the Inquisition should be continued or disbanded. <em>Trespasser </em>does have competent combat elements too, but the story is the focus here, and it&#8217;s always been memorable thanks to the anticipation it created for the sequel. However, despite <em>Trespasser </em>releasing in 2015, we only got <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/08/04/dragon-age-the-veilguard-why-im-optimistic-what-id-like-to-see-next/">The Veilguard</a></em> at the end of 2024, so it did leave a lot of time for players to stew and theorize!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Resident Evil 5: Lost in Nightmares/Desperate Escape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I first played <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/02/resident-evil-5-review/">Resident Evil 5</a></em> in 2020, and I did so on PS4, where both the DLC expansions <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> and <em>Desperate Escape</em> are bundled in with the main game, so I&#8217;m going to include them both together for the purposes of this list. Whilst <em>Resident Evil 5</em> certainly has flaws, it also has a lot to praise, such as how it leans into cinematic storytelling. The two DLCs act as a prequel and an in-between-quel, and give an opportunity to play as series mainstay (and <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/23/my-5-favourite-video-game-characters/">my favourite <em>Resident Evil</em> character</a>) Jill Valentine, as well as the pilot Josh Stone. Firstly, <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> is set before <em>Resident Evil 5</em>, and shows Jill and Chris Redfield infiltrating the Spencer estate to confront Albert Wesker. We see snippets of this encounter &#8211; which leaves Jill presumed dead &#8211; during the main game as flashbacks, but here we get to play through it all: puzzles, combat, and Wesker boss fight included. Jill and Chris are the quintessential <em>Resident Evil</em> partners, so it&#8217;s comforting to see them interact (well, as comforting as it can be when facing down monstrosities).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Desperate Escape</em> is set towards the end of the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> campaign, just after Sheva Alomar and Chris manage to free Jill from the mind control of Wesker. Whilst the former pair go after Wesker in the main game, we never got to see how Jill and Josh made their own way out, and we get to play that out for ourselves here. This is arguably the tougher DLC of the two, less puzzle-focused and more about, well, desperately escaping &#8211; ending with a horde-assault sequence that gets frenetic on the higher difficulties. Both DLCs are great for different reasons, and as a combo add a lot to the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> story experience. Jill getting her time to shine is great too, especially as she wasn&#8217;t playable in the main game. This is timeline-wise the last time we got to play as Jill in the main story, too &#8211; please take the hint, Capcom&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The Last of Us: Left Behind</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You knew this had to be on here, right? In my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> rose the bar for story expansions, just like <em>The Last of Us</em> rose the bar for narrative video games. <em>Left Behind</em> fits into the later portions of <em>The Last of Us</em>, after Joel is near-fatally injured, and Ellie is hunting for medical supplies in an abandoned mall. This forms part of Left Behind, but it&#8217;s also interspersed with flashbacks to three weeks before the main game, where Ellie is taken by her friend Riley to break into another abandoned mall in Boston &#8211; and this is where the DLC shines at its brightest. As with many of the other expansions in my list, the core gameplay is a solid continuation of the main game, but it&#8217;s the story advancements and believable character interactions which leave the strongest impact here, giving us brand new information on Elie and her backstory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the best parts of the DLC aren&#8217;t fighting infected, but instead when Riley and Ellie are exploring the desolate mall. They find carousels, video games, and plenty more to play with and talk about. The in-gameplay dialogue that <em>The Last of Us</em> uses so well is continued here, resulting in a moment between the two girls that is both natural and surprising, especially for blockbuster games at the time. It&#8217;s all interwoven with that bittersweet sense that something bad is going to happen &#8211; after all, this is an apocalyptic world, we didn&#8217;t hear much about Riley in the main game, and we know Ellie gets bitten at some point. Those moments do come, but they maintain all their dramatic impact because of the masterful way Naughty Dog combines gameplay and narrative (and also because of brilliant performances by Yaani King as Riley and Ashley Johnson as Ellie). As I said at the start &#8211; in my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> raised the bar for story expansions, and it&#8217;s still one of my favourites to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>With that, we come to the end of the list! As mentioned earlier, there are plenty other great DLC expansions out there, but these are six of my own favourites, each for their own specific reasons.

Therefore, I thought I&#8217;d give a quick overview of what&#8217;s been added to the game and why I&#8217;ve found it so rewarding!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Look to the Skies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s immediately obvious which archetype Konami is pushing with this event &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the Sky Strikers, who were introduced back in 2018 and have become incredibly popular since. The first two <em>Master Duel </em>anniversaries tied into Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so it&#8217;s admittedly a shame we don&#8217;t have a Red-Eyes Black Dragon event to round out the central three <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> Duel Monsters characters of Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey &#8211; but I suppose the power of the fan-favourite Sky Striker characters Raye and Roze was just too strong!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14502" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14515" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14519" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png" width="2560" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop is filled with new items featuring board backgrounds, player mates, card backs, a deck box, and more focused around the Sky Strikers, plus admittedly stunning alternate arts for the main Sky Striker cards. I&#8217;m not an expert on the archetype, but all the amazing artwork and shiny bonuses definitely has me intrigued to learn more about the characters!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of&#8230; The new solo Story is unsurprisingly focused around the Sky Strikers. However, what makes this even more special is the addition of animated sequences within the Sky Striker story, which have been taken from the upcoming anime <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME: THE CHRONICLES</em>. For those who don&#8217;t know, Konami recently announced that this anime will be starting in April 2025, and will be focused on the actual card lore itself. So, instead of revolving around duels (like <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em>, <em>5D&#8217;s</em>, or <em>Arc-V</em> did, for example), <em>CHRONICLES </em>will be set within the world of the cards, which is very exciting! It&#8217;s been announced that these episodes will include the archetypes Fall of Albaz, Dogmatika Ecclesia, and yes &#8211; Sky Strikers!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14505" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14507" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14508" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing small clips of the anime in the <em>Master Duel</em> solo mode was unexpected, and acts as a lovely tease of what&#8217;s to come. The animation is vibrant and expressive, and it&#8217;s great to see this willingness to expand on the card lore &#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely be checking these anime episodes out as they release. Also I have to mention that the new UI for the solo mode is much improved and more player-friendly, segmenting the various solo stories up in a cleaner way, which I appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Festival Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next major addition to <em>Master Duel</em> is the two Festivals that are happening this month &#8211; the first one, Legend Anthology, features a custom banlist that excludes common staples, such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. In theory, this shakes up the meta within the mode, especially with three pre-made decks ready for players to use. However, this mode is dominated by the new Exodia deck and cards, in particular The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate, which can reach upwards of 10000 ATK and can also negates card effects. Often, the match is decided on the coin flip, as if a player goes first and gets out this Exodia card, it&#8217;s extremely hard to the opponent to stage a comeback. Still, the mode has plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, so it&#8217;s worth grinding through.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14511" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14510" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14509" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m much more excited for the upcoming Fusion X Synchro Festival (starting 17th February), which will restrict the Extra Deck to only Synchro/Fusion monsters, and cut out all the options that Link and XYZ monsters have added. I&#8217;m growing to respect those newer card types more over time, but it&#8217;ll still be fun to play some games that make players revert to pre-XYZ strategies. Hopefully it&#8217;ll allow some of my older classic decks to be a bit more viable (at least briefly)! Just like the Legend Anthology, there are plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, which should make it worth the playtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Plenty of Prizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that has always pleasantly surprised me about <em>Master Duel</em> is how generous it is as a Free-to-Play game. The 3rd Anniversary is timed with the start of a new Duel Pass, which is a 700-Gem purchase that &#8211; if you complete it &#8211; earns you all your Gems back, as well as cosmetic and in-game currency rewards, such as a background themed around the aforementioned Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate. If I had to suggest improvements, it would be for a few more unique cosmetic rewards in the Pass &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to complain too much about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the Sky Striker items I mentioned earlier, the shop also has a new Structure Deck full of the expensive HERO cards, new Selection Packs that include those new Exodia cards, as well as another chance to buy previous Anniversary-exclusive items themed around Blue-Eyes White Dragon. As someone who took a long break from <em>Master Duel</em>, I appreciate this a lot, and am slowly working my way through acquiring these.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14517" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14512" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14514" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The deck that&#8217;s currently giving me the most success is my anti-meta Gravekeeper deck, which I&#8217;ve fine-tuned to include more drawing cards and be more reliable (see the decklist image above). I&#8217;ve also finally put together my Destiny HERO deck, which is more meta, and features more Extra Deck combo cards. For long-term success in <em>Master Duel</em>, I need to learn more of these combo plays (and how to combat other combo decks), so I don&#8217;t want to stick with anti-meta decks like Gravekeepers for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my quick summation of the new <em>Master Duel</em> features and how they&#8217;ve positively affected the game &#8211; I&#8217;m really enjoying the amount to do right now, as well as the continued support Konami is bringing. I&#8217;m still slowly re-acclimatising myself to <em>Master Duel</em> after such a long time away, but I&#8217;m continuing to enjoy it and play a few duels every day. If anyone else is intrigued in giving the game a shot, I&#8217;d say now is an ideal time to jump on board, as the game is offering many player-friendly rewards that not only play on nostalgia for <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, but also relate to future projects like the <em>CHRONICLES </em>anime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this quick article &#8211; and if you&#8217;re playing <em>Master Duel</em>, let me know how you&#8217;re finding it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Lothlorien is far more than just golden trees and cheery sunlight; there are floating seeds, lots of fluttering birds darting here and there, and that warm bloom. It&#8217;s a place that feels alive and vibrant and peaceful &#8212; if only it wasn&#8217;t infested with elves. Ah well, not every zone can be perfect.</p>\n<p>This zone is notable for the fact that once you&#8217;re in the Golden Wood proper, there are no typical enemies &#8212; no orcs, goblins, and the like. Any real servants of the enemy. There are beasts to kill, of course, but even half of those are &#8220;protected&#8221; and shouldn&#8217;t be touched.</p>\n<p><a href="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/forest.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65109" height="394" src="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/forest.jpg" width="700" /></a></p>\n<p>Because of the repeatable quests in this zone, it&#8217;s pretty easy to cheeseball the quest deed and not actually go through all of the stories. That&#8217;s my preferred method, because you can hoover up a chunk of dailies that have you go into a single orc camp area and do a bunch of stuff at once. Rinse and repeat that a few times, and the deed is done &#8212; and no flower picking, tree singing (seriously, it&#8217;s a thing with these elves), or sappy love story sagas have to be encountered.</p>\n<p>After that, it was on to the explorer deeds, starting with Lorien Look-out &#8212; a search of all the flets in the forest. Treasure caches aside, I love explorer deeds the most in this game. They&#8217;re relatively quick to do and usually lead you to interesting locations you might not find without prompting.

LOTRO has an interesting relationship with the passage of time, but this is exactly how it should be done.</p>\n<p><a href="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/vale.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65106" height="394" src="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/vale.jpg" width="700" /></a></p>\n<p>I was talking with a kinnie the other night about this more methodical deeding approach to going through the game, and how it really serves to pump the brakes on a players&#8217; &#8220;go, advance, must get to the end&#8221; mentality in favor of really soaking in the zones, seeing the sights, and having a more full sense of completion when all is finished. They thought that sounded pretty cool.</p>\n<p>I alternate between turning world chat on and off. I do like it on when there&#8217;s civil and interesting conversation, which is a good chunk of the time, because it entertains and makes me feel connected to the greater LOTRO community. But when people start bringing out the tension and drama and unnecessary trolling, well, that channel gets switched off in a hurry.</p>\n<p><a href="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anfalas.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65116" height="395" src="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anfalas.jpg" width="700" /></a></p>\n<p>With all of King&#8217;s Gondor Renewed finished up, I moved on to the final piece of pre-Umbar content &#8212; Outer Gondor. I&#8217;ve loved traveling into this region, because it feels so sparse and isolated from civilization, especially Anfalas. You have to travel a good long while on the road before you even come to a settlement, and it&#8217;s not that terribly impressive.</p>\n<p>There are some quietly moving sidequests here, including one where you spend a bit of time with a mother who lost her son to the sea and another one where you reunite a daughter and dad. It&#8217;s all good foreshadowing about how disruptive the corsairs can be.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/2025/10/13/lotro-pushing-into-the-final-frontier/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/836ca23089c8b5bceed0338d9104bf161b5d9aa8a728d9318701ab6af13a8b9a?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=PG', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gondor.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/vale.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anfalas.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

These being Square-Enix productions, they&#8217;d definitely hit that classic feel spot.</li>\n<li><strong>Clair Obscur Expedition 33:</strong> I don&#8217;t know too much about this title other than it&#8217;s a French-styled JRPG (is that a thing?) with glowing reviews and a creative fantasy world.</li>\n<li><strong>KOTOR 2:</strong> I never did beat this. And the last time I played it was back in 2017, so it might be time for a revisit.</li>\n<li><strong>Pillars of Eternity 2 and Avowed:</strong> I absolutely loved the first game yet kept bouncing off this sequel. I might need to push through to get into it past the opening act. If I beat that, I should probably line up Avowed to play, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3:\xa0</strong>Both of these are content-rich acclaimed titles with huge followings. I&#8217;ve only lightly dipped into both. Some day. Some day.</li>\n<li><strong>Rogue Trader:</strong> I was actually having a good time with this, despite the turn-based format. I should restart and give it another go.</li>\n<li><strong>Tyranny:</strong> I own this and only very lightly started it. It&#8217;s one of those titles often mentioned as underrated and overlooked, and that might warrant a more serious look.</li>\n<li><strong>Baldur&#8217;s Gate 2:</strong> I have the enhanced edition and haven&#8217;t played through this since, oh, 2005 or so. I have very fond memories of it, though.</li>\n<li><strong>Hogwarts Legacy:\xa0</strong>I own this but barely played it so far &#8212; my kids have 100% completed it though, they adore it.</li>\n<li><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2:</strong> Heard so many great things about this, I might snag it next time it goes on sale.</li>\n<li>Also&#8230; <strong>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</strong>?</li>\n</ol>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/2025/10/06/10-jrpgs-and-crpgs-im-lining-up-to-play/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/836ca23089c8b5bceed0338d9104bf161b5d9aa8a728d9318701ab6af13a8b9a?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=PG', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/chained-echoes.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Today, we\'re mixing up a "Tales" with a CodeSOD.</p>\n<p>Today\'s Anonymous submitter does tech screens at their company. Like most companies do, they give the candidate a simple toy problem, and ask them to solve it. The goal here is not to get the greatest code, but as our submitter puts it, "weed out the jokers".</p>\n<p>Now our submitter didn\'t tell us what the problem was, but I don\'t have to know what the problem was to understand that this is wrong:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-c">    <span class="hljs-type">int</span> temp1=i, temp2=j;\n    <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(temp1&lt;n&amp;&amp;temp2&lt;n&amp;&amp;board[temp1][temp2]==board[i][j]){\n         <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(temp1+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>&gt;=n||temp1+<span class="hljs-number">2</span>&gt;=n)\n            <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;\n         <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(board[temp1][temp2]==board[temp1][temp2+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]==board[temp1][temp2+<span class="hljs-number">2</span>])\n           points++;\n         ele\n           <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>; \n         temp2++;\n      }\n</code></pre>\n<p>As what is, in essence, a whiteboard coding exercise, I\'m not going to mark off for the typo on <code>ele</code> (instead of <code>else</code>). But there\'s still plenty "what were you thinking" here.</p>\n<p>From what I can get just from reading the code, I think they\'re trying to play tic-tac-toe. I\'m guessing, but that they check three values in a column makes me think it\'s tic-tac-toe. Maybe some abstracted version, where the board is larger than 3x3 but you can score based on any run of length 3?</p>\n<p>So we start by setting <code>temp1</code> and <code>temp2</code> equal to <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>. Then our while loop checks: are <code>temp1</code> and <code>temp2</code> still on the board, and does the square pointed at by them equal the square pointed at by <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>.</p>\n<p>At the start of our loop, we have a second check, which is testing for a read-ahead; ensuring that our next check doesn\'t fall off the boundaries of the array. Notably, the <code>temp1</code> part of the check isn\'t really used- they never finished handling the diagonals, and instead are only checking the vertical column on the next. Similarly, <code>temp2</code> is the only thing incremented in the loop, never <code>temp1</code>.</p>\n<p>All in all, it\'s a mess, and no, the candidate did not receive an offer. What we\'re left with is some perplexing and odd code.</p>\n<p>I know this is verging into soapbox territory, but I want to have a talk about how to make tech screens better for everyone. These are things to keep in mind if you are administering one, or suffering through one.</p>\n<p>The purpose of a tech screen is to inspire conversation. As a candidate, you need to talk through your thought process. Yes, this is a difficult skill that isn\'t directly related to your day-to-day work, but it\'s still a <em>useful</em> skill to have. For the screener, <em>get them talking</em>. Ask questions, pause them, try and take their temperature. You\'re in this together, talk about it.</p>\n<p>The screen should also be an opportunity to make mistakes and go down the wrong path. As the candidate\'s understanding of the problem develops, they\'ll likely need to go backwards and retrace some steps. That\'s good! As a candidate, you want to do that. Be gracious and comfortable with your mistakes, and write code that\'s easy to fix because you\'ll need to. As a screener, you should similarly be gracious about their mistakes. This is not a place for gotchas or traps.</p>\n<p>Finally, <em>don\'t</em> treat the screen as an "opportunity to weed out jokers".

Today, we\'re mixing up a "Tales" with a CodeSOD.</p>\n<p>Today\'s Anonymous submitter does tech screens at their company. Like most companies do, they give the candidate a simple toy problem, and ask them to solve it. The goal here is not to get the greatest code, but as our submitter puts it, "weed out the jokers".</p>\n<p>Now our submitter didn\'t tell us what the problem was, but I don\'t have to know what the problem was to understand that this is wrong:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-c">    <span class="hljs-type">int</span> temp1=i, temp2=j;\n    <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(temp1&lt;n&amp;&amp;temp2&lt;n&amp;&amp;board[temp1][temp2]==board[i][j]){\n         <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(temp1+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>&gt;=n||temp1+<span class="hljs-number">2</span>&gt;=n)\n            <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;\n         <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(board[temp1][temp2]==board[temp1][temp2+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]==board[temp1][temp2+<span class="hljs-number">2</span>])\n           points++;\n         ele\n           <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>; \n         temp2++;\n      }\n</code></pre>\n<p>As what is, in essence, a whiteboard coding exercise, I\'m not going to mark off for the typo on <code>ele</code> (instead of <code>else</code>). But there\'s still plenty "what were you thinking" here.</p>\n<p>From what I can get just from reading the code, I think they\'re trying to play tic-tac-toe. I\'m guessing, but that they check three values in a column makes me think it\'s tic-tac-toe. Maybe some abstracted version, where the board is larger than 3x3 but you can score based on any run of length 3?</p>\n<p>So we start by setting <code>temp1</code> and <code>temp2</code> equal to <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>. Then our while loop checks: are <code>temp1</code> and <code>temp2</code> still on the board, and does the square pointed at by them equal the square pointed at by <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>.</p>\n<p>At the start of our loop, we have a second check, which is testing for a read-ahead; ensuring that our next check doesn\'t fall off the boundaries of the array. Notably, the <code>temp1</code> part of the check isn\'t really used- they never finished handling the diagonals, and instead are only checking the vertical column on the next. Similarly, <code>temp2</code> is the only thing incremented in the loop, never <code>temp1</code>.</p>\n<p>All in all, it\'s a mess, and no, the candidate did not receive an offer. What we\'re left with is some perplexing and odd code.</p>\n<p>I know this is verging into soapbox territory, but I want to have a talk about how to make tech screens better for everyone. These are things to keep in mind if you are administering one, or suffering through one.</p>\n<p>The purpose of a tech screen is to inspire conversation. As a candidate, you need to talk through your thought process. Yes, this is a difficult skill that isn\'t directly related to your day-to-day work, but it\'s still a <em>useful</em> skill to have. For the screener, <em>get them talking</em>. Ask questions, pause them, try and take their temperature. You\'re in this together, talk about it.</p>\n<p>The screen should also be an opportunity to make mistakes and go down the wrong path. As the candidate\'s understanding of the problem develops, they\'ll likely need to go backwards and retrace some steps. That\'s good! As a candidate, you want to do that. Be gracious and comfortable with your mistakes, and write code that\'s easy to fix because you\'ll need to. As a screener, you should similarly be gracious about their mistakes. This is not a place for gotchas or traps.</p>\n<p>Finally, <em>don\'t</em> treat the screen as an "opportunity to weed out jokers". It\'s so tempting, and yes, we\'ve all had screens with obviously unqualified candidates. It sucks for everybody. But if you\'re in the position to do a screen, I want to tell you one mindset hack that will make you a better interviewer: you are not trying to filter out candidates, you are gathering evidence to make the best case for <em>this</em> candidate.</p>\n<p>Your goal, in administering a technical screen, is to gather enough evidence that you can advocate for this candidate.

I am a proud member and one of the founders of one such organization, Alpha Omega Mu. Founded in 2007, AΩM has been a passion of mine off and on throughout the years. AΩM has deep roots in honoring the Divine Nine, a collection of African American sororities and fraternities that started in the United States in the 1800s, and our focus on charity is a core part of who we are. For 18 years, we have raised funds for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and have also contributed to other organizations’ charity drives. Since returning to Second Life three years ago, I’ve spent much of my time focused on growing a strong and thriving sisterhood. This year has come with growing pains, but we’ve shifted our focus and are aiming to put roleplay at the forefront of our organization.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">There is a thriving Greek Letter community in Second Life, and while I sometimes take issue with the wider community (a blog post for another day), I am often amazed by the ingenuity and creativity you can find within it. This past week really brought that home for me, as my organization helped fellow Greeks Kappa Theta Phi II with their fall vacation event, Chalet Valdoro Fall Festival. The week-long event focused on smaller roleplay activities, from wine tasting and horseback riding (which AΩM hosted) to scuba diving, karaoke, and even an actual horse derby. Each event gave participants the opportunity to get to know one another, crack a few jokes, and unwind. It offered everyone a chance to step away from the hustle and bustle of the real world and experience, in essence, a vacation they might not be able to afford or find time for otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/ac1c726a-3811-4cde-b158-0189d9358510/Valdoro+Air.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">It also gave me the chance to remember why my first foray into online gaming was virtual worlds and making connections. Over time, I have become less and less social. I\'ve always been shy, but over the last few years, I\'ve somewhat become a hermit. I stick to my group and only my group, rarely venturing into new experiences and heavily vetting anyone I deal with. And yes, when you think sorority, you think social butterflies, so I know there is a weird juxtaposition there, which is why this week has been huge for me. During our wine tasting event, we tried something new for AΩM with a “Hot Ones” style segment inspired by the YouTube series, and everyone loved it. Three other organizations have already said they want to join in next time since we plan to film future sessions and share them on social media. As a matter of fact, I spent much of this morning joking around with some of the other people staying at the resort on the dedicated Discord server. We\'ve talked about collaborating on another vacation event and working together on our upcoming charity drives. There has been a real building of community this week that reminds me it\'s okay to step outside your comfort zone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/3797d40c-f54d-456d-84f7-61288e34d897/Hot+Ones.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/8be48f08-8149-44b3-805e-a1ac80cf61c8/Brunch+Time.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/f3400f94-6f3d-46b2-9d7d-1f6475bdf87d/Crystal+Cave.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">Second Life is full of subcultures most people never see, and Greek life is one of its most enduring and creative. What this week reminded me is that behind every avatar, there’s a person looking for connection, laughter, and belonging. The bonds we build through roleplay might start as stories, but over time they become something very real. If you\'re curious about how organizations like Alpha Omega Mu operate, or want to learn more about Greek roleplay in Second Life, let me know in the comments. I’d love to share more about this side of the world in a future post.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1760050772090-M0870QX6B7U66AZ99ZXZ/Off+to+Italy.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

As we looked out over the bay, I was struck by two things: how vast this world is, and how I ended up here with these two men. They call me a friend, and I am still in awe of them. To listen to them honor one another was humbling. Though tonight their words were not meant for me, but for each other, I felt them all the same. The struggle to live up to what once was, to what others believe we should be, is a battle I know all too well.</p><p class="">Eight years of war have carried me to this place. The Broken Isles, Zandalar and Kul Tiras, the otherworldly Shadowlands, and the Dragon Isles. One battleground after another, each demanding more of me, more of us, but each leaving scars unique to the person. For me, there was no pause, no moment to breathe until now. Listening to Thrall and Anduin, I realize that in war, none of us walk free of the dead. We simply learn to live beside them.</p><p class="">For the first time I can feel the calm before the storm. There is a charge in the air, but the wind that carries it is gentle and warm. I do not know how long it will last. I wish it would last forever. I know it is foolish to think the fighting is over. Even when the battlefield falls silent, the war never truly ends. But in this quiet, I find myself yearning. Yearning to understand how I, a simple Farstrider from Quel’Thalas, ended up here. What was the moment? What was the choice?</p><p class="">And yet, it is silly of me to even ask those questions. I know the answer. I might be too afraid to speak them aloud, but I know them. Perhaps during this in-between, I should read some of my old journals, to look back with some perspective. They do say time helps to round out the edges. So maybe, in reading my journals, I can be gentler with my choices, and if not that, then maybe just gentler with myself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=""><em>Author’s Note:</em><br />This marks the start of Zanaia’s story. A quiet pause before she begins looking back on the choices that shaped her. This first journal entry takes place at the end of <em>The War Within</em> max-level campaign. The remaining journal entries will unfold alongside my playthrough of <em>Legion Remix,</em> tracing her path and the choices she made. For now, the plan is to write her story through <em>Legion.</em> After that, only time will tell.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/jpeg', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759708284120-B7JO818AWEK481F9PBKJ/Zanaia+Anduin+and+Thrall.jpg?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '1500', 'height': '844'}]}

And honestly? That feels amazing. Fun escapism is on the horizon, and I’m here for it.</p><h4>Legion Remix</h4><p class="">Aside from the power-leveling of alts and awesome rewards, I have a feeling there are a few reasons why this is one of the expansions they decided to remix. From what I understand, Legion was one of the more popular expansions, but the end of the expansion also has strong lore ties to what is going on currently. I feel like they want us to go back for the story, or at least I want to go back for the story, and I’m just hoping they want us to as well.</p><p class="">I also think this ties into why they did the Mists of Pandaria remix, which I unfortunately missed. After watching episode 5 of a lore and history series on YouTube, <em>Before the Mists: What was Pandaria really like?</em> from Quaylin, I’ve been thinking a lot about the Thunder King and all the lore and history in Pandaria. (Also, highly recommend that series if you like lore: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEyTJ3_GpaHRKIZ31190_-OuxCTfCafXZ&amp;si=b-EWYQynXZojo_0O" target="_blank">Quaylin’s Playlist</a>).</p><p class="">On top of that, I want to create a short story that might turn into something longer for a character I’ve had in the back of my mind. Most, if not all, of my WoW characters have a backstory, but there’s one story in particular I want to play around with. I’m hoping it’ll help get me back into writing creatively and also make me a better writer. You know, the whole “practice makes perfect” thing. The first in that series is coming out next week, and I’m pretty excited about it.</p><h4>Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity</h4><p class="">As most of my friends know, I adore Guild Wars 2. It has such rich and deep lore, plus it does a really great job of giving you the story via your hero panel if you’ve been away awhile and forgotten what you were up to. Kind of like a gaming bookmark. On top of that, the game is visually stunning, and they just do a lot of things well that I feel some games (<em>cough</em> World of Warcraft <em>cough</em>) take and use for their own. Warbands, I’m looking at you.</p><p class="">I also recently got some new friends into the game. It’s such a delight seeing new players enjoy Guild Wars 2. At first, one of my friends was like, <em>“Oh, I’ll play when you’re on.”</em> Then the next thing I know, they went out and started exploring on their own. I was so proud of them! They’re gamers, but MMOs haven’t really been their thing before. Sadly, Lost Ark was their first MMO, and I was like, <em>“Girl, that is not a game you want to start with.”</em></p><p class="">And of course, the Halloween event is right around the corner. In real life, I’m not the hugest Halloween fan, but there’s something about the Guild Wars 2 version that brings me so much joy. It’s campy and lighthearted, with just the right touch of spooky and decoration. It’s always a good time, and I’m really looking forward to experiencing it with my friends.</p><h4>Dispatch &amp; Anno 117</h4><p class="">I’m looking forward to Dispatch and Anno 117 for different but also similar reasons. They’re both the kinds of games I love to sink into when I’m feeling socially overwhelmed and want to game without any pressure.</p><p class=""><strong>Anno 117</strong> is a city builder (my absolute favorite genre) that will take us to the Roman Empire this time around. I can’t wait to experiment with creating a city that not only functions well but also looks beautiful.</p><p class=""><strong>Dispatch</strong>, on the other hand, is a story-driven, choices-matter RPG with a superhero twist. It features an incredible cast of actors, including two of my favorites from the voice acting world, Travis Willingham and Laura Bailey, as well as Jeffrey Wright. I LOVE Jeffrey Wright.</p><p class="">Both games are ones I know I’ll enjoy for months and months: replaying Dispatch to explore different choices, and perfecting the greatest city I can in Anno.</p><h4>WoW Player Housing</h4><p class="">I cannot even contain my excitement for player housing coming to WoW. I love to decorate in any game that lets me, which is why I adore city builders. Decorating scratches a creative itch for me since I can’t really do that in real life. HGTV is one of my all-time favorite channels, and I’ve basically been using games as my own personal HGTV show ever since The Sims 1 released.</p><p class="">The controls for decorating in WoW also look really similar to Second Life, which I have a lot of experience with. I even have an interior design business in SL, so I know I’ll be able to pull off some pretty amazing things. Once December 2nd rolls around, I’m going to be knee-deep in not only decorating my house but also leveling up the renown for it so I can have <em>all the things</em>!</p><p class="">I also plan to showcase myself decorating and the whole process that goes into it. That should be a lot of fun, kind of like a virtual MMO version of HGTV. Maybe that’ll be the moment I give YouTube another try… probably not, but at the very least I have this space to share all my design ideas.</p><h4>Countdown to Cozy Chaos</h4><p class="">So that is everything on the horizon until the end of the year. I haven’t had this much gaming content to bring me joy in such a long time. It’s hard not to be overwhelmed, but also it feels like being a kid waiting for their birthday or Christmas. Which is ironic because both my birthday and Christmas will be in the middle of all these things.</p><p class="">So if you need me between now and the holidays, you’ll find me happily lost in one of these worlds. Much excite, indeed.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759370554986-2X8R5BJOO4FD5A3AAJ7H/Much+Excite.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

To say I’ve blogged in the past would be an understatement. I’ve had several, all short lived, so we’ll see how this goes. Lately the quick bursts I toss on Mastodon don’t feel like enough. “But blogging? That’s so old school,” I hear you say. Yes, a blog. I know it’s 2025, but I don’t want to stream. Making YouTube videos isn’t on the table for now. So here we are. Fingers to keyboard, thoughts to screen.</p><p class="">So what is this place? Exactly what it says on the tin: a blog. A spot to pull together the ways I play, explore, and create in games. Sometimes that means roleplay stories where characters start writing themselves. Other times it’s screenshots that capture moments I want to hold onto. And sometimes it’s just me reflecting on the gaming experience, the joy, the chaos, the little obsessions of whatever I’m into that week.</p><p class="">My gaming tastes are all over the map, and that’s how I like it. One day I’m chasing achievements in Guild Wars 2. The next I’m running delves in World of Warcraft. Or desperately trying to keep the tiny people in Frostpunk from freezing to death. If it’s a world worth exploring or a puzzle worth figuring out, odds are I’ll end up there.</p><p class="">Ready Pixel One isn’t about guides or dissecting patch notes. It’s about what happens inside the games and inside my head while I play them. It’s the spark of a new MMO story, the random character I get too attached to, the screenshots I can’t stop taking. A mix of RP stories, personal reflections, and snapshots from the journey.</p><p class="">This first post is just me setting the stage. There’s more to come, characters to meet, worlds to visit, and plenty of pixels to share along the way.</p><p class="">So… Pixel One has joined the game.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759292672837-C734CUZR5FF3N0TH5AYW/Ready+Pixel+One.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

Work? I don&#8217;t wanna get up. Mowing my yard? God, I just don&#8217;t <strong>want </strong>to do it. Making dinner? Man, that&#8217;s so much effort. But like, once I&#8217;m actually started, actually in it, I&#8217;m fine. I can work through the lack of motivation, plow through to the end of whatever task I&#8217;m on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take for example this past Saturday, driving up to my dad&#8217;s hometown to buy pizza for his (early) birthday dinner. It&#8217;s a two-plus hour drive, and I&#8217;d been conscripted into doing the drive up so that I&#8217;d know how to do it in the future, know how to get to his old stomping grounds, yadda, yadda. I wanted to go, but I wasn&#8217;t necessarily up for doing the driving. But once I was in the car, on the highway, I enjoyed it. I made the drive with little issue, got myself into the busiest part of town, and to the specific pizza shop he wants when we&#8217;re up there. My mom drove back partially because it was all she could do to <strong>not </strong>drive, and we would be going a way I had almost no experience with because of road construction. It was a nice trip back, saw a bunch of small towns I loved the look of, a bunch of sights I otherwise wouldn&#8217;t had I just stayed home and stared at my computer, you know, the usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or mowing my yard yesterday, I spent all morning dreading actually doing it, then once I was out there, I blew through a solid half of my part of the yard in one go. My brother relieved me to do his sections, then I tore through the rest with no issue after I tagged back in. I spent Saturday night in a state of &#8220;damnit, I don&#8217;t wanna do this&#8221; as I tried to sleep, but once I started, it wasn&#8217;t that bad. Both of it, and the painting we did this weekend, look pretty good if I say so myself. Front door looks nice, front room is done (save for one wall), the yard looks cleaned up for the year, it was worth the hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>But my biggest problem with anything I do, is just starting it. I have a ton of games that I want to play, pieces I want to write, maybe streaming again, but my biggest hurdle is making myself get started on any of those things. The Witcher 3 is high on my list of games to play, but I look at it on my Steam list, look at the install, remember the what felt like years to get let loose in the world, and my urge to play it dries up like the desert. To the point where I just load up one of the few games I do play, and do things that don&#8217;t involve any kind of massive time investment or mental bandwidth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, I talk a big game about how me and 16-year-old me would butt hears about getting started, but 34-year-old me is only better at getting in gear for the things he <strong>has</strong> to get up for. Work? Yeah, I got bills to pay, let&#8217;s get up and go. The things I actually <strong>want</strong> (or really should) do, like playing a game, or mowing my yard (or installing these windows&#8230;), &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna, I just want to zone out for a while&#8221;. And it infuriates me because I know that I&#8217;m just wasting daylight sitting and doing nothing, but nothing sounds like a good thing to do after doing something all day at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the toll that work is putting on me, but recently, the very idea of <strong>doing anything</strong> has made me miserable. Calls are up, clients are especially irritable, and the plates refuse to stop spinning for even one day. And by the time I&#8217;m settled in for the night, my mind is too torched to even consider starting up something else to balance and wedge into my day. Because the last thing I want to do is spend an hour watching a game before I can even move my guy around. If I wanted to do that, I&#8217;d just load up FFXIV and try to slog through the MSQ and Wuk Lamat&#8217;s overwhelming presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Like, right now the idea of writing doesn&#8217;t sound like climbing Everest ten times in a row, because I&#8217;m already in it. But when I build my spaceships in something like No Man&#8217;s Sky and think &#8220;man I want to write about how much fun I&#8217;m having building spaceships&#8221;, it feels like I&#8217;m climbing a mountain with no arms or legs. &#8220;I want to, but that sounds exhausting and I just wanna sleep&#8221; is usually the best excuse I give myself. And I hate it. I really do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how to fix this, other than follow my own dogma of &#8220;the only thing stopping you is you&#8221; when my brother gripes about not starting something himself. Maybe I should take my own advice and realize that the only thing stopping me from starting, is me. I installed X4 and Empyrion earlier today, and I want to at least try one of these games, like I had to make myself do with Space Engineers, whether I like any of them or not, and now I have no excuse as to why I haven&#8217;t. The games are there and ready to roll whenever, it&#8217;s on me to follow through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I start, I&#8217;ll be fine, I&#8217;ll enjoy whatever it is that I&#8217;m doing, that drive home wouldn&#8217;t have been nearly as interesting if we took the same route and had to fight traffic, but the prospect of doing something not even new, but starting something at exhausting to me. It shouldn&#8217;t be, but, it is. And until I can get myself past whatever hang up I have about doing the stuff on my lists of want-and-need-to-do-s, I&#8217;ll just sit in a numb haze repeating the same day five times in a row. I don&#8217;t want that, I want to actually try and start new things instead of being stuck on the few things I don&#8217;t have to think about to placate myself.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/10/06/10-6-2025-the-only-thing-stopping-you-is-you/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_2034.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_2034.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

What got on my mind was the even-further ingrained into my head idea that the more I slow down and not try to overdo things, the better my results are. Now, this is a battle I constantly have to have with myself, but, it&#8217;s one that I probably <strong>need</strong> to keep having. But, try explaining that to my subconscious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, a few weeks back now, I was cranking out the 110 ranks I needed to complete the Season/Expansion/wtf-ever Pass in Destiny 2. With the final ten ranks requiring five-times the experience per-level needed to get a level from 1-100, I was trying everything I could. I ground out missions, strikes, Solo Ops, anything that would knock out these Seasonal Challenges to get me further along the pass. I did so many that I ran out of Challenges to complete that didn&#8217;t involve getting a pick-up group to run Dungeons or Raids, which meant&#8230;Crucible. PvP, player versus player. The bane of my existence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a couple of Challenges I was zeroing in on, Scout Rifle and Solar kills particularly. So, I opted to do both at once, enter Polaris Lance, a Solar Scout that needs you hit your shots consistently to get use out of it. And do you, dear listener, know what I did? I hung back, I hit those shots, and I won more games than I lost in that run. I finished the Pass with two days to spare, got my cosmetics, and got the hell out of dodge. &#8220;Ash &amp; Iron&#8221; is trash, thus, I haven&#8217;t played since it dropped, and I haven&#8217;t bought the pass. But, passes kind of sort of don&#8217;t expire now, so my mad rush to finish them isn&#8217;t necessary any longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>But to go back to me in the Crucible, I played against every impulse I had to run ahead, to feed kills and Super energy to my opponents, and because of that, when my teams lost, it was close in every game but one. I hung back, I stayed glued to my teammates, I didn&#8217;t make any unreasonable, risky pushes to take Zones or chase down a kill. Which, is something I should be doing in general, with everything I do. Push when I know that I can get away with it, rather than push because it&#8217;s a day ending in -Y.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had games where <strong>I </strong>topped the scoreboard for my team, me, who can&#8217;t keep a K/D/R over 0.7 the majority of the time in whatever competitive game I play. I wasn&#8217;t trying to swipe kills from my team, I was hanging back to make sure I landed my shots, and didn&#8217;t feed the other team. Sure, I didn&#8217;t get the number of kills I&#8217;d have liked, but the assists still stacked up, I grabbed kills where I could, and wound up knocking out a couple more PvP challenges than I&#8217;d anticipated to, in far less time than I&#8217;d thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I would normally run in with an auto or SMG, instead, I was hanging back, making sure I stayed with at least one teammate instead of going solo, and using the cover in each area. If I saw an enemy, I didn&#8217;t immediately engage without an exit plan, I played like I was on a team, instead of being an island unto myself. Doing that let me win duels, being one bullet ahead instead of a bullet behind, it even let me come out of a couple 2v1 fights alive where normally I&#8217;d get swallowed whole. Even being down a player, and going 6v5 didn&#8217;t rattle me like I normally would get, because I stuck to the plan I made for myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>See, I typically get incredibly stressed out in PvP, which leads to me feeding the other team, and occupying a permanent place at the bottom of a leaderboard. I tense up when I encounter an enemy, get shaky, and nervous about every duel I wind up in. What I did was bite down on my tongue each time I started to get that nervous feeling and shaky when I got into a fight. It isn&#8217;t a &#8220;healthy&#8221; response, but, it did keep my mind from spiraling as I played each match. That, and putting something on to mindlessly listen to while I played didn&#8217;t hurt either, I could zone out and just focus on what was in front of me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that kept me from overthinking, over analyzing, just twisting myself into knots to the point where I couldn&#8217;t be effective. Which is what normally happens when I get myself stressed out, I become so shaky and nervous that I make every mistake in the book trying to hold together. When I&#8217;d died, between respawns I&#8217;d make myself take a deep breath, recenter myself, and try to get back to a teammate when I got back in. Doing that, I could get the jump on the enemy, instead of getting double-teamed myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing my rank go up in PvP, seeing my name not at the bottom of the board, it was pretty cool. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m going to do <strong>often</strong>, but to finish out a Pass, I&#8217;ll go slam my head on a wall for a bit. As long as I don&#8217;t play outright stupidly, I can hold serve long enough to get where I need to be, get my time in the mines over with as quickly as I can. As long as I can keep a hold of myself, not let myself get too overwhelmed by the task, I know I&#8217;m decent enough to not feel like I&#8217;m getting lapped by every player, just most of them.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/09/21/9-21-2025-play-smarter-not-harder/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_2033.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_2033.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

But, it&#8217;s <strong>mine</strong>.&#8221;? Because that&#8217;s what went through my head recently with a project I&#8217;ve been hammering at. It sucks, it looks like crap, but it&#8217;s my heap of junk and I&#8217;ll be damned if anyone says anything about it. I know it isn&#8217;t perfect! I know it&#8217;s not &#8220;good&#8221;, but damnit I built this thing and I&#8217;ll make it good later!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahem. So, I&#8217;ve been playing a lot of No Man&#8217;s Sky since the Voyager update, where you can now build your own &#8220;Corvette&#8221; class ship to fly around in, and walk around in like it&#8217;s your own portable base. Last night, I finally worked up the money to buy all the parts I need to make me a Corvette, because I don&#8217;t know how the Expedition system works, and I&#8217;ve been too sick to give a damn about how to go about it and get a free Corvette (seriously, I feel like crap. Send help. Or more DayQuil and NyQuil.). Mine&#8230;is not great. It has the bare minimum of what you need to make it flight-worthy, and it shows. It&#8217;s a clunky, ugly mess that will get me from Points A to B, and not much else. But, it&#8217;s <strong>mine</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have hauled junked ships to Stations to scrap them, I have scrambled for my life from Sentinels as the game turns into Ace Combat 04 in space, all in the name of building my own ship. And I finally got it done around 11pm last night, flew it into a planet, and am seeing the good and the bad of it. The good, I have what amounts to a Pelican from Halo. The bad, the landing gear makes it ugly as sin, and I have this thing super vulnerable with the reactor being a massive target. It&#8217;s also very cramped inside, just enough room to jump out of the flight seat, and run around the hold while I&#8217;m on autopilot. When the Sentinels came on the planet I hit, I closed the hatch and looked out the cockpit. &#8220;At least I&#8217;m safe inside my mind&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like making something is a point of pride for me. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s in a game, or real life, that stuff is fulfilling to me. I still have two windows in my house to fix before winter, and if I ever get off my back to do it, I&#8217;ll be super satisfied with my work. Will it be &#8220;pretty&#8221;? No, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. It just has to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I can always reconfigure the Corvette later once I have access to better components. I just wanted to get one of my own built while the drive to play the game is still there. I have some things to trick it out with, but, not as many as I&#8217;d like, nor the experience with the system to really experiment with it. It makes me happy, and that&#8217;s really all I can ask for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ordered takeout tonight, and while it&#8217;s good, it just doesn&#8217;t have the same impact for me as the meals I cooked over the weekend did. My family still isn&#8217;t feeling great, and it was 4pm before the thought of making dinner finally sprang forty because work was busy. I don&#8217;t exactly feel proud of spending $30 on takeout, when if I <strong>really </strong>wanted to, I could have come up with something myself. It just &#8220;is&#8221; rather than is a dish that I can hang my hat on and say &#8220;yeah, <strong>I </strong>made that. I don&#8217;t care if you didn&#8217;t like it, I&#8217;m proud of myself for making it.&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>When I pick up the game again, I&#8217;ll still be going towards the center of the galaxy, but, I also want to keep amassing parts to make my ship my own. Sure, I have a Freighter, I have a (tiny) base, and I have my starting ship, but I want to make my stuff truly my own. Like with my little Corvette-class. It&#8217;s Spartan right now, but, I can make it fancy if I want to. I can make it to my very own liking if it so suits me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the point of it, though, that makes it &#8220;worth it&#8221; to me. That I took these disparate pieces and smashed something together that sure, someone else <strong>could </strong>have done for me, but, was more intrinsically valuable to me by doing it myself. I have projects in real life that yes, I need to hire someone to do, and that&#8217;s fine. But the ones that I can fix myself? Those are the ones that mean the most to me overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could have done the legwork to do the Expedition and get a &#8220;free&#8221; Corvette ship, but, that&#8217;s not as satisfying to me. When the handyman gets up here to fix a leaky toilet, it&#8217;s not necessarily the most satisfying fix, but, only because it&#8217;s a battle I don&#8217;t have the time or the know how to <strong>keep </strong>fixed. Fixing my windows? I can swing that. I don&#8217;t need specialized tools, I just have to do it. Same with building up Relics, or bases, or ships. I just have to do it.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/09/15/9-15-2025-it-sucks-but-its-mine/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/static-assets-upload9467594363923905941.png'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/static-assets-upload9467594363923905941.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

It isn&#8217;t, but, that feeling doesn&#8217;t ever go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I live (around Cincinnati), one of the local radio stations has a big fireworks show on the Ohio River on the night before Labor Day, that gets shown on one of the local tv stations each year on a rotating basis. It&#8217;s kind of a farewell to the season, a way to celebrate one last time before &#8220;real life&#8221; starts back up in earnest. And with it being literally at the end of August this year, the end of the Blaugust event, it has me wistful and wishing the summer never ended. Kind of like how I felt as a kid, when the fireworks felt like summer ended, even though I&#8217;d been back at a school for a week or two at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mowed my yard for what will probably be the last time this year, and while it was easier than it had been all season, it felt sad to do, because it&#8217;s the tail end of doing it until the spring. I can feel the days getting shorter, the weather has been cooler than before, and in my mind, it feels like time slipping away. It hasn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve been plenty busy this summer, I&#8217;ve done plenty of things, made changes I needed to make, it&#8217;s not like I haven&#8217;t done anything. But in my mind, I don&#8217;t want the season to end on me, I don&#8217;t want Blaugust to end, I don&#8217;t want the calendar to flip over tonight. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll say that I hate the summer, that winter is my favorite season, but I don&#8217;t <strong>really </strong>hate it. I don&#8217;t like the heat, I don&#8217;t like that my beleaguered baseball team is absolute dog water every year, the things I can&#8217;t control. I miss it when it&#8217;s gone, and don&#8217;t really appreciate it while it&#8217;s here like I should. Especially when it&#8217;s hitting zero on the thermometer, and I&#8217;m freezing to death even with the heaters roaring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer is freedom to me, even though I&#8217;ve been &#8220;free&#8221; for years now, with the exception of my job. It&#8217;s meant that I can spend that time doing what I want to do, going where I want to go, even though I can just <strong>do </strong>that whenever now. It&#8217;s meant that I don&#8217;t have to coop up in this house, that I can grab the car keys and go somewhere like I did yesterday. It&#8217;s probably a holdover from my childhood, but, what isn&#8217;t at this point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230;I should really just use my PTO and realize that there&#8217;s three other seasons, and that just because it&#8217;s colder/freezing/not as warm, that I can just go do things without waiting for the calendar to say June/July/August. Just because summer is ending, it doesn&#8217;t mean that I can&#8217;t just take some time and go do something that interests me. It isn&#8217;t like I can&#8217;t just jump into the car at 5pm on a cold January evening and drive around for an hour because it &#8220;isn&#8217;t the right months&#8221;. Or take a trip to the city and go shopping for something I&#8217;ve wanted and don&#8217;t want to order online. I don&#8217;t <strong>have </strong>to be responsible <strong>all the time</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Because in my mind, those other seasons? Those are when I have to be &#8220;responsible&#8221;, have to be buttoned up and an adult, while in the summer, I can screw around and get weird with it. Which hasn&#8217;t been the case for a long time, since my &#8220;responsible&#8221; time is &#8220;between the hours of 7am-4pm, Monday-Friday&#8221;, and all through the year. After that, I can be a screwball weirdo all I want, as long as I&#8217;m not hurting anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with Blaugust, it feels like it&#8217;s my chance to get really experimental with how I write, even though there&#8217;s no rule book <strong>to</strong> writing like this. I can get weird all year! Why am I stocking up my stream-of-consciousness yapping to burn on one month, instead of just doing weird shit whenever I want? It&#8217;s not like the Blog Gods are going to come down and smite me for writing about baseball in January!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That freedom to go off the map is there all year, and I need to learn how to just run with it. That &#8220;summer vacation&#8221; for me is just a state of mind, not a reality I have to live with any longer. That fireworks show tonight will be the &#8220;unofficial&#8221; end of summer, but that summer doesn&#8217;t have to end for me. I can make it last forever in my mind if I want to, I don&#8217;t have to let that freedom go just because the calendar and the leaves change.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/31/blaugust2025-day-31-end-of-the-line/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_1751-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_1751-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

A rematch from the semifinals in last year&#8217;s Playoff, the marquee game of the opening weekend, yadda, yadda, yadda. I didn&#8217;t watch it. Not because I don&#8217;t care about my Buckeyes, but, because I knew that I could not handle the stress of it. I know how I am, and you could door me up on happy pills until the cows came home, they would not touch that kind of anxiety that comes from this team that I put way too much of my mental health into every autumn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We won, by the way. 14-7 against the preseason number one, made Arch Manning look lost, made <strong>two </strong>goal-line stands, and at least for one week, I stave off that stress-induced heart attack that <strong>will </strong>kill me one of these days. New starting Quarterback Julian Sayin did what he needed to, didn&#8217;t blow it, and the defense looked like a pack of killers from what I&#8217;ve gleaned post-game. Are we good enough to repeat as National Champions? Probably not, but I feel very lucky that I&#8217;ve gotten to see three Natties in my lifetime, and I&#8217;m still in that post-championship glow period. As long as we beat Michigan this year, I&#8217;ll take not winning a championship. I&#8217;ll take the gold pants over a gold trophy if I have to choose between the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those not drowned in why I&#8217;ve seen be described as &#8220;midwestern Doom Opera&#8221;, Ohio State&#8217;s biggest rival is Michigan. Every year, they play in what is known simply as &#8220;The Game&#8221;. No trophy, no cute rivalry name, no. It is &#8220;The Game&#8221;, and Ohio State has lost the last four games in the series, after winning seven of them in a row. That game, plays havoc so badly on my nerves that I will do nearly <strong>anything </strong>to <strong>not</strong> watch it. I will clean my house, I will work overtime at my job, I will go drive to god-knows-where to get something, or just go where there is no cell service so that I won&#8217;t be able to check the score. Those aren&#8217;t examples I&#8217;ve pulled from thin air, either. I&#8217;ve done <strong>all </strong>of those things in the past to not watch The Game. This game against Texas? I was hitting that level of stress a month ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;d I do to mitigate it? I ran errands, I went and did things, I did as much as I possibly could to push this game out of my mind as long as I could stand it. I took my mom for coffee, I went to Lowe&#8217;s and bought paint, I went to the Amish bakery, I bought mums to plant, I drove to Walmart and hemmed and hawed about what pens I wanted to buy, I drove to another county blasting my music just because I could. I did all these things, and still the need to check that score crept in. So, when I got to a place to pull off, I did just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth quarter, 3:28 to go, and Texas just scored. Shit, here it comes. My anxiety goes from a 3 on the scale of 1-10, to a 12. I throw on more music, I throw on a podcast, even my beloved Hangman Page&#8217;s theme, &#8220;Ghost Town Triumph&#8221; can&#8217;t dull the nerves for me. When I finally muster the nerve to check in again, I see it. &#8220;Ohio State 14, Texas 7, End of Game&#8221;. Oh my god. Oh my god! They&#8217;ve done it! I&#8217;m over the moon, all my stress fades away in an instant. I&#8217;m now 30 miles from home and at a stop sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My drive home wasn&#8217;t nearly as nerve-wracking as my drive to where I wound up. Sure, it&#8217;s a holiday weekend, and there are cops crawling the highway, whatever, I&#8217;m driving exactly the speed limit. I turn off to a backroad that will get me most of the way to where I want to get off of the highway at to go home. I know this song and dance, I used this road many a time to dodge cops setting speed traps in those four years I spent driving this highway every day. I know where they camp at, I know <strong>when </strong>they camp. Me turning off and driving a lesser-used road that gets me to the same place a little slower than the highway is no big deal to me. Maybe the happy pill <strong>is </strong>working, because the two cops I saw in that town would have scared the life out of me a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>But, all that is a way for me to kind of realize that I don&#8217;t <strong>have </strong>to set myself into a pressure cooker every time there&#8217;s something that will stress me out. I get stressed over high-stakes football games, okay, I don&#8217;t <strong>have</strong> to watch them? I can watch them after the fact, or just skip it altogether if it&#8217;s a result I don&#8217;t like. If that tOSU/UTexas game comes on as a rerun sometime, hell <strong>yes</strong> I&#8217;ll watch it. Ohio State/Michigan from 2021-whenever we finally can beat them again? Nah. I can skip it. My coworker hasn&#8217;t given me <strong>too much </strong>crap about it the past few years, and my new boss is a Texas fan, so, I probably shouldn&#8217;t needle him about this game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same with seeing those cops while I was driving. I think I can trust myself more than I used to, know that as long as I&#8217;m not doing anything wrong, they have no reason to pull me over. I&#8217;m driving the speed limit, I&#8217;m not driving erratically, I&#8217;m not on my phone, I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;m supposed to, I shouldn&#8217;t need to panic. Maybe it&#8217;s the happy pills talking, but I drove past a speed check on my journey, and didn&#8217;t lose my mind immediately when I saw the cop. Okay, speed limit&#8217;s 45 and I&#8217;m going 44, we&#8217;re good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When that last Saturday of November comes up, I&#8217;ll probably do the same thing. Ideally, I won&#8217;t have to take a cat to the Vet that day, like in 2022, but, I can find things to occupy my mind the majority of it. I can make a long drive to somewhere if it means I don&#8217;t turn into a puddle of nerves at the sight of the colors Maize and Blue. I can throw my music on, listen to my podcasts, find diversions to take the stress and anxiety of this thing I can&#8217;t control off of me for long enough for it to go down, the dust to settle, and me to calm my nerves.

I went to pay the mortgage and get pizza after work, sue me (don&#8217;t actually). It came to my mind when I went to pick up the pizza, and the guy who runs the place spoke to me, asked me how my dad was. I did all the usual pleasantries, &#8220;old and sleepy, haha&#8221; , but that isn&#8217;t my point. My point is that, man, 16-year-old me would <strong>hate </strong>34-year-old me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, in a long-since former life, I, my dad, and to an extent my mom, all worked for the guy who supplied their arcade machines in the pizza place&#8217;s &#8220;game room&#8221;. That&#8217;s how he knows us, because he&#8217;d see us at least once a week to collect the machines and give him his cut of the money they made. Sometimes it&#8217;d be a ton, sometimes it&#8217;d be barely $50 total for the whole room, but, we didn&#8217;t screw him on his money, like our boss would. And with this being Labor Day Weekend, they&#8217;re going to be hopping all weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that got me and my mom to talking about how we&#8217;d have taken care of his business had we actually been the ones making decisions back then. That pizza place, and a couple other locations that would have been our &#8220;Crown Jewels&#8221;, AKA, &#8220;the ones who get the absolute <strong>best </strong>machines, most detailed support, consistently checking in to make sure we <strong>keep</strong> them as a client&#8221;. Then it hit me, that the younger me, who had to be given the &#8220;if you aren&#8217;t going to work, you aren&#8217;t going to get paid, now let&#8217;s just go&#8221; from my dad back then, he would never have been like that. He&#8217;d have done&#8230;about the same as that old boss, only without snorting all the profits to support a pain pill habit. How that man even made it to 60-ish I will <strong>never</strong> know.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now, mid-30s me is kind of a workaholic, hell, I&#8217;m picking up a holiday shift and Saturday next week at work because I have nothing else going on. Teenage me most certainly was not like that. We only got paid a little bit more than gas money back then, so, that carrot on the stick was pretty small, and Final Fantasy XI was well into its heyday as well, so, I wanted to spend <strong>every</strong> waking moment in front of the Xbox 360 playing it. I didn&#8217;t want to work, or do chores, or run errands, or do yard work, no. I wanted to sit and play this game until my eyes bled, and then play some more. That isn&#8217;t a good way to start a career, even if it&#8217;s under-the-table because I was in high school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until mid-college that I actually started getting myself in gear to do class work, actually <strong>go </strong>to work and class, not be a lazy piece of crap at my best. Sure, my grades in high school were great, but I didn&#8217;t have to try. College, and the actual working world where I didn&#8217;t get to set my hours, that made me have to knuckle down, and drag myself across the line to get things done when I didn&#8217;t want to. That, eventually became just doing it when it came up instead of just putting in the bare minimum of effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, thinking about going to collect the machines from that pizza place, or the resort we had machines at, especially on a holiday weekend? 34-year-old me would have been hounding 16-year-old me as hard as my dad did back then. That&#8217;s the biggest clients we have, you can play games <strong>later</strong>, we take care of these guys, end of story. Grab your wallet, your shoes and let&#8217;s get going.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Me now would have had a gameplan for what clients we collect each day, what vending machines we did restocks on, and wedge in slack time to go do repairs for clients that needed an arcade cabinet fixed. We&#8217;d be cross-referencing clients&#8217; operating days and hours, and determine our route for the day based on that information. Go service locations A/B/C/D on Monday, D/E/F on Tuesday, G/H/I and penciling in replacing a coin chute on a location at C on Wednesday, and so on. My younger self would have thrown a fit at me, but, running a successful, sustainable business means you have to get up and do the work. I know how I was, a moody, snippy little prick, and me now has no time or patience for that nonsense. Me now has a schedule, a routine, and a laundry list of things that need done each day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That pizza shop? We&#8217;ve known the owners for 20+ years, I went to school with their daughter/granddaughter (the other owner is that guy&#8217;s father-in-law). We moved a pizza oven into a location they were setting up pro-bono (and I witnessed them arguing about the logistics of it in Spanish saying a lot of words my teacher at the time wouldn&#8217;t teach us), even now, years after that old boss and that shop broke things off, he asks how my dad is. Like, if he needed us for anything, we&#8217;d probably help out no questions asked. That isn&#8217;t something you develop without actually caring for the client, without actually getting up and going when they call with a problem. That&#8217;s where past and present me would have our biggest clash of heads. He both didn&#8217;t, nor did he want to try. I don&#8217;t necessarily <strong>want </strong>to have to try, but, it&#8217;s gotta be done, and no one else is coming, it <strong>has </strong>to be me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have to work tomorrow, but, I&#8217;ve got things to keep me busy. I&#8217;m on the hook for going to buy mums tomorrow, which will distract me during the Ohio State/Texas game, it&#8217;s work, but it&#8217;s things that probably need to be handled now, when I have a minute, rather than later, when I don&#8217;t. That six-day week is going to crunch me for time next Saturday, so, I have plans for this one. We need paint for the living room, we&#8217;re going to get mums, and I have a yard to mow Sunday. My younger self would be dragging ass to get one of those things done, and while current me will be, it&#8217;ll be because he&#8217;s trying to get them all taken care of, instead of wanting to go inside and play games all day.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/29/blaugust2025-day-29-not-pleased-to-meet-me/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1996.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1996.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

So, I&#8217;m going to sit here, play my silly little games, watch my silly little cartoons, and try not to think too hard before work tomorrow. I also forgot to take my happy pill this morning, so, the comedown from that has me a little erratic right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like, I think I need a day occasionally where I don&#8217;t take my medicine, just to let myself feel all those emotions that the medicine represses, or I just repress because I&#8217;m a bundle of neuroses and unresolved traumatic incidents. Then the next day, I take my happy pill, and get right back into the saddle. It&#8217;s a nice balance, I think.

Then I became a teacher for five minutes trying to get this proverbial horse to drink after dragging it to the water. They&#8230;aren&#8217;t getting much better than this, are they? When even my Tier 3s are saying they have zero faith in this hiring class, it&#8217;s not been a fun time. God bless the three competent people down there playing Sisyphus&#8217; greatest hits every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I seem to be sitting in the dark writing instead of turning on my lamp for the evening. The goal is to make some headway in Xenoverse 2 tonight, maybe throw in some No Man&#8217;s Sky with its new update if I get time to. Very glad that tomorrow is Friday, because the two days I have off will be it before I go into a six-day week next week, with 16 hours of overtime. Gotta love holiday pay.

Instead of remoting in, documenting the issue, you tell them I&#8217;ll call them back once I clock back in, and do nothing with it? Oh, they got their call, straight to their Voicemail. Still waiting on that call to be returned, by the way. If it comes in while I&#8217;m out for the evening, too bad. I&#8217;m off the clock, someone else can deal with it, it isn&#8217;t like I don&#8217;t take calls for their cases while they&#8217;re away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like, it&#8217;s frustrating to see. I get irritated when I get calls from other departments where the transfer notes are just my department&#8217;s three-letter designation in our call software. But, I&#8217;ve battled many times with many people over crappy documentation, I&#8217;m used to it. When someone on my own team gets a call and gives us nothing to work with? I was halfway towards flying off the handle, happy pills or no.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>There are some days where I really wonder <strong>why </strong>my job keeps me around, but, there are <strong>also </strong>days like today, where it becomes readily apparent that I am in fact, far better than I give myself credit for. I&#8217;ve repeated it a million times by now, but my notes are thorough, my documentation is there, if I see a problem, and I can work it, I will show what I did. I will explain why I did it, and give a rundown of the case for the next person to see the case. If I send something to another department, I will tell you <strong>exactly </strong>why I sent it, what my reason is, and what I want you to do. If I close a case, or dispatch it out, you will know my reasoning for what I&#8217;d done, because you can&#8217;t read my mind, and I can&#8217;t read yours either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see my own people doing the same shit I light into other departments for? I see red. What do you mean you didn&#8217;t put any notes into the case, even just to say you took a call on it and reporting what the client says!? Or when a case calls in, I get the call and the only update is someone telling the client to call us? What the hell kind of Customer Service is that!?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have gone to my boss, and every boss I have had in nine years on this subject, and the post-Covid, &#8220;everyone is permanently work-from-home&#8221; years has only made it worse. Those of us who are working towards moving up, you can tell what our work looks like, detailed notes, documentation of what was done, what our next steps should be. My cracking jokes about having nightmares that I&#8217;m late for work and crashing my car in a parking garage are not indicative of the quality of my work when it&#8217;s time <strong>to </strong>work. No, when it&#8217;s time to go, we go. I know my stuff, and I prove it with my case updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I know, not everyone works like me, but that isn&#8217;t even my point! My point is that we owe it to the client to give them our best shot whenever they call in, or get them to who can. When my own people won&#8217;t even remote in and do the bare minimum of troubleshooting on an issue, it <strong>really </strong>burns me up. Because then it seems like we aren&#8217;t even trying. Which makes us as a team, as a company, look bad to those clients paying us a <strong>lot </strong>of money for our products and support for those products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took a call on this person&#8217;s case the day before, and resolved the issue in a few minutes. When I did, I noted down what I did, documented the steps I took to resolve the issue, and reiterated that in my closing notes. Not because I was trying to style on them, but because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m <strong>supposed</strong> to do, and also to give them notes on how to fix that issue the next time they see it. Because that&#8217;s how I have my little note repository, I take those fixes, write them out, and save them! My notes go back nine years, and I&#8217;m <strong>still</strong> sorting through them to through into my OneNote book for work!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not asking for the world, I&#8217;m asking for basic competence from the people on my team. Some of us are more than pulling our weight, doing all those things that are expected to adequately take care of a client, while others are doing the bare minimum and only succeeding at frustrating us, and the customer.

Because one of the myriad of ideas he rapid-fires at me when I&#8217;m trying to work actually clicked something in my head for a character. And surprisingly, it&#8217;s one I should have seen a million miles away, and he <strong>yammed </strong>it home with the concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, out of all the characters I&#8217;ve created for my little car-crash setting of the &#8220;Alterverse&#8221;, my personal little fanfiction-adjacent playground for ideas, Eoghanan is my personal favorite. He&#8217;s the ideal me in my mind, was a legitimate baseball prospect at Shortstop in high school, became an adventurer and knight, married his high school sweetheart, works as a teacher because he wants to help raise up the next generations, he&#8217;s everything I wanted to be growing up. He&#8217;s gone through a lot in his life, lost friends to violence, been taken captive, nearly lost the love of his life, but has pulled through to survive and help others. But what happens when you rip it all away? What happens when all those things that ground him, all those people who mold him into who he is, what happens when you tear them all away? That&#8217;s a question my brother asked, and hit a home run (to push the baseball metaphor harder) with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He asked the question, &#8220;what if Eoghanan was raised into Undeath as a Death Knight?&#8221;, which lead to a perfect title for him, &#8220;The Death Rider&#8221;. He came up with it because I told him once that the current starting point for nearly 40-year-old Eoghanan is &#8220;what if Jon Moxley (pro wrestler) had a sword?&#8221;. The dry humor, the beginning of gravel to his voice, kind of adopting &#8220;Wild Thing&#8221; as a personal anthem, the springboard I use for him is just Mox. Not leader of &#8220;The Death Riders&#8221; Mox, but closer to Blackpool Combat Club, loose-cannon badass Mox. As he put in his autobiography, sort of a John McClane from Die Hard type.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>He set the table for that incarnation based on the Fractures In Time from World of Warcraft, where versions of characters from other timelines intersect with the main one. He started with the idea of Highlord Marnes, or &#8220;Deathlord Frostbane had he never been killed at Lordaeron&#8221;, and branched from there. He got to The Death Rider, and my mind went off. I started getting ideas of how we got here, what caused him to become a Death Knight, and what that timeline looks like because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So picture this, Legion, The Burning Shores. Designate Killjoy is called back in to counter the Burning Legion&#8217;s incursion on Azeroth. Our intrepid strike team ports in from Vana&#8217;Diel, not knowing The Horrors would await them. It doesn&#8217;t go well. Like in the main line, Highlord Tirion Fordring, King Varian, and Warchief Vol&#8217;Jin all fall on the shore. But it doesn&#8217;t end there. One by one, Killjoy is cut down by the Legion. Merrex, Rayder, Kate, Firewalker, Scarlet, Lance, and even Vera fall. Eoghanan is all that&#8217;s left. Blood pouring from his body, Scythe and Greatsword in hand, he steadies for his last hurrah, his last stand in a losing battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Army Of Light takes the Shore, the combined might of the various factions of Azeroth, and the full weight of the Galactic Federation behind them are just <strong>barely </strong>enough to win the day. But the cost is high. Deaths are in the thousands, Killjoy isn&#8217;t special in this case, squad after squad is wiped out entirely, as the Deathlord walks through the now quiet battlefield to try and begin to tally the dead, a hand clings to his boot. A voice weakly calling to him amidst the carnage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Deathlord! I-I know you can hear me! They&#8217;re dead! All of them!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Malone?&#8221; He crouches down to comfort the shellshocked knight. &#8220;How badly are you injured? Speak to me, stay with me boy!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to make it. I can&#8217;t move, I can&#8217;t feel my legs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pall washes over his face, he knows that this is the end of the line. A quiet look of acceptance and resignation as he accepts his death, and maybe, just maybe getting to see Vera again. As he closes his eyes and tries to drift off, all he can see is the image of the Burning Legion ending her life, again, and again. He seems them cutting down his friends, all with the same deranged look of glee and satisfaction, not even in the name of Sargeras. His eyes open, acceptance and resignation turned into anger and a need for vengeance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Marnes. I&#8217;m not going to make it. Will you&#8230;will you raise me as a Death Knight?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Samuel, you know not what you ask for, you know that your soul will not rest, even should we defeat the Legion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t care. She&#8217;s gone, Deathlord. They killed her. They killed all of them. I&#8217;m not going to make it off this beach either&#8230;I&#8217;m bleeding out, I can&#8217;t move. So please, let me be of some use.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Deathlord raises one of his Blades of the Fallen Prince, &#8220;&#8230;it shall be done.&#8221; The blade pierces Eoghanan&#8217;s heart, ending his suffering, as a blue swirl of energy emanates from his body and the sword.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a (very) rough setup for how he gets from Point A to Point B, but the general bones are there. Legion, but Everything Goes Badly. Once he&#8217;s raised into Undeath by Bolvar Fordragon, he becomes the Deathlord&#8217;s right hand, carrying a Rune Forged incarnation of Balmung into battle, leaning into the Blood discipline. From there, he scours the Broken Isles, becoming a one-man army of vengeance toward the Legion. Gone are the jokes, gone is the light-hearted nature, gone is the need to hold back on those who wronged him. He becomes a terror in his own right, carving bloody swathes through the demonic hordes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he crosses over to the main universe in Fractures, his counterparts are horrified at what he&#8217;s become. Meeting himself, main Eoghanan sees what he could have become had he lost those closest to him. Highlord Marnes is shocked at the level of violence that The Death Rider is willing to go to in order to battle back the Void. In his universe, the Legion took an immeasurable toll on all those who walked out the other side. Azeroth, and countless other planets bearing the scars of their war. Even main Frostbane is saddened that someone he&#8217;s seen grow as a soldier and as a man, would willingly set himself down this awful path in order to avenge those he&#8217;s lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t a final draft of that concept that my brother came up with. Not even close, but, it is something that I can mentally chew on, an idea that I can just go a little nuts with, because it doesn&#8217;t tie into my internal, overarching narrative. It doesn&#8217;t conflict with anything I consider &#8220;canon&#8221;, and can use it as a way to explore different themes and motivations for characters I thought I&#8217;d known for as long as I&#8217;ve been doing this. It&#8217;s a fun little narrative experiment that I can go on, and for once, I kind of have to hand it to my brother for jumping on a really fun concept.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/26/blaugust2025-day-26-lets-get-edgy/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_1520-1.png'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_1520-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I&#8217;m not great at it, seeing as I&#8217;m the slowest person in the room in terms of pure reaction speed, but, I&#8217;m kind of holding my own. I did manage to take the first actual boss down along with me in one run last night, so, technically I&#8217;ve beaten the first area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an Early Access game that just hit its EA release in the past week (as of time of writing), so, it&#8217;s missing a lot of things. Weapons, levels, parts of its story, but having followed Ultrakill&#8217;s development like I have, it isn&#8217;t a huge deal. I can play what&#8217;s there, the rest when it&#8217;s added, and a full run once it&#8217;s all out. The way it plays reminds me of Ultrakill as well, with having to play aggressively to keep topped up on health, a grapple that you use to throw objects at targets, and me having to tap dance on my mouse and keyboard to keep up. I like it, even if it is physically demanding for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5197" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1984.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, I only have two weapons, the pistol and assault rifle, but you can only take one with you on a run. To compensate for your lack of firearms, you get a sword, grenades that recharge after a few seconds, and the ability to gain abilities to shoot at enemies. While you&#8217;re on a run, you&#8217;ll gain upgrades to attach to yourself and your weapons, that you&#8217;ll keep for the duration of said run. What I found worked really well for me was using a chain-lightning ability, increased grenade range and damage, along with stacking 60+ percent recoil reduction on my rifle as I technically cleared the first area, albeit dying right as I killed the boss.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5201" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1981.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;s the game about so far? You are Subject 1473, thrown onto a train and dumped off in an apartment-looking holding cell. Before you drop into your first run, you drop down to a secret area under your room, where the previous Subject 1473 brings you up to speed on why you&#8217;re here. He&#8217;s dead. He&#8217;s a disembodied voice telling you plug a chip into your head from a skeleton. It&#8217;s fine, don&#8217;t worry about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5198" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1980.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You are&#8230;somewhere. Somewhere under the watchful eye of IDRIS, an AI overlord obsessed with &#8220;testing&#8221; his subjects. Sounds like GLaDOS, except IDRIS &#8220;tests&#8221; by making them fight through waves upon waves of machines. You aren&#8217;t the first, nor are you the last. The previous 1473 says you <strong>can</strong> escape, but only by fighting your way to freedom. May as well get started, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5199" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1979.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally you&#8217;ll be shifted from the area you&#8217;re in, to what seems like an office complex, for a &#8220;Voidaxis Industries&#8221;, seems kind of specific, almost like they had a hand in&#8230;whatever this is. Logs will occasionally be found that talk about the beginning of whatever crisis this is, or notes from other, less fortunate test subjects. I found one who told that she was going to hole up under a rock, and left whoever found the note a upgrade item. I didn&#8217;t see her, so either she&#8217;s Hide And Seek Grand Champion, or she also fell to the same thing as the previous 1473.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5200" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1982.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, what&#8217;s so interesting about it? Well, it&#8217;s not like every run is the same, you&#8217;ll have branching paths after certain islands in the area you&#8217;re in. You&#8217;ll fight, you&#8217;ll traverse, and occasionally be given the option of going one way towards say, an Item Chest, or a Corruption that you can take on to give yourself a better shot at better rewards, should you survive. Or you can see splits for say, an Obelisk that will give you something, in exchange for possibly damaging you or taking an upgrade away. Or you can get something as simple as a shop that lets you pick from a range of upgrades in exchange for Credits you&#8217;ll pick up from crates and enemies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5202" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1985.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also enhance your character with Decryptors to unlock upgrades on three separate trees, but you aren&#8217;t pigeonholed down one path at a time, or in any particular order. Then once unlocked, you can upgrade those upgrades with Voidium, a resource you pick up from chests and crates, that does persist between runs. I don&#8217;t have many upgrades unlocked, but the ones for increased health, and health back after completing an island are almost invaluable. The most recent runs I&#8217;ve played have gone down much, much smoother with more health, and being able to heal between fights.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5203" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1986.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of, how <strong>do</strong> you heal? Well, you heal by staggering enemies, which you can do a couple different ways. First, you can stagger them with those grenades that charge back up after a few seconds, or, the even more fun way, by using the Gravity Tether. The Tether, lets you grab objects (or debris from the environments you can wreak havoc upon) and hurl them at enemies. If you get certain upgrades, you can trigger elemental effects on Tether throws, like freezing anything that was hit. So, if you <strong>really</strong> felt like it, you could log a canister of explosives at a group, and on top of blowing them up, staggering them, you can <strong>also</strong> freeze them to pick them off and grab the health and ammunition that drops for your specialized bullets. Regular ammo? Infinite, the specialized stuff? You need to find more of, but that limit can be enhanced with upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, it&#8217;s a really fun game that I&#8217;m finding more and more things out about the more that I play it. I&#8217;m finding synergies with abilities, weapon mods, grenades, all that open up new ways to play it and progress further in the story. Being able to power slide through a group of enemies, throw a chain-lightning bolt, and then lob a grenade at those stunned targets, then zip back in with a sword and hack them up is a fun time any way you, uh, &#8220;cut&#8221; it (thank you, I&#8217;ll be here all week, tip your waiter). The ability to blow up a building full of enemies, then lob chunks of that blown-up building at who&#8217;s left is a huge power-fantasy moment that you can just do, no special tricks involved. Even some of the Gamble/Relocation rooms you can go to are pretty clever, especially one that I want to spoil, but won&#8217;t. The only hint I&#8217;ll give is &#8220;don&#8217;t blink&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5204" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1983.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by the story so far with the game, I want to know who the last 1473 was, why I&#8217;m in whatever I&#8217;m in, what IDRIS is, all these things that I have questions about. Am I trapped in some kind of computer simulation? What&#8217;s the outside world look like? What is Voidaxis Industries, and what is their connection to IDRIS? I want to know, and they have me on the hook as to getting those answers because it&#8217;s all so vague and hazy at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add in that all of this is done by <strong>one guy</strong>, and I&#8217;m even more amazed at what developer Daniel Stubbington/Stubby Games has done so far, and I can&#8217;t wait to see the rest of the game. Because something like this, with a ton of intrigue, sci-fi weirdness, and questions I need answers for is <strong>so </strong>far up my alley that I bought the game without hesitation. I love FPS games that play with movement, and this game has it in spades. You move fast, you fight fast, you fight hard, and you have all these tricks that you can pull to even the odds in your favor, it&#8217;s a really fun time so far.

The game already started badly: In classical JRPG fashion, there is a sort of tutorial to teach you about the world, your place in it, and the basics of gameplay. And that tutorial is 4 hours long, unless you skip all that endless dialogue and exposition. It doesn\'t help that a good chunk of that time is taken up by black loading screens; they are only a few seconds long, but they happen extremely often. A real throwback to the time of PS2 and PS3 titles.<div><br /></div><div>Finally I got into the city and the real game began with me being introduced to the calendar system. This was new to me, as I haven\'t played any of the Persona games. I was told that I had 10 days until some calamity struck, so I had to finish a certain dungeon by that time. No problem, I thought, as the preparation before that, including doing city quests to reach Wisdom 2, which opened up the purification feature and a side dungeon quest, only took a few days. So I entered the main dungeon, and was starting to have fun. 8 hours later I had finished both the side dungeon and the main story dungeon before the time limit, when the game decided to slap me in the face and told me that I did it wrong.</div><div><br /></div><div>You see, these dungeons have "rest" areas called Magla Hollows. But you can\'t actually rest there, only save the game and do some dialogue. They don\'t fill up your magic points, which are the main limiting resource in dungeon runs. However, then the game introduced me to the option of using the Magla Hollow or other save points (in the form of a cat) to teleport back to the entrance. From there I could exit back into the city, rest properly in a tavern, and then get back into the dungeon, teleporting right back to the Magla Hollow. Great! Basically exchange a calendar day for a mana refill. Should be fine, as long as I don\'t need more days than the time limit. <b>Wrong!</b> It turned out after the dungeon that you get any calendar days not used in the dungeon as free days, which you can use to increase your virtues, bonds with other characters, do quests, or grind. These free days are extremely valuable, especially at the start of the game. And I had basically wasted them, by using the outside rest option whenever my mana was a bit low, instead of wringing the maximum out of each magic point.</div><div><br /></div><div>For me, good game design has failing forward options: If you aren\'t doing that well, the game should help you along in order to not fail at later, even more difficult challenges. Metaphor Refantazio reminds me of Valkyria Chronicles in as far as these games have failing backwards systems: They make the game easier for you if you played in a specific developer-intended "perfect" way, and punish you if you play casually, try out things, and are "inefficient" by very specific metrics. That is especially galling if you either need knowledge from previous games or guides, or get the information about what you should have done later in the game, and should basically replay parts of it "optimally" to get the best rewards.</div><div><br /></div><div>So I read some guides and tips about Metaphor Refantazio, and was told something I otherwise would have learned only much later in the game: Each character has an ultimate archetype, but you can only play that one, if you ranked up very specific archetypes throughout the game. If you are again playing casually, and try out a wide variety of archetypes on each character for fun, you might get to a point where you simply don\'t have the time to still level the archetypes you need high enough to fulfill the conditions for the ultimate archetype. Unless you use a very specific exploit that allows you to farm infinite amounts of archetype xp. So, hey, I\'m kind of happy that my Game Pass subscription ends in a week, and I won\'t be able to reach the end of Metaphor Refantazio anyway. Because if I have the choice of playing a RPG either for maximum fun while trying out a lot of things, or for maximum efficiency, I\'ll always choose the fun. Even if the game at some point would tell me that now I can\'t finish the game, due to all the accumulated penalties for not playing perfectly. I call that bad game design.</div><div><br /></div><div>Apart from the failing backwards design, Metaphor Refantazio is fun enough in a very classical way. It does look a bit old-fashioned, compared to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which I just played recently. But the archetype system and the turn-based combat are all very entertaining. The story and world aren\'t half bad, although again a bit more classical: In my 12 hours I did fight a lot of wolves, goblins, skeletons, and a minotaur, but also a few more original monsters, weirdly called "humans". I am totally fine playing this game for another week, and then stopping somewhere in the middle.

So it is probably not surprising that <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/openai-erotica-chatgpt-anti-porn-group-ncose-1236553925/" target="_blank">OpenAI wants some of that money</a>.<div><br /></div><div>Of course they aren\'t the first ones. There are already lots of platforms offering "AI girlfriends", including paid-for NSFW options. But what struck me about the OpenAI announcement wasn\'t the shock that the internet could be used for porn, but the implied admission of failure: The valuation of all those AI companies is linked to a general idea that AI is going to make hundreds of billions of dollars by replacing a huge number of human jobs cheaper. Even if OpenAI "Erotica" would end up making as much money as OnlyFans, this is hardly in the same league of financial profits. <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/economy" target="_blank">Global AI investment in 2024 was $252 billion</a>, which is <a href="https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/adult-entertainment-global-market-report" target="_blank">about 4 times the size of the global adult entertainment market</a>. You simply can\'t reach trillions in market capitalization with just porn.</div><div><br /></div><div>For me this is another sign of the impending bursting of the AI bubble. I am seeing more and more comments in which analysts when asked about the risk of a bubble point out how just before a bubble the stock markets rise the most; sophisticated financial institutions have faster access to the stock market, and can bail out faster than retail customers, who would be left holding the bag when the market crashes.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/9166503888855521661/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/9166503888855521661', 'title': '5 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/9166503888855521661'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/9166503888855521661'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/10/sounds-like-admission-of-failure.html', 'title': 'Sounds like an admission of failure'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '5'}

Belgium holds a record for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%932011_Belgian_government_formation" target="_blank">running the longest time without an elected government</a>, for 589 days in 2010-2011. The interesting thing about that was how it was organized: Everything continued to function, state employees were paid, benefits were received, the ordinary citizen didn\'t even notice there was no government. Funnily enough, as no government meant that no new spending could be passed, the rating agencies upgraded Belgium during that time to a better credit rating.<div><br /></div><div>This appears to be in sharp contrast to the United States of America, who manage to have government shutdowns in which people don\'t get paid while having an elected government. That seems to be a somewhat inefficient way to run a country. On the other hand, it is probably wise to have some mechanism in the constitution that necessitates a minimum of bipartisan support for budgets. Because the truth of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of governments in history spent more than their revenue and accumulated debt.</div><div><br /></div><div>Every government spending is fundamentally redistributive. If you build schools, taxpayer money from childless families is redistributed to the benefit of those who have children. Social safety nets like health care and welfare tend to redistribute money progressively, from the rich to the poor. But there are also a lot state expenditures like business subsidies that redistribute money regressively, from the poor to the rich. And taxes also can be more progressive or more regressive. End of last year in the UK, there were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj71zyy934o" target="_blank">protests against a tax</a> that specifically targeted only a loophole in inheritance taxes for over&nbsp;£1 million, where millionaires like Jeremy Clarkson pretended to be poor and unable to afford such a tax. Many countries have loopholes that enable most millionaires and billionaires to not pay any inheritance tax at all. Warren Buffett famously declared that he was paying a lower tax rate than his secretary, as in many places passive income from investment is taxed a lot lower than active income from work.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am old enough to remember US government shutdowns, which were at least in part motivated by Republican fiscal hawks trying to stop Democrats from tax and spend policies. But that idea ended around the turn of the millenium. These days neither party is even remotely trying to balance the budget, and the US national debt has gone up from under $6 trillion at the turn of the millenium to over $37 trillion today. Why?</div><div><br /></div><div>My theory is that Republicans discovered that national debt is in fact not bad for the people they represent. Ultimately the national debt is only one more government expenditure, for interest payments on that debt. Taxpayer money is redistributed to the holders of treasury bonds. And that is by nature a regressive form of redistribution, poor people don\'t own treasury bonds. National debt provides a baseline, so-called "risk free" rate of interest, which is important for financial markets. So a lot of people with savings, and a lot of bankers, would be unhappy if the US had no national debt.</div><div><br /></div><div>Right now, the Democrats profit from the government shutdown by painting the Trump administration as inefficient and cruel, while the Republicans profit by it providing a convenient excuse to cut government spending they don\'t like, e.g. for federal employees. Behind the blame game, there is bipartisan support *for* a shutdown. So this isn\'t ending anytime soon. Unfortunately, if it ends, it will end with a compromise on more government spending, not less. There is no political party left with any interest in a balanced budget or a decrease of national debt. The UK learned under the short premiership of Liz Truss how that can quickly go wrong at some point. It is a political game of hot potato, where every administration hopes it will be the next one that has to balance the budget due to a bond market crisis. You gain votes by promising free money and low taxes to your voters, and you lose votes by balancing the budget and lowering the national debt. And even if the US government can\'t technically default, because they can print their own money, that too has consequences. There is no such thing as free money.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'I live in Belgium. Belgium holds a record for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%932011_Belgian_government_formation" target="_blank">running the longest time without an elected government</a>, for 589 days in 2010-2011. The interesting thing about that was how it was organized: Everything continued to function, state employees were paid, benefits were received, the ordinary citizen didn\'t even notice there was no government. Funnily enough, as no government meant that no new spending could be passed, the rating agencies upgraded Belgium during that time to a better credit rating.<div><br /></div><div>This appears to be in sharp contrast to the United States of America, who manage to have government shutdowns in which people don\'t get paid while having an elected government. That seems to be a somewhat inefficient way to run a country. On the other hand, it is probably wise to have some mechanism in the constitution that necessitates a minimum of bipartisan support for budgets. Because the truth of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of governments in history spent more than their revenue and accumulated debt.</div><div><br /></div><div>Every government spending is fundamentally redistributive. If you build schools, taxpayer money from childless families is redistributed to the benefit of those who have children. Social safety nets like health care and welfare tend to redistribute money progressively, from the rich to the poor. But there are also a lot state expenditures like business subsidies that redistribute money regressively, from the poor to the rich. And taxes also can be more progressive or more regressive. End of last year in the UK, there were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj71zyy934o" target="_blank">protests against a tax</a> that specifically targeted only a loophole in inheritance taxes for over&nbsp;£1 million, where millionaires like Jeremy Clarkson pretended to be poor and unable to afford such a tax. Many countries have loopholes that enable most millionaires and billionaires to not pay any inheritance tax at all. Warren Buffett famously declared that he was paying a lower tax rate than his secretary, as in many places passive income from investment is taxed a lot lower than active income from work.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am old enough to remember US government shutdowns, which were at least in part motivated by Republican fiscal hawks trying to stop Democrats from tax and spend policies. But that idea ended around the turn of the millenium. These days neither party is even remotely trying to balance the budget, and the US national debt has gone up from under $6 trillion at the turn of the millenium to over $37 trillion today. Why?</div><div><br /></div><div>My theory is that Republicans discovered that national debt is in fact not bad for the people they represent. Ultimately the national debt is only one more government expenditure, for interest payments on that debt. Taxpayer money is redistributed to the holders of treasury bonds. And that is by nature a regressive form of redistribution, poor people don\'t own treasury bonds. National debt provides a baseline, so-called "risk free" rate of interest, which is important for financial markets. So a lot of people with savings, and a lot of bankers, would be unhappy if the US had no national debt.</div><div><br /></div><div>Right now, the Democrats profit from the government shutdown by painting the Trump administration as inefficient and cruel, while the Republicans profit by it providing a convenient excuse to cut government spending they don\'t like, e.g. for federal employees. Behind the blame game, there is bipartisan support *for* a shutdown. So this isn\'t ending anytime soon. Unfortunately, if it ends, it will end with a compromise on more government spending, not less. There is no political party left with any interest in a balanced budget or a decrease of national debt. The UK learned under the short premiership of Liz Truss how that can quickly go wrong at some point. It is a political game of hot potato, where every administration hopes it will be the next one that has to balance the budget due to a bond market crisis. You gain votes by promising free money and low taxes to your voters, and you lose votes by balancing the budget and lowering the national debt. And even if the US government can\'t technically default, because they can print their own money, that too has consequences. There is no such thing as free money.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/6831409446988143800/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/6831409446988143800', 'title': '1 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6831409446988143800'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6831409446988143800'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/10/debt-budget-and-shutdowns.html', 'title': 'Debt, budget, and shutdowns'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '1'}

But this year I wanted to see whether maybe visiting the fair on Thursday evening and Friday morning is less crowded.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/5350212262795773235/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/5350212262795773235', 'title': '5 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5350212262795773235'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5350212262795773235'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/10/gaming-status-october-2025.html', 'title': 'Gaming status October 2025'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '5'}

Why?</p><p>I\'ll start by talking about my university days. I started as one of 108 students at that university in the chemistry department. By the time I got my diploma (masters degree), there were only 32 of us left. The other 70% had dropped out, having failed too many exams. On the other hand, we paid just 49 bucks in tuition per semester, so while we still had to pay for our cost of living and study materials, the financial burden was a lot lower. But that was in the 80\'s and 90\'s and in Germany.</p><p>Higher education has a lot fewer dropouts in the USA. The "overall status dropout rate" for high-school dropouts has gone down from 14.1% in 1976 to 5.3% in 2022.&nbsp;For colleges, between 1996 and 2017, the share of first-time, full-time students not graduating within six years fell by about 9 percentage points, from 44.6% to 35.5%. On the other hand, in the US over the last five decades, tuition cost has gone up by a factor of 4 *after* adjusting for inflation, and student loan debts are now&nbsp;the second-largest category of consumer debt after mortgages.</p><p>If you add up all those numbers, you realize something: The higher education system in the US doesn\'t treat the young people coming there as students, but rather as clients. In exchange for a rising fee, they will do their utmost to make sure you get the degree you are paying for. Educational standards be damned. On paper, that makes the US highly educated: From <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/fig_2.png" target="_blank">1940 to 2021 the percentage of population age 25+</a> without a high-school degree dropped from 75.9% to 8.9%, while the percentage of people with a bachelor\'s degree or more rose from 4.6% to 37.9%.</p><p>There are only two problems with that: The first one is that people who graduate from college in 2025 are a lot less educated than those who graduated 50 years ago. Especially over the last few years,&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/" target="_blank">AI has literally made students dumber</a>.&nbsp;One in five employed American adults with a bachelor’s degree <a href="https://www.opencampus.org/2021/06/10/a-troubling-lack-of-skills-in-literacy-and-numeracy/" target="_blank">lacks important skills in literacy, with one in three falling below proficient levels in numeracy</a>. A weird mix of economic incentives for teachers, and a belief that upholding academic standards was racist, have led to a widespread <a href="https://www.educations.com/higher-education-news/grade-inflation-in-education-a-growing-concern-for-us-students" target="_blank">US grade inflation</a>.</p><p>The second problem is that any economy only has so much use for highly educated people. If you would add a million Ph.D. level&nbsp;astrophysicists to an economy, that wouldn\'t be of much help, as most of them would end up serving fries at McDonalds.</p><p>Consider all that when you read about the jobocalypse. There are a lot of half-truths in that reporting. Have some jobs been lost to AI? Probably, but far fewer than you think. A lot of tech companies have simply hired too many people during the pandemic, and instead of admitting that, they explain their hiring freeze with AI, as that sounds better to investors. The growing unemployment numbers of college graduates have only a little to do with AI, and a lot to do with there being too many college graduates for the economy, and their actual education being of lower quality than it used to be. If you consider the US higher education system purely as a business, it is obvious that maximum throughput at maximum tuition fees produces the highest profits. The quality of the education isn\'t of much concern: You can identify the few actually brilliant people and encourage them to a career in academia, while any lack of education of the rest becomes a problem for other industries.</p><p>While higher education systems in other countries all have their own problems, they are mostly still retaining a higher percentage of meritocratic elements, and fewer business consideration. The result is on paper fewer graduates, but in reality higher education standards, and an output of people that aligns closer with the needs of industry.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': '<p>When I write about economics on this blog, I frequently write about global phenomena, like the growth of inequality, or how housing has globally become unaffordable.

On paper, that makes the US highly educated: From <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/fig_2.png" target="_blank">1940 to 2021 the percentage of population age 25+</a> without a high-school degree dropped from 75.9% to 8.9%, while the percentage of people with a bachelor\'s degree or more rose from 4.6% to 37.9%.</p><p>There are only two problems with that: The first one is that people who graduate from college in 2025 are a lot less educated than those who graduated 50 years ago. Especially over the last few years,&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/" target="_blank">AI has literally made students dumber</a>.&nbsp;One in five employed American adults with a bachelor’s degree <a href="https://www.opencampus.org/2021/06/10/a-troubling-lack-of-skills-in-literacy-and-numeracy/" target="_blank">lacks important skills in literacy, with one in three falling below proficient levels in numeracy</a>. A weird mix of economic incentives for teachers, and a belief that upholding academic standards was racist, have led to a widespread <a href="https://www.educations.com/higher-education-news/grade-inflation-in-education-a-growing-concern-for-us-students" target="_blank">US grade inflation</a>.</p><p>The second problem is that any economy only has so much use for highly educated people. If you would add a million Ph.D. level&nbsp;astrophysicists to an economy, that wouldn\'t be of much help, as most of them would end up serving fries at McDonalds.</p><p>Consider all that when you read about the jobocalypse. There are a lot of half-truths in that reporting. Have some jobs been lost to AI? Probably, but far fewer than you think. A lot of tech companies have simply hired too many people during the pandemic, and instead of admitting that, they explain their hiring freeze with AI, as that sounds better to investors. The growing unemployment numbers of college graduates have only a little to do with AI, and a lot to do with there being too many college graduates for the economy, and their actual education being of lower quality than it used to be. If you consider the US higher education system purely as a business, it is obvious that maximum throughput at maximum tuition fees produces the highest profits. The quality of the education isn\'t of much concern: You can identify the few actually brilliant people and encourage them to a career in academia, while any lack of education of the rest becomes a problem for other industries.</p><p>While higher education systems in other countries all have their own problems, they are mostly still retaining a higher percentage of meritocratic elements, and fewer business consideration. The result is on paper fewer graduates, but in reality higher education standards, and an output of people that aligns closer with the needs of industry.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/5206067061090591794/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/5206067061090591794', 'title': '5 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5206067061090591794'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5206067061090591794'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/10/education-is-not-just-financial.html', 'title': 'Education is not just a financial transaction'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '5'}

Videogames are a bit different: People use other words, like complex, or "difficult to learn", to describe a game like Europa Universalis. But calling a videogame just "difficult" in the overwhelming majority of cases means only one thing: The game demanding a very fast reaction time, and you not being able to progress if you aren\'t fast enough.

If the difficulty of a game lies in its complexity, that is something that can be overcome by studying the game. But for reaction time, there is a hard cap, which is biological.

Older people have always had more money than younger people, because they had the time to accumulate wealth or experience that translates into higher salaries.

There are no official numbers, but estimates from various sources, based on various data collected by players about players.

Before the release of WoT 2.0, estimated player numbers were down to 2.5 million, and we don\'t have numbers yet how much the new version was able to revive.</div><div><br /></div><div>Declining player numbers not only pose a financial problem to Wargaming, the company running the game. It also poses a financial problem to a number of YouTube channels that have dedicated their channel to World of Tanks content. Fewer players means fewer potential viewers, which means less revenue from content creation. And of course the content creators each have their own idea why World of Tanks is declining, and frequently blame Wargaming for some decision or other. This is also somewhat typical for YouTube: If you run a channel for a game and don\'t frequently criticize the game, you will be seen as a shill. Also the occasional <i>"World of Tanks is dying"</i> sensationalist / controversial video is good for viewer numbers, as controversy gets more clicks than <i>"this is fine"</i> content.</div><div><br /></div><div>So while Wargaming was mostly concerned how to monetize the remaining players, many YouTube channels were complaining about that monetization. That went as far as some channels organizing a "boycott", in which they wouldn\'t review the tanks from loot boxes. Unsurprisingly, Wargaming wasn\'t amused, and removed content creator privileges from the YouTubers complaining the loudest. Which didn\'t make the content on YouTube about World of Tanks any more positive.</div><div><br /></div><div>World of Tanks has, and always had, a slower pace than other online shooters. Especially with heavier tanks at higher tiers and with players using terrain and cover well, a lot of shots simply didn\'t penetrate armor. Which kept tanks alive longer, and led to matches being up to 15 minutes long. Now on the one side, Wargaming felt that a faster game would attract more players. On the other side, Wargaming wanted to sell stuff to players, like premium tanks and premium ammunition. So over the years, power creep occurred: The tanks today penetrate armor a lot more often, due to players using premium "Pay2Win" features. In addition, one of the major changes in World of Tanks 2.0 is an "armor flashlight", that makes it easier for less experienced players to see where the armor of the enemy is weak and can be penetrated.</div><div><br /></div><div>Between that, and the drive to get players back, or new players into the game, veterans of World of Tanks aren\'t happy: Too many people in a typical battle aren\'t very experienced, and play in a more YOLO style, which has become more viable due to that power creep. Thus battles are now much faster, often last only around 5 minutes, and feel very different to the more careful style the veterans are used to. Thus an increasing number of World of Tank content creators are just ranting about the game these days, which doesn\'t really help to promote it, and contributes to the downward spiral. Which also reduces their own viewer numbers. A video 5 years ago from Quickybaby about the best starting tech tree got 692k views, while an equivalent video from 2 weeks ago about which free tech tree to pick only got 255k views. It is pretty obvious that the World of Tanks ecosystem is not in a good shape. The game company and the content creators all make a lot less money than a few years ago, and often blame each other for that.</div><div><br /></div><div>Undoubtedly related to declining player numbers and the resulting matchmaking problems is the fact that World of Tanks today has a lot more PvE parts than it had 5 years ago, when I played last. Today, unless you turn it off, your first battles every day are PvE battles against bots. And why would you turn that off, when you are more likely to win against bots than against real players, and you get full credits and xp for those wins, they just don\'t affect ranking. There are also a number of PvE events, and a badly defined "new player protection mode", in which new players are again more likely to face bots as enemies, or other newer players, and are protected from "seal clubbing", as the practice of veteran players farming new players for xp and credits was known.</div><div><br /></div><div>But while the increase of PvE actually makes World of Tanks more attractive to me, I don\'t think I will play WoT 2.0 a lot.

Fate is a board game by designer Matt Leacock. Matt got his breakthrough in the board game industry with Pandemic, and has since then made several board games that are variations of the Pandemic system. Z-Man Games even created a trademark for <a href="https://www.zmangames.com/universe/pandemic-system/" target="_blank">Pandemic System</a> games, and added some more games not designed by Matt. There are Pandemic System games with a World of Warcraft theme, a Fall of Rome theme, a Dutch dikes themes, a Cthulhu theme, and Star Wars theme, and now Fate joins them as a Pandemic System game with a The Lord of the Rings theme. So I wasn\'t too impressed on hearing this game being announced, it sounded a lot like yet another milking of the same old cash cow. Then I got to play the game at a board game night, and my attitude changed. I even rushed out to buy a copy.<div><br /></div><div>So, what is the Pandemic System? All games with this system are cooperative board games, where the players together struggle to hold back a growing threat. After every player move, some enemy cards are revealed that make bad things happen. If players aren\'t efficient enough to fight the threats faster than they appear, things go downhill quickly. As a special twist, at some points in the game the already played enemy cards are shuffled and put back on the <b>top</b> of the enemy deck. Which means that some enemy cards you\'ll see repeatedly, concentrating the threat locally, and others not at all.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fate adds a new twist to this system: The enemy (shadow) cards now have two different backs. When you turn over the top shadow card, the back of the next card tells you whether to apply the effect on the top or the bottom. Bottom effects put shadow troops (think orcs) into play, bottom effects move those troops in the direction of some haven. This makes the new system slightly more varied than the standard Pandemic System, and Fate just might be the best Pandemic game just from a pure game mechanics point of view.</div><div><br /></div><div>But the reason I would really recommend Fate as a board game is the theme. Which means that my recommendation is addressed to anybody who has at least a decent knowledge of The Lord of the Rings, either by having read the books, or by having seen the films, or ideally both. We played Fate once with a guy who had no clue who Gandalf was, and he still had fun, but there is a huge amount of additional fun to have if you are somewhat knowledgeable of Tolkien\'s work. On the one side, the growing threat produced by the improved Pandemic System is a perfect fit for the growing threat of Sauron in The Lord of the Rings. Also the group being split up all over the map of Middle Earth is an obvious fit to the story. On the other side of things, the game cleverly references the memorable scenes of the books / movies by turning them into quests. On my first game, I was playing Gandalf the Grey, and I had to go to Moria, confront the Balrog, and come back as Gandalf the White. There is a good selection of different quests for different characters, only Frodo having to throw the One Ring into Mount Doom is always the final quest to win the game. Playing Fate feels a lot like The Lord of the Rings, the theme is extremely well integrated into gameplay, and if you like the theme, it adds a lot to the fun of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship costs about $80, or slightly cheaper at €65 in Europe. That makes it a lot cheaper than many of the crowdfunded games I own, but still relatively expensive compared to other retail games. My main point of criticism of the game is that it includes a cardboard dice tower; that adds a lot to table presence, but it is somewhat fiddly to put together, and you have to partially disassemble it to put it back into the box. As you often only throw 3 dice or less, it seems like an unnecessary cost element to me, although some other people absolutely love that thing. I like that the characters are screen printed on wooden pieces instead of being plastic miniatures. The allied and shadow troops are a bit on the small side. But kudos to Asmodee, who without fuzz agreed to send me a replacement for a damaged dwarven troop in my copy of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>Personally I like the cooperative nature of Fate, and its variability. But there being no hidden information opens the game up to the risk of one alpha gamer trying to boss around everybody else at the table to do what he says. Fate needs cooperation, but one needs to balance that with the need for player agency. I guess it depends very much on your gaming group. A group that is working very well together can potentially play Fate at a higher player count of 4 or 5; for most groups 2 or 3 players is probably safer. Also a matter of personal preference is your acceptance of luck in a game. Random characters having to do random quests means that different games can be very different in difficulty; the random nature of the shadow cards can also produce spikes of difficulty, or just ruin your plans by a bad luck draw. On the positive side, this keeps Fate very interesting, you aren\'t going to get to a situation where you feel you have already won only half way through the game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'Winning the award for the board game with the most unwieldy title this year, I\'ll call&nbsp;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/436217/the-lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-fellowship" target="_blank">The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</a> just Fate for the rest of this post.

On the positive side, this keeps Fate very interesting, you aren\'t going to get to a situation where you feel you have already won only half way through the game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/5484888468973093854/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/5484888468973093854', 'title': '0 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5484888468973093854'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5484888468973093854'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-lord-of-rings-fate-of-fellowship.html', 'title': 'The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '0'}

They envision a future with elements from films like The Terminator, or A Space Odyssey, where AI becomes self-aware, super-intelligent, and intent on oppressing or wiping out humans. I don\'t think any of that will happen during my lifetime, armed robots simply aren\'t really a thing yet. In 2025 there is a possibility, albeit a small one, that you get killed by an AI-driven car. But we don\'t even have enough data, enough widespread adoption, and enough standardized AI driving technology that we could even say whether an AI driver kills more or less people than a human driver. The large language model generative AI from software like ChatGPT can kill people indirectly by causing mental harm, e.g. encouraging suicide, but that is still very far from a Terminator future.<div><br /></div><div>In the medium term, a much more realistic fear of AI is that of a disruption of the jobs market through artificial intelligence. The nature of work will change somewhat if companies move towards a wider adoption of AI. New jobs will emerge, but some old jobs will disappear. If you never heard anybody describing his job as "Vibe Coding Cleanup Specialist", that is because that job didn\'t exist before AI. Today it does, but the company hiring him is probably hiring fewer regular coders.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe there is a much bigger short term risk of AI, but I will have to precede my thoughts with a "this is not financial advice" disclaimer. Stock markets are at an all time high. The S&amp;P 500 is now over 40% tech stocks, and most of those tech stocks are heavily invested in artificial intelligence. There is at least a non-zero probability that there is an AI bubble, that investors overestimated the gains companies can make with AI over the coming years, and that the bubble could burst when these gains don\'t get realized as fast as they thought. How does that work?</div><div><br /></div><div>What one needs to understand is the concept of market capitalization, market cap for short. For example Nvidia has&nbsp;24.4 billion shares outstanding, and these shares today trade at $177.75. If you multiply these two numbers, you get the Nvidia market cap of $4.3 trillion. The problem with the concept is that this is imaginary money. It would be impossible to exchange 24.4 billion shares of Nvidia for $4.3 trillion in cash, because the act of selling Nvidia shares would make the share price drop. The same is true for every other share. As long as more people want to buy these shares than there are for sale, stock prices rise. As soon as people want to sell and cash in, stock prices drop. If you bought Nvidia shares on January 1st 2023 for under $15 and sell them now for $177, you made a huge profit. If you buy Nvidia shares for $177 now, and in a year the stock price dropped by half, you would lose money on selling.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fundamentally, stock prices are correlated to what investors think the future of a company will look like. Recently OpenAI made a deal with Oracle to invest $300 billion in AI data centers built by Oracle. This raised the stock price of Oracle, but also of Nvidia, where Oracle would buy the chips for those data centers. If everything in this deal happens as announced, Oracle and Nvidia are expected to have higher revenue, and thus their stock prices rose on an expectation of that. But the future is uncertain, and this optimistic expectation of the future might just be plain wrong. OpenAI is actually losing money every year, and the $300 billion would have to come from investors. And then there is the practical difficulty of buying and powering that many data centers in just a few years. Once Nvidia has made the chips, sold them to Oracle, and Oracle has built the data centers, OpenAI still needs to figure out how to turn that $300 billion investment into a profitable revenue stream. With AI adoption by non-tech companies apparently slowing down, all that future profit isn\'t obvious.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe that stock markets are failing to price in the unintended consequences of the AI boom. For example, a lot of Americans have noticed their electricity prices going up, especially in regions where data centers have been built. Electricity is a regionally traded commodity, and if a lot of new electricity consumers go live, supply doesn\'t go up as fast as demand, and prices generally rise. That is a problem for AI data center owners, but also of all other industry using electricity, and of regular households.</div><div><br /></div><div>Another "unintended" consequence of AI is more unemployment. Where do the stock markets think the profits from AI will ultimately come from? The most straightforward way for a general company to make money with AI is to replace people by it, paying less for an "AI worker" than for the person who did the same job before. But if everybody has "lower labor cost", it also means that a lot of people are unemployed or earn a lot less. And these people are the customers for the companies on the stock market. We already see companies like McDonalds struggling because many of their customers are lower income households, and can\'t afford fast food anymore. If you directly translate aggregate lower labor cost into aggregate lower consumer spending, the future for some companies on the stock market looks a lot less rosy. Those aren\'t necessarily the same companies, e.g. Oracle does very little business with low income households. But right now a glorious AI future, whether it will happen or not, has already been priced into the stock price of the companies that might gain from it, and not yet into the stock price of the companies that would be at the losing end of that deal. I don\'t see McDonalds replacing a lot of its staff by AI, as AI isn\'t yet very good at flipping burgers.</div><div><br /></div><div>Investor optimism leads to overpriced stocks.&nbsp;"Irrational exuberance" in the words of Alan Greenspan. The price to earnings ratio of Nvidia is over 50, that of Oracle over 75. The historical average P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is between 10 and 20.&nbsp;Current S&amp;P 500 PE Ratio is over 30. So the most short term risk from artificial intelligence is not some version of the Terminator, but what is politely called a "stock market correction", where investors realize that AI isn\'t going to pay out *that* fast, and stock prices drop a lot, because suddenly more people are trying to sell their overpriced AI shares than there are people wanting to buy them. And that also affects people who simply invested in ETFs, or who have money in a 401k pension plan. That is not to say that AI isn\'t a technology that will make money in the future, it just might take longer, or the profits will go to different companies than investors think today. Just like the dot com bubble burst, and the internet is doing fine, the AI bubble can burst while AI still has a bright future.

Especially games that don\'t just sell on artistic appeal, but on gameplay. We don\'t need to live in a world where half of the indie games are using pixel art. And I am sure that generative AI could also be used to turn interesting art from human artists into video game animations at much lower cost than today. I would rather see games competing on their merits on platforms like Steam without the gatekeeping of big budget artwork.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/6126267731058331676/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/6126267731058331676', 'title': '3 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6126267731058331676'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6126267731058331676'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-gatekeeping-of-big-budgets.html', 'title': 'The gatekeeping of big budgets'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '3'}

Not the chance to get struck by lightning, it is around that number, although it obviously depends a lot on where and how you live. A link between carrying a mobile phone and getting cancer has been discussed, but the chance to get cancer is higher than the chance to get struck by lightning, and the possible increase to that chance is so low as to be considered not scientifically proven. Right now, in the EU official classification, mobile phones are in the same category of increased cancer risk as pickles.

This week in the news is a possible link between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and the child being born with autism. In the United States the probability of a child being born with autism is estimated to be 1 in 36. That is certainly higher than a century ago, but it is unclear whether this is due to external factors like Tylenol, or simply to an increased awareness of autism. Now there are scientific studies that link Tylenol to autism, and there are scientific studies that show no such link. Just as there are scientific studies that link glyphosate to&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and there being scientific studies that show no such link.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The difference now being that these things have been politicised, and in the USA a Republican would be more likely to believe in the link between Tylenol and autism, while a Democrat would be more likely to believe in the link between glyphosate and&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It should be obvious that this isn\'t how probability or science works. But humans are notoriously bad with probabilities. And thus anything that science would consider to be an event of low probability can find its way into our belief systems. If you thought my example of a mobile phone getting you struck by lightning was ridiculous, how about the belief that it was your sins that would get you struck by lightning? That was pretty wide spread in humanity over many different cultures and religions. And our belief systems are evolving away from being religious to being political. Especially in two-party systems like the USA, party affiliation today has a stronger influence on what you believe to be true than your religious affiliation.</div><div><br /></div><div>For all questions of "does product X causes undesirable outcome Y", I would urge you to consider that whatever you read might be a result of political bias. You still should ask the relevant scientific question of how high the probability of undesirable outcome X is with and without product X. How strong or weak is the link? If the probability is relatively high to start with, and increases only by a small amount, how justified would it be to sue the producer of product X for damages? Although in a legal system where the probability of getting over 1 million dollars in a lawsuit is higher than the probability of winning 1 million dollars in the lottery, scientific proof is maybe the last thing you want.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'Imagine that your probability of getting struck by lightning is 1 in a million in a given year.

Just as there are scientific studies that link glyphosate to&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and there being scientific studies that show no such link.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The difference now being that these things have been politicised, and in the USA a Republican would be more likely to believe in the link between Tylenol and autism, while a Democrat would be more likely to believe in the link between glyphosate and&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It should be obvious that this isn\'t how probability or science works. But humans are notoriously bad with probabilities. And thus anything that science would consider to be an event of low probability can find its way into our belief systems. If you thought my example of a mobile phone getting you struck by lightning was ridiculous, how about the belief that it was your sins that would get you struck by lightning? That was pretty wide spread in humanity over many different cultures and religions. And our belief systems are evolving away from being religious to being political. Especially in two-party systems like the USA, party affiliation today has a stronger influence on what you believe to be true than your religious affiliation.</div><div><br /></div><div>For all questions of "does product X causes undesirable outcome Y", I would urge you to consider that whatever you read might be a result of political bias. You still should ask the relevant scientific question of how high the probability of undesirable outcome X is with and without product X. How strong or weak is the link? If the probability is relatively high to start with, and increases only by a small amount, how justified would it be to sue the producer of product X for damages? Although in a legal system where the probability of getting over 1 million dollars in a lawsuit is higher than the probability of winning 1 million dollars in the lottery, scientific proof is maybe the last thing you want.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/4166210046328438336/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/4166210046328438336', 'title': '6 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/4166210046328438336'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/4166210046328438336'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/science-probability-and-political-bias.html', 'title': 'Science, probability and political bias'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '6'}

In my defense, some of the thinking afterward warranted a bit of a cooling off period to be better informed, but now it’s time.</p>\n<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>\n<p>Waaaaay back when I first started this adventure, I wrote about <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-goals/" title="Blaugust 2025: Goals | Blog | Nik Kantar">what I was hoping to get out of it</a>. In short, I primarily wanted to write more consistently, and presumably publish more frequently as a result. Has that actually happened in the time since? Well, yes and no.</p>\n<p>Yes, because I’ve certainly been writing and publishing more than in the literal <em>eleven months</em> preceding the challenge, when I wrote and published <em>zero posts</em>. But also no, because I haven’t been particularly consistent.</p>\n<p>Blaugust was a lot of work for me, and involved quite a bit of sacrificing of other things in my life. Don’t worry; none were catastrophic, but by the end I felt significant relief that I could stop, and I think I needed a bit of a break. I’m feeling more inspired to get back to it now, so I think it’s at least a partial win.</p>\n<h2 id="achievements">Achievements</h2>\n<p>As <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/10/blaugust-2025-is-coming/" title="Blaugust 2025 is Coming! – Nerd Girl Thoughts">Krikket outlined</a> at the beginning, Blaugust comes with some lighthearted achievements. I qualified for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Newbie Blogger Award</strong> — awarded to first-time Blaugust participants</li>\n<li><strong>Rainbow Diamond Award</strong> — awarded to those posting 31 or more posts during August</li>\n<li><strong>Community Builder Award</strong> — awarded to those meeting at least three of the following criteria:<ul>\n<li>minumum Silver Award post count (15) — ✔️</li>\n<li>at least 5 posts directly inspired by another Blaugust participant, with links to original posts — if we were to count link roundups (<a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-1/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 1 | Blog | Nik Kantar">1</a>, <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-2/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 2 | Blog | Nik Kantar">2</a>, <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-3/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 3 | Blog | Nik Kantar">3</a>, <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/10/blaugust-2025-links-part-4/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 4 | Blog | Nik Kantar">4</a>), I’d check this one too</li>\n<li>weekly engagement with other Blaugust participants, via reading, commenting, discussing on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/KAXgK2E" title="Join the official Blaugust Discord server">Discord</a>, or sharing on social media — ✔️</li>\n<li>guest post on another Blaugust participant’s blog or vice versa — antithetical  to my <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-no-comments/" title="Blaugust 2025: No Comment(s) | Blog | Nik Kantar">thoughts on comments</a></li>\n<li>create or join a group project — ✔️</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’d say I did a pretty kick-ass job.</p>\n<p><img alt="Blaugust 2025 achievements" src="https://nkantar.com/static/media/2025/10/blaugust-2025-achievements.png" /></p>\n<h2 id="community">Community</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The real treasure was the friends we made along the way.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I jest, but it’s true. My favorite part of Blaugust was reading the flurry of posts everyone was sharing on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/KAXgK2E" title="Join the official Blaugust Discord server">Discord</a>, talking about them on there, responding to them in my own posts, and looking forward to reading what increasingly familiar names wrote day to day. It’s definitely gotten quieter after the conclusion, naturally, but I still check in from time to time.</p>\n<p>A few blogs made it onto my <a href="https://nkantar.com/blogroll/" title="Blogroll | Nik Kantar">blogroll</a> already, but I need to go through the aforementioned link posts and add a few more. And I think I’ll go through the <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/08/27/blaugust-motivation-where-do-all-these-words-come-from/#:~:text=Here%20is%20the%20list%20if%20you%20want%20to%20go%20find%20out%3A" title="Blaugust Motivation – Where Do All These Words Come From? | The Ancient Gaming Noob">full list</a> at some point as well and see if any strike a chord with me.</p>\n<p>I’m still on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/KAXgK2E" title="Join the official Blaugust Discord server">Discord</a> server, though I haven’t participated much since the finale. Sometimes it’s hard to keep up with all the various communities, but the Blaugust one is up there, and I don’t want to just go fully silent.</p>\n<h2 id="again">Again?</h2>\n<p>So, will I do it again next year? I genuinely don’t know. Getting the full 31 posts was a lot, and I’m not eager to skimp on sleep and whatever else to get that again, so maybe I need to set myself a lower goal, and perhaps have some ideas (and notes?) ahead of time. Or maybe I just keep doing what I’m doing and play along that way—the community was just as welcoming to those who only eked out a few posts as it was to me and my full slate.</p>\n<p>Maybe I’ll choose a listicle-like theme, like “31 small Python libraries I love”. Maybe I’ll do something silly like <em>only</em> writing posts in response to others’. Posting more of a daily journal/diary could be fun, too. The possibilities are nearly literally endless!</p>\n<p>I think it’s highly unlikely I won’t participate at all. Regardless of how much of my own writing finds its way onto published pages, I expect I’ll be keeping a close eye on what others post at least.</p>\n<p>And yes, you should totally play along. If you do, I’ll play along with you. 😉</p>'}]}

Inspired—and admittedly slightly indignant, perhaps—I thought “surely I can make this happen” and registered <code>pybeach.org</code> before I’d even left the Bay Area.</p>\n<p>A little over two years later, on February 29th, 2020, <a href="https://2020.pybeach.org/" title="PyBeach 2020: Saturday, February 29, 2020, Los Angeles, California">PyBeach 2020</a> happened, with  plenty of community support, but still primarily as my baby. It was a great time, with around 40 attendees present for a day of fantastic talks, and the plan was to keep going. Since the event happened on a leap day, I obviously joked along the lines of “that was a lot of work, so maybe I’ll see y’all back in four years”, and I deeply apologize if I manifested what subsequently transpired.</p>\n<p>As hosting in-person events started becoming at least somewhat sensible from 2023 or thereabouts, I’d wanted to bring PyBeach back. Organizing a conference is indeed quite a bit of work, and it all starts with a venue and dates, with everything else subject to that combination. As I vaguely attempted to solve that problem on my own for over a year, <a href="https://2025.pybeach.org/organizers.html" title="PyBeach 2025">two awesome people</a> in the Python world got in touch and wanted to get involved.</p>\n<p>We started as a triumvirate, but over the ensuing months, <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2023/11/masking-is-inclusivity/#why-i-care" title="Masking Is Inclusivity | Blog | Nik Kantar">personal circumstances</a> rendered me disproportionally unhelpful. After much stressing over letting them down, I decided the best thing I could do was to officially hand over the reigns and get out of their way, so I did just that.</p>\n<p>They kept running with it and put on a kick-ass event. <a href="https://2025.pybeach.org/" title="PyBeach 2025">PyBeach 2025</a> happened on September 27th, and it was a blast.</p>\n<h2 id="the-event">The Event</h2>\n<p>PyBeach 2025 was <em>awesome</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt="PyBeach 2025 schedule of events" src="https://nkantar.com/static/media/2025/09/pybeach-2025-schedule.jpg" title="PyBeach 2025 schedule of events" /></p>\n<p>The talks were fantastic, and I kept overhearing people referencing them throughout the day. I watched a few, and really appreciated <a href="https://www.willingconsulting.com/" title="Willing Consulting">Carol Willing’s</a> opening keynote about asking questions. The slate that followed was of the highest caliber. The talks were recorded using the venue’s setup, and the viability of the recordings is still unknown, but if they make their way to the public, you should give them a watch. I know I will for the ones I missed.</p>\n<p>The <del>hallway</del> lobby track was exciting and lively. I got to chat with some old acquaintances and make new ones. This is arguably my favorite part of every conference, and it delivered.</p>\n<p>The food track was also top notch. The dinner the night before the event, lunch, and dinner after all involved excellent company to go with great food and drinks. Santa Monica fortunately has plenty of great dining options, so we were well covered. And as much as I appreciate the thought behind being fed, I tend to strongly prefer eating out around the event whenever possible, so I get to experience the locale a bit.</p>\n<p>The vibe was awesome. This energy is why I go to conferences—around twenty by now—and why I started one. It’s why I got involved with organizing <a href="https://socalpython.org/" title="SoCal Python | The official site of the Los Angeles Python programming language community.">SoCal Python</a>, and why I want it to come back. In my eyes a well-run event lets the people present make it great, and this was a shining example.</p>\n<h2 id="the-feelings">The Feelings</h2>\n<p><img alt="my PyBeach 2025 badge" src="https://nkantar.com/static/media/2025/09/pybeach-2025-badge.jpg" title="my PyBeach 2025 badge" /></p>\n<p>Early in the day I <a href="https://nkantar.social/@nik/115277491693541529#." title="Nik Kantar :pybeach:: &quot;Many feelings today, all posit…&quot; - nkantar.social">tooted</a> a photo of my badge with the “Volunteer” ribbon and captioned it with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Many feelings today, all positive.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was a pretty emotional experience to be involved and see the event flourish.</p>\n<p>At <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2018/" title="PyCon 2018 in Cleveland, Ohio | May 9-17">PyCon 2018</a> I was in a community organizing open space, and someone said “your conference can be 40 people in a room”. I took this wisdom to heart, and PyBeach 2020 was just that. I basically wanted a conference that’s convenient for me and serves Southern California. If it had remained “40 people in a room” forever, it still would’ve been great. To see it double was gratifying in a way I didn’t anticipate.</p>\n<p>It was also extremely gratifying to see it thrive “without me”, so to speak. I helped a little bit with the t-shirts, assembled one of the Corsi-Rosenthal boxes, staffed the registration desk for part of the afternoon, and helped with the cleanup. While that’s not nothing, it’s also not even a little bit like organizing, and anyone could’ve done it instead.</p>\n<p>There was something special in seeing a thing I started take a life of its own and grow, through hard work and care of others. There is perhaps no better testament to the value of said thing and the power of the community than this happening, and it is my proudest professional achievement.</p>\n<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>\n<p>I don’t know if and when the next PyBeach will happen. The organizers expressed interest in not doing it again all by themselves, and I hope someone else will step up. I also hope to continue to be involved, but don’t want to try taking on more than I can handle, especially as the personal side of my life isn’t really changing for the better. I remember during the lead-up to the original event thinking that it would be nice if PyBeach traveled—as <a href="https://www.pycascades.com/" title="Home — PyCascades">PyCascades</a> does between Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland—primarily with <a href="https://www.sandiegopython.org/" title="Home · San Diego Python">San Diego Python</a> in mind, but we also have Orange County, Ventura, and Santa Barbara roughly within the same geographic area, so there are some other candidates for that approach as well.</p>\n<p>And if it doesn’t pan out, it will be a shame, but I’ll be proud of the role I played in what this community I so dearly love made happen twice.</p>\n<p>But I think we can figure something out. And I hope to see you there.</p>\n<p><img alt="presentation slide with the PyBeach logo and caption enjoy the ride" src="https://nkantar.com/static/media/2025/09/pybeach-2025-enjoy-the-ride.jpg" title="enjoy the ride" /></p>'}]}

This someone could’ve easily been myself a month ago.</p>\n<h2 id="pre-write">Pre-Write</h2>\n<p>I was more interested in building a solid writing habit than specifically publishing a bunch of content, so I started off writing and posting on the same day. This went fine for maybe a couple of weeks, but eventually Life™ got a little tricky, and I found myself writing the day before publishing, which still had the same effect. Ultimately I ended up with a few non-writing days here and there, which is a pretty great result overall.</p>\n<p>I really liked writing the day/night before and publishing in the morning, and if I were to do this again with this same goal of writing consistently, I’d strive for that. But that’s a pretty intense schedule for someone trying to squeeze this in after work, family, and other obligations, so doing a bit more pre-writing is probably more sustainable. Writing enough on the weekend to skip two or three weekdays during the following week sounds like a good approach.</p>\n<h2 id="stash-easy-ideas">Stash Easy Ideas</h2>\n<p>Publishing an easy one here and there is nothing to be ashamed of, I think. The <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/iphone-home-screen-tour/" title="iPhone Home Screen Tour | Blog | Nik Kantar">home screen tour</a> and <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-the-blog-questions-challenge/" title="Blaugust 2025: The Blog Questions Challenge | Blog | Nik Kantar">blog questions challenge</a> come to mind. I’d decided to do these each a few days before I actually did, and had them at the ready for days when I couldn’t write anything more substantial. I did my best to make them worthwhile, but recognize they were essentially little “breaks”.</p>\n<h2 id="lower-your-standards">Lower Your Standards</h2>\n<p>Now, to be clear, I’m not suggesting you throw your standards in the trash wholesale. That would be a bummer, and likely not a price worth paying just to stick to the schedule.</p>\n<p>I’m merely suggesting you consider allowing yourself to publish posts you might not think are your absolute best, or even posts you think you could improve, which you probably could, but there’s only so much time, so don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Sometimes a <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-regressed-expectations/" title="Blaugust 2025: Regressed Expectations | Blog | Nik Kantar">mostly baked thought</a> is OK and you’ll be forgiven for foisting it upon your readers.</p>\n<h2 id="revisit-old-ideas">Revisit Old Ideas</h2>\n<p>If you have old ideas you wanted to write about, this could be a great opportunity to dust them off. I found the pressure of not having all that much time to be a great motivator to let go of the notion that these old notes or drafts might turn into something truly world changing and just publish <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-stop-pleasing-deathbed-you/" title="Blaugust 2025: Stop Pleasing Deathbed You | Blog | Nik Kantar">something decent</a>.</p>\n<h2 id="play-along">Play Along</h2>\n<p>Participating in group projects is great. I hadn’t really ever done anything like it before, and it was a fun experience. For me the prompts solved half of my usual problem—what to write about—letting me figure out the answer. It was also super fun to read others’ takes on the same day, generally after posting mine. I got to post some <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-all-about-that-bassline/" title="Blaugust 2025: All About That Bass(line) | Blog | Nik Kantar">music</a>, a <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-low-stakes-hot-take/" title="Blaugust 2025: Low Stakes Hot Take | Blog | Nik Kantar">hot take</a>, and a <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-small-joys-big-smiles/" title="Blaugust 2025: Small Joys, Big Smiles | Blog | Nik Kantar">screen recording of a game</a> as a result, none of which I would’ve done on my own.</p>\n<h2 id="blog-back">Blog Back</h2>\n<p>In addition to planned group projects, I found it fun to just <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/digital-and-analog-writing/" title="Digital and Analog Writing | Blog | Nik Kantar">respond to others’ posts</a>. This is especially great if the original author doesn’t have comments on their blog, which tends to be quite a few people, myself included. I stand by <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-no-comments/" title="Blaugust 2025: No Comment(s) | Blog | Nik Kantar">my reasons</a>, but will almost certainly want to read any post inspired by my own.</p>\n<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>\n<p>The <a href="https://discord.com/invite/VyJAnQ8Bhg" title="Blaugust Discord server">official Blaugust Discord server</a> is pretty great. I’ve immensely enjoyed conversing with other participants in real-time(ish), and the energy has helped me keep going when things got a bit dicey a few times. The community is lovely and helpful. Bonus: this is where I found the group projects.</p>\n<h2 id="let-it-go">Let It Go</h2>\n<p>This one is perhaps hypocritical, since I definitely sacrificed some sleep to the gods of consistency, but it’s OK not to hit all 31 (or however many you targeted) posts. It really is. You won’t be less of a person, whether you skip some days intentionally or unintentionally. Blaugust is ostensibly about posting 31 times in 31 days, but deep down it’s about what <em>actually</em> works for you, and you get to decide that. Plenty of people haven’t hit their original goal, and that’s totally fine.</p>\n<h2 id="break-the-streak">Break the Streak</h2>\n<p>I’m intentionally breaking the streak on September 1st to avoid it becoming unhealthy.

If you would like to share your memories of Michael, please do the same.</p>\n<p>My contribution is presented below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Michael and I met in 2017, when I started attending SoCal Python meetups. Pretty soon he brought me under his wing as a co-organizer, and over the ensuing years we and others organized many SoCal Python events together, and even the inaugural PyBeach conference. His helpfulness and influence on everything he contributed to are hard to overstate. He was engaged in many other communities as well, and it’s no secret or surprise that many people active in them knew him and appreciated his work.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in there Michael and I became friends as well. I don’t know if he knew how to operate in any other way, and I think that line was rather blurred for him in general, since he always sought ways to help other people. The number of times I’ve witnessed him introduce two people to each other is beyond any count, and that’s basically what he was about: making connections. These connections lead to job opportunities, friendships, and who knows what else.</p>\n<p>The Southern California Python community has lost one of its major champions, and he will be greatly missed. Rest in peace, goodwill.</p>\n<p>— Nik Kantar, May 2025</p>\n</blockquote>'}]}

And speaking of firing, I was lucky enough to keep my job, and my employer was lucky enough to keep the customer.</p>\n<p>I won’t be naming any names here—except my own, obviously—so some details of the story have been changed to protect both the innocent and the guilty. I also don’t have the exact code, so you’ll have to suspend a bit of disbelief.</p>\n<p>I was working at a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" title="Software as a service - Wikipedia">SaaS</a> company where I didn’t have access to the production database (which actually describes most of my résumé). One of our customers had imported data into the platform, and much of the source text was entirely lowercase. Some of the data fields were things like names, where capitalization would be expected, so the experience really wasn’t ideal. We wanted to do them a solid by fixing it, because we were awesome like that—and because they asked us to do so—and I was tasked with creating a quick and dirty solution.</p>\n<p>The approach I came up with was reasonable, I think: I wrote a Python script that would read the table in question and write <code>UPDATE</code> SQL statements with values run through <code>str.capitalize()</code>—easy enough! There were quite a few columns, so I iterated through them, which Python makes super easy.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, I don’t have this snippet available, but it probably looked something like this (with the rows being queried from the DB):</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">COLUMNS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;person_name&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;company&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;category&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>\n\n<span class="n">rows</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>\n    <span class="p">{</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">313</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;person_name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;nik kantar&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;company&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;acme inc.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;count&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;status&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;legit&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;category&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;oopsies&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n    <span class="p">},</span>\n    <span class="p">{</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1024</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;person_name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ada lovelace&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;company&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;acme inc.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;count&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">24</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;status&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;legit&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;category&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;also oopsies&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n    <span class="p">},</span>\n    <span class="p">{</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">9001</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;person_name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;margaret hamilton&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;company&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;not acme inc.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;count&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;status&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;super legit&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;category&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;also oopsies&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n    <span class="p">},</span>\n<span class="p">]</span>\n\n<span class="n">statements</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>\n\n<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">rows</span><span class="p">:</span>\n    <span class="n">statement</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;UPDATE very_important_table SET &quot;</span>\n\n    <span class="n">updates</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>\n    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">column</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">COLUMNS</span><span class="p">:</span>\n        <span class="n">original_value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">column</span><span class="p">]</span>\n        <span class="n">parts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">original_value</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;

I ran the script, it generated the SQL, I ran that on the DB, and verified the results.</p>\n<p>Empowered by this massive success, I sent the Python script to the person who was going to run it on production data. They went through the process, but were too preoccupied to validate the changes on the spot, which wasn’t ideal, but our confidence about this fairly simple transformation was high.</p>\n<p>That is until a few moments later, when someone at the company told us they couldn’t access the single most important page in the product—powered by this very table—while logged in as that customer. <em>Uh-oh…</em></p>\n<p>A little bit later the person with access to production data was able to take a look, and, uhh, it wasn’t great: the table was full of values based on column names—that is, the <code>person_name</code> column had <code>&quot;Person_name&quot;</code> for every entry we updated, <code>company</code> was <code>&quot;Company&quot;</code>, and so on.</p>\n<p>It turned out that I did the equivalent of <code>original_value = column</code> instead of <code>original_value = row[column]</code> in whatever syntax I actually used. Such an easy mistake to make…but wait, didn’t I test this?!</p>\n<p>Well…yes, I did. But my test data was pretty awful. I was working with values extremely close to column names, like <code>&quot;person name&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;company&quot;</code>, so my sleepy eyes glazed over the differences. And my partner in crime didn’t verify the generated SQL before running it, since it was a lot more verbose and illegible than the sample above.</p>\n<p>We were very fortunate to have a backup recent enough that no changes to customer data had been made since. I fixed the script, we were able to run it on the backup table, and everything was fine.</p>\n<p>Ever since I’ve tried my best to use at least slightly more representative test data.

Fortunately the <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/25/blaugust-2025-calendar-weekly-prompts/" title="Blaugust 2025 – Calendar &amp; Weekly Prompts – Nerd Girl Thoughts">prompts</a> are here to help! Today I’m tackling the entire “Staying Motivated” week’s worth, since I don’t really think expanding each into its own post would go all that well for me.</p>\n<h2 id="what-tricks-do-you-use-to-keep-yourself-motivated-when-something-feels-impossible">What tricks do you use to keep yourself motivated when something feels impossible?</h2>\n<p>I don’t know that I have any general tricks, per se. I think I tend to bang my head against the wall in hopes the wall won’t be the one to prevail. I’d like to say that I think to myself “not trying guarantees failure, keep at it” or something equally poetic, but I’m not sure if that’s true. I definitely have a tendency to sacrifice sleep to get something done, though, and that strategy is only getting worse with age.</p>\n<p>Specific to Blaugust, though, the streak—which is <em>absolutely</em> a double-edged sword—has been astoundingly effective.</p>\n<h2 id="what-are-your-blogging-goals-do-you-think-participating-in-blaugust-is-getting-you-closer-to-where-you-want-be">What are your blogging goals? Do you think participating in Blaugust is getting you closer to where you want be?</h2>\n<p>I wanted to kickstart writing more, as I wrote in the <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-intro/" title="Blaugust 2025: Intro | Blog | Nik Kantar">intro post</a>. Given how well I’ve done at consistently writing about <em>something</em>, I’m quite optimistic about settling into a more reasonable cadence after the blognanza ends. I think that if I found a few hours every week to do some sort of writing, and published something worthwhile on average more than once per month, I’d be pretty stoked, and that feels very doable.</p>\n<h2 id="what-do-you-think-youll-get-out-of-completing-your-blaugust-goals">What do you think you’ll get out of completing your Blaugust goals?</h2>\n<p>The completionist in me is <em>beyond excited</em> to get <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/10/blaugust-2025-is-coming/" title="Blaugust 2025 is Coming! – Nerd Girl Thoughts">all the badges</a>, for sure. And the rest of me hopes that the hangup of only wanting to post epic pieces is significantly weakened, and I can just post what I want to post, even if it doesn’t stand a real chance of changing the world, which the forced “lower quality” of some of my Blaugust posts ought to achieve.</p>\n<h2 id="what-drives-you-to-blog">What drives you to blog?</h2>\n<p>Frankly, I’m not entirely sure.</p>\n<p>I’ve always enjoyed writing, first in Serbian and then in English. I used to read like a fiend, too.</p>\n<p>As I got older, I effectively stopped reading, and I’ve been trying to pick it back up for years, but it’s hard. For whatever reason, however, I kept writing. It’s mostly been blogging, but I also journal, write as much software documentation as I can justify, and generally enjoy typing things of all sorts.</p>\n<h2 id="are-you-happy-with-your-blaugust-so-far-if-so-why-if-not-why-not">Are you happy with your Blaugust so far? If so, why? If not, why not?</h2>\n<p>I’m <em>absolutely, positively thrilled</em>. This is the 26th post on the 26th day, and I’m immensely proud of myself for keeping it up, but also for keeping in mind that this pace is unsustainable and undesirable in the long run, and that I will adjust it as soon as we’re done here.</p>\n<p>10/10, no notes.</p>\n<h2 id="how-important-is-goal-setting-reaching-your-goals-to-you-overall">How important is goal setting &amp; reaching your goals to you overall?</h2>\n<p>Ha, I used to set <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/tags/goals/" title="Tag: goals | Nik Kantar">goals</a> of this sort regularly, and in the end it didn’t seem to make much difference. I’m sure the vague scope and expansive time frame of those was generally unhelpful, so I think that serves better as an example of what <em>not</em> to do than something that may lead to success.</p>\n<p>Hefty as the daily posting goal for Blaugust is, it’s made it very top-of-mind. I think goals only make sense if one doesn’t literally forget them, which I’ve done plenty with the aforementioned ones I’ve posted about here.</p>\n<p>I think I can take some lessons from Blaugust and apply them elsewhere, namely to scope my goals tighter in general.</p>\n<h2 id="did-you-read-any-posts-during-blaugust-or-before-that-you-found-particularly-inspirational-share-them">Did you read any posts during Blaugust (or before) that you found particularly inspirational? Share them!</h2>\n<p>I sure did, and I shared them <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-1/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 1 | Blog | Nik Kantar">three</a> <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-2/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 2 | Blog | Nik Kantar">times</a> <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-3/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 3 | Blog | Nik Kantar">already</a>.

I&#8217;m through two of the five books in the bundle I bought already, and I can tell I&#8217;ll be getting the rest. It&#8217;s a bit of an interesting spin on the genre, too, being set in &#8216;Depression era&#8217; New York, but where magic of various forms has taken the place of certain aspects of technology developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m torn on having Goodreads count it as a single book though.

I&#8217;m convinced the first cave-teenager to suffer a break-up took to banging rocks together in a rhythmically satisfying way, rather than talking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could absolutely have been that cave-teenager. Finding music that resonates with the soul, or at least the big feelings of the moment, is cathartic in a way almost nothing else can be. Even if it does take a bit of mental gymnastics to make every line fit your situation sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a>. You may&#8217;ve heard of it &#8212; but if not, it&#8217;s an AI that can create songs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d heard of it before. But honestly? I had simply assumed it&#8217;d be little more than a toy. Somewhere along the line I got the idea you had to provide your own vocals, and the AI just acted like a souped-up auto-tune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>can</em> use it like that, sure. But you can also simply write your own lyrics and have it go at it. Heck &#8212; if you&#8217;d rather, you don&#8217;t even need to do that. Just describe what you want, like any other LLM, and it&#8217;ll spit out your response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only this time it comes with a soundtrack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://suno.com/s/YfVE4FBgRpdZWnZF"><em>Shadows and Neon</em></a> is one such created in this way. I could not have expended any less effort on it if I <em>tried</em>. I can&#8217;t even recall what my prompt was, but I know I didn&#8217;t even bother prompting for specific styles. I just wasn&#8217;t invested yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it made me sit up and pay attention because I couldn&#8217;t hand on heart tell you I&#8217;d definitely have identified it as AI-generated if I hadn&#8217;t just clicked the &#8216;Create&#8217; button myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thus Starts my Crash Course in Song Construction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I <em>like</em> music, I couldn&#8217;t have told you a few days ago what a &#8216;prechorus&#8217; was (beyond the obvious), or what precisely a &#8216;bridge&#8217; is meant to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of this learning was just feeding in basic prompts and seeing what came out, but I also took a bit of a stab at seeing if I knew enough to take inspiration from other, much better, songs and seeing if Suno could get me anywhere close. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was even reading song and album reviews for crying out loud. It was a bit like learning a new language adjacent to, but not quite the same as the one you&#8217;re native to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/jJSVX5qAs2KcYbK6">What Never Relents</a></em> is one such attempt, where I was looking to see if I could craft a style prompt to hit a similar feel to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUe9UhcUtEI">Specter by Bad Omens</a></em>. It does tickle me that the generated lyrics here used &#8216;Specter&#8217; without specifically being prompted to or given the lyric directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not an unqualified success (particularly not on the vocal stylings), I was, once again, somewhat impressed. And I hadn&#8217;t even realised that you could enfold section-specific direction to vocals and music in the lyrics as well yet!<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-1-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-65184" title="I mean, it will ignore you completely 9 times out of 10, but still, you can!"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Toy to Therapist</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point, a switch flicked. Don’t ask me how or why &#8212; I couldn’t tell you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I do know is that I realised I’d still been treating Suno as a toy, when it was clearly more than that. So… I did something I haven’t done in <em>many</em> years.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-2-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65184" title="Probably not since I was that rock-bashing cave-teen myself."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote something like poetry — only this time, I had a way to give it a soundtrack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we call those songs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because she’d been on my mind a lot lately, I wrote one about my mother. Let me tell you &#8212; I was <em>not</em> ready to hear the words sung back at me. Jesus H. Christ. I&#8217;m uncertain what context to give. Perhaps none, and leave it to what I&#8217;ve already <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/goodbye-mum/">said in the past</a>. Songs are meant to speak for themselves anyway, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hit me harder than I expected. Harder than I was ready for. And yet, I kept working on it. It took a fair bit of finessing of lyrics and style guides to get where I wanted it &#8212; and Suno really does not like being told what to do if you introduce the concept of a second voice &#8212; but I ultimately found my way to this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/zQ6jTxGIw1ClJRnT">The Weight of Love</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s still a sombre piece overall, the more I tweaked, the more small notes of light started slipping in. Verse 3, for example, wasn’t in the first draft at all &#8212; it only emerged as I kept writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, for starters, I think I finally get why some albums feel like they’re circling one idea over and over. Apparently, when something matters, you don’t just&#8230; wring it out in a single track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So of course I had to do another. I had more work through here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just like that, I think I&#8217;m on the path to just creating a whole (virtual) album. Whodathunk? Certainly not me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not blind to the issues such AI technologies pose, whichever side of the fence you sit on. I can&#8217;t say I know how ethically the models have been trained (but&#8230; I could guess). Nor do I relish a future where the world is drowning in &#8216;AI Slop&#8217; in the music field as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the transition of considering Suno from Toy to Therapist is perhaps telling of my perspective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to spell it out; I don’t think anything I make with it should soar to the top of the charts, or replace the work of genuinely talented artists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as something personal — a way to process, to experiment, to speak feelings I’d struggle to put into words otherwise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s powerful stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first cave-teenager banged rocks together to make sense of big feelings. I guess I’m doing the same, only now the rocks have been swapped for an algorithm and a pair of headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bonus Track</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/hjZv4nd55jkbFif0">Remember Me (That Way)</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second (made, but maybe not in final placement) track from this hypothetical album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honouring Mum&#8217;s request for how she wished to be remembered &#8212; but without burying the truth for those left behind, either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a trickier one to land, asking Suno to balance minor and major sections to hit the right overall tone. Last night I was <em>just about</em> ready to come to the conclusion Suno simply couldn&#8217;t do it. After changing my approach to the in-lyric style notes and the main style guide, here we go!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/">Accidentally, Songs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com">Time to Loot</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'post-id': '65184'}

My interest has increased the further on I&#8217;ve gone though, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was to point out the key reason for enjoying this one less, it would be the tie-in to real-world, actual history.  I shant elaborate further as to what or when, but I will explain a little more my issue with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it isn&#8217;t the subject matter itself, nor the philosophical or ethical lean Lawrence is aiming for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m on board with all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it removed all subtlety from the proceedings. It no longer asked the reader to think through implications and parallels for themselves and instead became a mallet to the face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strength of fiction, done well, is that whole stimulation of thought. Creating (or perhaps more accurately, finding) the links for yourself. I believe it truly holds the power to change hearts and minds in a way that a raw recounting of history cannot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than that though, no-one enjoys being preached at, even when they already agree with the message. While I wouldn&#8217;t quite accuse Lawrence of that here with the third book, it started feeling like it might toe that line to begin with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all that &#8212; I&#8217;m still more than curious to see where the series ends, and it does little to dampen my enthusiasm for Lawrence as an author on the whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

Beyond that though the decision gets a fair bit trickier. Both FFXIV and Wuthering Waves are doing their darndest to be the one. Wuthering Waves had its 2.6 patch this week, with a character banner I was actually interested in<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-3-65003"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/wuthering-waves/screenshot-saturday-wuthering-waves-2-6-edition/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-65003" title="I haven&amp;#8217;t gone for anyone since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D9K2rz3Uvk&quot;&gt;Cartethyia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=optr9r9VkoQ&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;)"><sup>3</sup></a></span> and what looks to be a finale-feeling storyline for the Rinascita story arc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Although it is possible, actually, that this trailer is representing more than just 2.6. Perhaps a 2.7 is in our future to close out Rinascita. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know yet because I haven&#8217;t actually <em>started</em> the 2.6 Main Story Quest yet, let alone finished it. Actually- that&#8217;s not 100% true. I have done the preamble/character introduction bits, but then paused just shy of getting started <em>properly</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead I&#8217;ve caught up on the Overture quest from 2.5, which, come to think of it, is pretty similar in nature to the between-expansion quest lines of FFXIV. Just&#8230; <em>much</em> shorter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; Alright, I&#8217;ve gone on this long. I was going to outline the case for FFXIV before deciding, but perhaps that can just occupy next week&#8217;s slot! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-columns wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65007" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250828220450_2-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Won Augusta 1st night of the patch!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65008" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250830020819_1-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Did <em>not</em> win weapon first night.

The mindblowing nature of this fact is pretty intense. I realise this. I did warn you though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This truth wasn&#8217;t revealed to me in a dream, but rather while I was writing <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/final-fantasy-xiv/the-far-edge-of-fate/">yesterday&#8217;s post</a>. I was on a deadline, albeit a self-imposed one. I had things to do. &#8230; Thing to do. <em>Alright, geez,</em> I had a game to play. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have our own motivations, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonight I don&#8217;t have quite the same need. I made it through the end of Heavensward, hit credits (<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/final-fantasy-xiv/rolling-credits-on-heavensward/">again</a>), and got the Stormblood title drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-64967" height="529" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250827233112_1-940x529.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV:</em></strong> Passing the Wall, into all new lands.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, I lied, I do have the same need. I want to play more. The start of Stormblood is great so far. Plus! I now know who the lady in red in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt1h1MinlLI">Stormblood trailer</a> is! All these years, and I just assumed she was a class trainer from the expansion. Eesh!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. I&#8217;m getting distracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; If focus is the key, I might be in trouble. ! <em>Althooough</em>, I got distracted <em>while</em> writing this time. So I&#8217;m going to call that progress. Surely it&#8217;s better than stopping mid-post to reply in Discord or Google some random thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I think it might be actually, is channelling that&#8230; <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/writing-comments-vs-posts/">comment writing energy</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The linked post goes into more detail, but as a brief recap if you haven&#8217;t the foggiest what I mean&#8230; Something that&#8217;s true for me, and others, and maybe you&#8217;ll recognise it as well after I explain it, is that writing a post&#8230; Man, that&#8217;s <em>work</em>. It takes time. Serious time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments though? Even if they end up being post-length in nature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Easy</em>. They just flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a whole other part of your brain gets engaged. Or&#8230; Perhaps more accurate to say that in &#8216;comment&#8217; writing, a part of your brain <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> get engaged. Namely, the critic. The editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All to say, I found Wilhelm&#8217;s post today both incredibly timely, <em>and</em> incredibly enlightening, <em>and</em> amusing to boot.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>Basically, the secret to my success is low standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8211; Wilhelm Arcturis (2025), <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/08/27/blaugust-motivation-where-do-all-these-words-come-from/">Blaugust Motivation – Where Do All These Words Come&nbsp;From?</a> (The Ancient Gaming Noob)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And I should also add: accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should take the time to read the post yourself, so I don&#8217;t want to give it all away &#8212; but one last part I can&#8217;t help but to voice agreement with. I have the time to blog more. Write more. It is absolutely a choice to prioritise other pursuits (*cough* games) more often than not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps if I consciously leaned into this style more often, I could have my cake and eat it too&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;Thoughts for another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Games await.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Full List of Blaugust 2025 Participants</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/blaugust-2025-is-here/">little while</a> since I posted the list of Blaugust participants.

And if you look at it funny and kinda squint a little bit, you might stretch me to two and a quarter. Maybe even two and a half &#8212; as the missing game I <em>had</em> played before, at its PlayStation release. I just thought I might pick it up again on PC, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong> is, frankly, amazing. The gameplay trailers we saw in the four years of development often seemed as if coming directly from a game designer&#8217;s fever dream. Such doubts didn&#8217;t stop me in the slightest from feeling an unhealthy degree of hype for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-medium is-resized wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-58475" height="264" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blackmyth-Wukong-470x264.jpg" style="width: 400px;" width="470" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I knew what I was doing, and it was certainly at the back of my mind that it could <em>never</em>.

Turns out, there <em>was</em> a reason my friends and I have played through all three Borderlands games to date, sometimes multiple times! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was with that lens some of the gameplay coming out from content creators grabbed my attention a bunch more, and here we are, considering prioritising it against even Hollow Knight: Silksong!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Battlefield 6 &#8212; 11 October</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/other-games/battlefield-6-open-beta/">The beta</a> was enough to convince my friend group that we want in. It was a <em>blast</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been a while since we have all done a Battlefield game together. We had some interest in 2042 (in fact&#8230; it made an appearance in the <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/gaming/coming-games-of-interest-2021-edition/">Games of Coming Interest &#8212; 2021 Edition</a>), but, uh&#8230; That one didn&#8217;t end up being so good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This seems a real return to form, with destruction on par with what my memories tells me Bad Company 2 had. (And no, I&#8217;m not interested in going back and proving myself wrong or removing my nostalgia goggles. It&#8217;s my favourite!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; This is the second game on the list that has some dependence on Borderlands 4; namely &#8212; are we done with it by the time this rolls around?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If not, perhaps it awaits a sale, or at least the Christmas break.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where Winds Meeting &#8212; 15 November</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell you what game <em>isn&#8217;t</em> dependent on Borderlands 4 though &#8212; it&#8217;s this one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has actually been on my radar for at least a couple of years, I think the Arekkz channel first introduced me to it. What I didn&#8217;t appreciate until quite recently is that it isn&#8217;t just a Singleplayer game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is there co-op, but you can even (optionally) go into a full &#8216;Online&#8217; mode where it is more of an MMO-lite, with world events/bosses, and the whole nine yards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh- it&#8217;s also free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which can be boon or bane; but at least how the devs are talking now &#8212; the monetisation seems restricted to cosmetics only. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a slew of sponsored videos like this one, where there is clearly a desire to build interest in the West before the release later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is coming across as a bit of an &#8216;everything to everyone&#8217; game at the moment, which again&#8230; Could be concerning. But the responses so far seem, on the whole, quite positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So bring on my SP/Co-Op/MMO Wuxia Souls-Like Action Combat Life Sim game! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Borderlands 4 and Where Winds Meet are the two definites on this list. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There isn&#8217;t a world in which those two get missed. Although if I had been forced to choose between the two&#8230; I think it would be Borderlands 4 that got the boot, honestly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other two are trickier to call. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I would say that I reckon even should Hollow Knight: Silksong ride the deferral bus for a bit, I&#8217;m much more likely to circle back to it. Battlefield 6 on the other hand, if we let that one slide now&#8230; Eh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe we pick it up on a sale somewhere down the line?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guess we&#8217;ll see when the next one of these comes around!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

I had already gone far enough last time to be into the 3.3 content, and end the major conflict of the expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I returned, I was on the MSQ (Main Story Quest) titled &#8216;Choices&#8217;, which had a bit of &#8216;Anime Beach Day&#8217; energy to it, albeit with far less fan service. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-64854" height="529" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250823225638_1-940x529.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mission was to bring the various city-states together in a Grand Melee, as a sign of breaking Ishgard out of its previously insular footing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was actually fairly impressed that the melee itself had some systems attached. Simple ones, sure &#8212; but more than I expected. The winner is first to 100 points, where any regular soldier is worth just 1 point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, each side will always have one fighter marked by a beam, indicating they are worth 10. You need to take down their big point targets while protecting your own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And</em>, the whole thing culminates in a boss battle which I shan&#8217;t spoil, although I do I have to admit&#8230; *cough* &#8230;it took me a few tries. Because I <em>thought</em> it was a simple DPS race (I was <em>very</em> close to achieving it this way), but I was underestimating the game again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a mechanic there which needed to be respected. Again, not complex, nothing you wouldn&#8217;t have seen before even within FFXIV up until that point.

Cyberpunk 2077, for all its launch faults, is in fine form now. It wasn&#8217;t abandoned or given bare minimum technical touch-ups. Instead, it had literal <em>years</em> of additional development effort put in to make it sing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bring it up in the context of a brilliant post by <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/">Frostilyte</a>, asking the question: &#8220;<a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/18/is-it-wrong-to-support-grounded-2-in-early-access/">Should <em>Grounded 2</em> even be <em>allowed</em> to utilise <em>Early Access</em>?</a>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My title probably spoils this, but: <em><strong>yes</strong></em>. Not only <em>should</em> Grounded 2 be &#8216;allowed,&#8217; I wish more big titles had the guts to wear the Early Access label when it fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyberpunk sure should have. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, gamers were left feeling anything &#8212; or everything &#8212; from frustration to disappointment, or even betrayal. Slap the EA badge on it and suddenly? The consumer transparency preserves a mountain of goodwill and space to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281" height="461" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190826000049_1-830x461.jpg" width="830" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>No Man&#8217;s Sky</em></strong>: Another example where the &#8216;Early Access&#8217; tag really should&#8217;ve been applied.

Although I would hope not a controversial one: <em>If, for whatever reason, you&#8217;re not going to finish the game before putting it out, maybe at least be honest about this fact.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Frostilyte had more than just us consumers in mind. He was interested in watching out for the Indies, and that&#8217;s where the debate perhaps gets a little more complicated. Early Access was, after all, born as an indie lifeline — a way to keep the lights on and build community while development continued. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It provided a path that maybe <em>didn&#8217;t</em> ask Indies to re-mortgage their house in trade for a year of development time in the hopes of not (literally) losing it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when AAA shows up in that space, the worry is whether it tilts the field even further against the smallest studios. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-53598" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CS2Header-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Cities: Skylines 2:</em></strong> Even now, this one should still be wearing an Early Access badge.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And from that concern, there are a couple of additional paths beyond consumer transparency that my mind goes down, but neither of them changes my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>Indies and AAA <em>already</em> co-exist; and Indies aren&#8217;t just catering to a small niche of interest any more.</strong><br />Indies and AAA&#8217;s already co-exist in the market today, having broadened from a once scrappy niche with only occasional breakouts to something with a higher degree of awareness in the gaming zeitgeist. AAA&#8217;s adopting &#8216;Early Access&#8217; doesn&#8217;t materially change things for the worse, and in fact, there is an argument to be made that says such a move would further legitimise &#8216;Early Access&#8217; and broaden the range of people willing to try it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>What even is an &#8216;Indie&#8217; anyway?</strong><br />The term covers a vast spectrum, from the solo dev mortgaging their house we mentioned, to &#8216;indie elites&#8217; like Supergiant, Team Cherry, or Larian, pulling in millions with sizable teams. Depending on how you define it, even CD Projekt Red might qualify as indie, given they self-publish.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-8-64743"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-shouldve-launched-in-early-access/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-64743" title="Albeit with an employee count in the 4-digit range."><sup>8</sup></a></span> The gulf between struggling solos and elite indies is at least as significant as the gap between elite indies and AAA, which makes drawing the exclusion line at AAA feel arbitrary.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-47980" height="264" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20221221014306_1-940x264.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide:</em></strong> Yep, you guessed it.

Although this thing has been in the works so long, it certainly has been placed &#8212; for the purposes of retaining sanity &#8212; in my mind into the category of &#8216;never going to turn up in my natural lifespan&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do think a shadow drop at the end of this is not out of the question, but at minimum, I expect we&#8217;ll come away with a release date to go alongside the additional gameplay teaser.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lords of the Fallen II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve only somewhat recently started playing Lords of the Fallen (2023) after their 2.0 update, when they added in co-op by way of a free &#8216;Friends Pass&#8217;, which is a neat addition I always love to see for any game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re not done with it yet, hard to say if we even will (my co-op partner is not much of a Souls-like afficiando), but the experience while not a top-notch-shining-example of the genre was good enough that I&#8217;m holding some interest in seeing where they go next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Europa Universalis V</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not given the Europa Universalis series anywhere near as much time as Crusader Kings, and in fact &#8212; EUIV is the only one I&#8217;ve touched at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is just something about the more personal relationships and stories of CK that pulls it ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so &#8212; colour me interested. Getting in at the ground floor on a Paradox game is generally a good idea if you want to have any hope of learning the game in question without reliance on extensive &#8216;let&#8217;s play&#8217; styled tutorial videos. xD</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Silent Hill <em>f</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230; <em>think</em>&#8230; I&#8217;m interested? I&#8217;ve actually never played a silent hill game before. The concept has always interested me (insofar as I understand it, at least) &#8212; just never made the jump to actually doing anything about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I watched the movie though, if that counts? xD</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, similar to EUV above &#8212; I&#8217;ll await reviews and see how it lands before deciding, but will keep it on my radar in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enshrouded &#8212; Wake of the Water Update</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick search tells me that the only prior mention of Enshrouded on Time to Loot was the <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-january-2024/">January 2024 Journal</a>. Said mention? Just a sole entry logging ~5 hours of play time, and that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll say now what I didn&#8217;t say then: I <em>loved</em> almost everything about my time with Enshrouded, even at that early point (which must&#8217;ve basically been at release).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was just one disappointing factor for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In multiplayer, the quest state is (was? I should look into this) determined by the world state. And not just for things where maybe it makes sense (e.g., rescuing an NPC) but for <em>everything</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you, as I do, prefer to have independent bases *in addition* to the more communal setup&#8211; so far as the quests are concerned anyway, too bad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is absolutely a nitpick, and even if that is unchanged, the look of this update, let alone whatever may have come up to this point, might be the point at which I let it go and jump back in regardless. It looks <em>great</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resident Evil Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My &#8216;real&#8217; introduction to Resident Evil (*cough* outside of the movies) was with what I believe to be the first of the modern entries &#8212; Resident Evil VII: Biohazard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still need to make my way through the frankly amazing-looking remakes at some point, but they may have to wait a bit longer after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Black Myth: Zhong Kui</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yes</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Myth: Wukong, somewhat amazingly, <em>actually managed to live up to the hype.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhong Kui isn&#8217;t just a DLC as earlier speculation suggested, but rather a full-on sequel. I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb and suggest there probably won&#8217;t be as long of a wait this time around, assuming a lot of technology (and perhaps even asset) re-use from Wukong.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vampire: the Masquerade -Bloodlines 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno about this one anymore. It has been through an incredible amount of development hell and studio handovers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might still come out of the oven OK, but I&#8217;d place the chances of that being <em>very</em> slight. Which is a shame, as this occupied the #1 spot on my Steam wishlist for probably a good few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess I might be listing it here now more out of morbid curiosity than anything else. It&#8217;s coming out October 22, 2025 &#8212; so I guess we&#8217;ll know soon enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step. It takes the grand, operatic elements of Star Wars and grounds them in a reality where power is brutal, where ecological concerns dictate the survival of entire civilizations, and where messiahs are as dangerous as they are revered.</p><p>While Star Wars draws inspiration from many sources, including Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films, and Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey, the imprint of Dune is undeniable. Lucas mixed multiple influences to craft his space opera, resulting in a faster-paced, action-driven narrative compared to Dune’s more introspective and politically complex storytelling.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened.

Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened. That bizarre, campy mess deserves to be locked in a vault and yeeted into a black hole. A clone-Ripley with alien DNA? A Xenomorph with puppy dog eyes? No thanks. Some things are best left unacknowledged.</i>).&nbsp;</p><p>And then, decades later, Ridley Scott returned. He promised to answer those burning questions we’d had since Alien.

Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment.

For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city. Here’s how to create a well-rounded cultural hub:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Add the ceramic workshop to a district close to residential zones, maximizing its impact on citizen satisfaction.</li><li>Balance satisfaction areas carefully: Focus on health and creativity early on to keep citizens productive and happy.</li><li>Use decorative statues within districts. Strategically placed statues improve attraction and encourage population growth.</li><li>Expand the radius of cultural buildings. When feasible, prioritize cultural buildings that have a broader impact radius to maximize their effectiveness.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">5. Developing Infrastructure: Production and Trade Routes</h2><p>Setting up trade routes is essential for generating income and balancing resources as your city expands. In the playthrough, the author wisely establishes trade routes to sell excess stone and sand for gold, which funds additional buildings and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>\' trade and production systems:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure to unlock and build both the Horreum, a large storehouse, as well as the Macellum, a large market which will open up Trade Routes. Without these two buildings trade will not be possible.</li><li>Identify surplus resources. Selling excess materials like stone and sand brings in steady gold income, which can be used to fund essential upgrades.</li><li>Upgrade production buildings. Increasing output from woodcutting camps and quarries helps meet the growing demand for building materials.</li><li>Create a balanced workforce. Avoid overspecializing in one resource, which could create shortages elsewhere in your economy.</li><li>Invest in a larger marketplace. Upgrading the marketplace opens up more trade routes, offering new opportunities to exchange goods and expand your economy.</li><li>Manage trade efficiently. Check each route’s profitability and ensure you’re getting maximum value from each transaction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">6. Advanced Growth: Reaching the Tier 2 City</h2><p>As your city grows, upgrading to a Tier 2 city brings new buildings and capabilities, allowing for even greater development. However, this stage also introduces new challenges, such as managing faction tensions. Here are a few ways to make the transition smoothly:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Construct safety-focused buildings. Building structures like arenas can help reduce incidents, which become more likely as factions develop tensions.</li><li>Invest in cultural influence points. Advancing through the ages improves your city’s reputation and allows for higher-level upgrades.</li><li>Manage faction relations. Keep an eye on faction satisfaction levels and address issues before they escalate into conflicts. Certain factions may have different needs or preferences.</li><li>Create additional districts. As new buildings become available, expand your residential and industrial districts to accommodate a growing population.</li><li>Save resources for key upgrades. Some Tier 2 buildings are expensive, so stockpile resources like wood, stone, and gold to avoid delays in construction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">7. Unlocking Wonders and Advanced Cultural Buildings</h2><p>Once you’ve secured your city’s basics, investing in wonders and advanced cultural buildings provides significant boosts. In the video, the author demonstrates how to build high-value structures like the arena and the Agoge Center to enhance influence. Here’s a guide to prioritize wonders effectively:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Focus on the Agoge Center&nbsp;or library to boost cultural influence. These buildings improve city-wide satisfaction and increase your cultural reach.</li><li>Place wonders in high-traffic areas to maximize their impact. Wonders near residential zones offer bonuses to more citizens.</li><li>Consider safety upgrades for wonder districts. Building defensive structures near wonders ensures they’re protected from incidents.</li><li>Save resources for construction. Wonders often require substantial materials, so plan to accumulate what you need before starting.</li><li>Regularly expand surveyor cabins. This allows you to build wonders farther out from the core, increasing your city’s total area.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8. Optimizing Faction Management and Decrees</h2><p>At this stage, you’ll encounter factions with unique demands. Managing these factions carefully, especially if they develop tensions, will become an important of your city management. Use decrees and policies to mitigate conflicts and enhance your city’s stability.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Issue decrees strategically. Certain decrees, such as increased food production, improve citizen satisfaction or reduce faction tensions.</li><li>Manage faction trust levels. High trust prevents conflicts, while low trust increases the likelihood of incidents and disputes.</li><li>Consider faction removal if tensions rise too high. Sometimes, expelling a problematic faction is more beneficial than dealing with constant conflicts.</li><li>Create buffers between rival factions. Placing neutral buildings or parks between contentious factions can reduce interactions and potential conflicts.</li><li>Balance decrees for all factions. Ensure that no single faction feels neglected, as this can quickly lead to dissatisfaction.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2><p>Building a successful city in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;requires a careful blend of resource management, cultural development, and strategic planning.

Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment.

Between work (or trying to find my next role), family, and the general madness of daily life (soccer practices and games, lifts to here and there, the dog, etc.), finding the time to sit down and really immerse yourself in a game can feel like a luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s where city-building games come in, and let me tell you, they\'ve been a game-changer (pun totally intended).</p><span></span><h3 style="text-align: left;">The Magic of the Pause Button</h3><p>First off, let’s talk about one of the biggest perks of city-building games: the ability to pause or stop the game whenever you need to. Whether you\'re deep into a session of Cities: Skylines meticulously planning the perfect road network or trying to ensure your colonists survive another day in Surviving Mars, you can hit pause and step away without missing a beat. No need to worry about respawning in an FPS firefight or letting your team down in the middle of a MOBA match (I could write a whole posts on all the insults I\'ve taken from World of Tanks players).&nbsp;</p><p>These game wait for you, not the other way around.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Meditative Moments in Gaming</h3><p>Additionally, city-building games offer something incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world: a sense of peace and mindfulness. There’s a certain meditative quality to watching your city grow, whether it\'s a bustling metropolis in Cities: Skylines or a fragile colony on the brink of collapse in Frostpunk. You’re not just reacting to what’s happening on screen; you’re crafting something from the ground up, watching your creation evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s like a digital Zen garden, where each decision is a small stone you’re placing just so, bringing order to the chaos. Oh the hundreds of hours I\'ve spent in my Cities Skylines cities, beautifying them with parks, trees and endless landscaping.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Building Something That Lasts (well, sorta)</h3><p>Speaking of crafting, there’s something deeply satisfying about the “building something” aspect of these games. Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge.

Someone with extensive experience piloting TDs would likely tell you that the following are the best setups, crew skills, and playstyle strategies to help your team secure victory.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Vehicle Setup in Detail</h3><h4 style="text-align: left;">Equipment Choices</h4><p>For both the Hellcat and Super Hellcat, the goal is to maximize their strengths: mobility, concealment, and firepower.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Optics (Binocular Telescope or Coated Optics)</b>: Increasing your view range is critical. Spotting enemies before they spot you allows you to make informed decisions on when to shoot and when to relocate. The choice between Binocular Telescope and Coated Optics depends on your playstyle; Binoculars for more stationary play and Coated Optics for more active scouting and repositioning.</li><li><b>Gun Rammer</b>: Reducing your reload time significantly increases your Damage Per Minute (DPM), making you a bigger threat on the battlefield. Being able to shoot more frequently means you can exploit enemy tanks\' vulnerabilities more often.</li><li><b>Camo Net / Turbocharger</b>: The choice here is between enhancing your stealth with a Camo Net or boosting your mobility with a Turbocharger. The Hellcat, being slightly more geared towards ambush tactics, benefits greatly from a Camo Net. The Super Hellcat, with its enhanced mobility, can further capitalize on this with a Turbocharger, allowing for rapid repositioning and flanking maneuvers.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;">Crew Skills in Detail</h3><p>Developing your crew skills is crucial for maximizing the potential of your TDs.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Commander</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Sixth Sense</b> is non-negotiable for TDs. Knowing when you\'ve been spotted can save you from being quickly eliminated.</li><li><b>Recon</b> further boosts your view range, complementing your equipment choices.</li></ul><li><b>Gunner</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> makes you harder to detect, a key survival trait for a TD.</li><li><b>Snap Shot</b> improves your gun\'s accuracy during turret movements, allowing for more reliable shots after repositioning.</li></ul><li><b>Driver</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Smooth Ride</b> reduces the accuracy penalty when firing on the move, which can be beneficial in hit-and-run tactics.</li><li><b>Off-Road Driving</b> improves your mobility on various terrains, enhancing your ability to quickly get into position or escape danger.</li></ul><li><b>Loader</b>: If your TD has a dedicated loader,</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> further enhances your stealth.</li><li><b>Safe Stowage</b> increases the durability of your ammo rack, reducing the chance of being taken out by a single hit.</li></ul></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Super Hellcat | World of Tanks Best Replays</h2><div style="text-align: center;"></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Gameplay Tactics in Detail</h2><h4 style="text-align: left;">Early Game</h4><p>The initial phase of the match is about gathering intelligence and taking key positions without being overly aggressive.</p><p><b>Scout and Reposition</b>: Use your mobility to reach forward positions quickly. Your goal is to gather as much information as possible on enemy movements for your team. After spotting, fall back to a safe distance before engaging.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Mid to Late Game</h4><p>As the match progresses, your role shifts towards exploiting enemy weaknesses and supporting your team from the second line.</p><p><b>Hit and Run</b>: Identify isolated targets or support teammates by targeting enemies focused on your allies. After firing, immediately relocate to avoid counter-fire, especially from enemy artillery or hidden TDs.</p><p><b>Supporting Heavies</b>: Position yourself behind or beside your team’s heavy tanks. From here, you can safely engage enemies that are distracted by your frontline, using your superior DPM to whittle them down.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Map Movement and Positioning</h3><p>Understanding each map\'s key features and sight lines is crucial. Use terrain to your advantage, keeping in mind that your primary goal is to support your team by dealing damage from concealed positions or by exploiting enemy flanks.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Use Terrain: Always be mindful of hills, ridges, and other terrain features that can provide cover or concealment. Being able to shoot without exposing your tank is a key skill for TD players.</li><li>Avoid Open Fields: Open areas are death zones for lightly armored vehicles like the Hellcat and Super Hellcat. Move from cover to cover and stay aware of potential threats like enemy TDs and artillery.</li><li>High Ground Advantage: High ground not only provides a better view of the battlefield but also makes it harder for enemies to hit your tank. Use elevation to your advantage whenever possible.</li></ul><p></p><p>By focusing on these strategies and continuously practicing and refining your skills, you\'ll greatly contribute to your team\'s efforts and enjoy success in your Hellcat and Super Hellcat in World of Tanks.</p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How a Super Hellcat should tag along with...</h2><div><span><div>The Hellcat, with its blend of mobility, firepower, and limited armor, can significantly benefit from coordinating with certain types of vehicles on the battlefield. Here’s a breakdown of which vehicles a Hellcat should consider partnering with and why:</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Medium Tanks</h3><div>Medium tanks are versatile and can perform a wide range of roles, making them excellent partners for the Hellcat. Their balance of speed, armor, and firepower allows them to effectively scout, flank, and engage enemies at various ranges. A Hellcat can support medium tanks by providing additional firepower from a second line or by exploiting openings created by the mediums’ aggressive maneuvers. This pairing can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions, moving to support weakened flanks or to capitalize on enemy vulnerabilities.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heavy Tanks</h3><div>While heavy tanks lack the Hellcat’s mobility, they make up for it with superior armor and firepower. Teaming up with heavy tanks allows the Hellcat to operate from behind the frontline, using the heavies as a shield while it delivers precise shots. This partnership is especially effective in areas with good cover and long sightlines, where the Hellcat can use its excellent gun to support the heavy tanks without exposing itself to enemy fire. The Hellcat should avoid blocking the retreat paths of allied heavy tanks and remain ready to reposition if the enemy breaks through the frontline.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Other TDs</h3><div>Pairing with other TDs, especially those with strong frontal armor, can create a formidable defensive line that can deter enemy advances. The Hellcat, with its good mobility, can act as a scout or flanker for this group, identifying targets for the more heavily armored TDs to engage. However, this requires good communication and coordination to ensure that the Hellcat does not become isolated or targeted by enemy artillery.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Artillery</h3><div>While not directly tagging along with artillery, a Hellcat can play a crucial role in protecting these valuable assets from enemy scouts and light tanks. By staying relatively close to friendly artillery, the Hellcat can use its mobility and firepower to intercept and eliminate threats to the team’s artillery pieces, ensuring they can continue to support the team effectively.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Light Tanks</h3><div>A somewhat less common but potentially effective partnership can be formed with light tanks. Light tanks excel in scouting and can quickly identify key enemy positions. A Hellcat following a light tank at a safe distance can capitalize on the scouting information, using its accurate gun to take out spotted enemies before they can react. However, this requires the Hellcat to stay alert and ready to move, as the light tank’s fast-paced scouting can lead them into rapidly changing situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>When pairing with any vehicle, the key for the Hellcat driver is to maintain situational awareness and adapt to the battle’s flow. The Hellcat\'s strength lies in its ability to deliver impactful damage from positions where it is not easily targeted. Effective communication with teammates and choosing the right moments to strike or relocate are crucial for leveraging the Hellcat’s capabilities to their fullest.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">How NOT to play the Super Hellcat!</h2></span></div><p style="text-align: left;">One of the worst ways to play the Hellcat in World of Tanks is to treat it like a frontline brawler or a heavy tank. The Hellcat is equipped with a powerful gun and excellent mobility but suffers from very thin armor and a relatively open turret design, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fire from almost all types of weapons it encounters on the battlefield.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Mistakes in Playing the Hellcat as a Frontline Tank:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Engaging in Direct Firefights: Attempting to trade shots with enemy tanks, especially heavies or well-armored mediums and TDs, is a quick way to get destroyed. The Hellcat\'s armor is insufficient to absorb hits, and its relatively large profile for a TD makes it an easy target when exposed.</li><li>Ignoring Cover and Concealment: Failing to use the terrain, bushes, and other forms of cover to hide your tank and mask your movements negates one of the Hellcat\'s main strengths – its ability to strike unseen. Being visible on the front lines means you\'ll likely be one of the first targets to be fired upon.</li><li>Static Gameplay: Staying in one position for too long, especially on the front lines, can make you an easy target for enemy artillery and tanks. The Hellcat thrives on its ability to relocate quickly, providing support where it\'s needed and avoiding return fire.</li><li>Not Using its Mobility: The Hellcat\'s speed is a key feature that allows it to flex across the map, responding to threats, reinforcing failing flanks, or exploiting gaps in the enemy lines. Playing it in a stationary, frontline role wastes this potential, making the tank much less effective than it could be.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Avoid These Mistakes:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Play to Your Strengths: Use the Hellcat\'s mobility and excellent gun handling to engage enemies from unexpected angles, relocate frequently to avoid being targeted, and always look for opportunities to support your team from a distance or the second line.</li><li>Stay Aware: Keep an eye on the mini-map and be ready to move if you\'re in danger of being flanked, or if there\'s a more advantageous position you can take to support your team.</li><li>Engage Wisely: Choose your battles carefully. Look for targets that are engaged with your teammates, isolated, or presenting their weaker armor to you. Avoid head-on engagements with tanks that can easily outgun or outarmor you.</li></ul><p></p><p>By avoiding the frontline brawler playstyle and focusing on mobility, stealth, and strategic engagement, you\'ll greatly increase your effectiveness and survivability in the Hellcat, turning it into a formidable asset for your team.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final thoughts...</h2><p>Mastering the Hellcat and Super Hellcat requires patience, good positioning, and an understanding of when to engage or retreat. Remember, your primary role is to support your team by providing accurate and timely damage from a distance or flanking. Avoid direct confrontations with heavier tanks unless you have a clear advantage or support. By following these strategies and adjusting your playstyle based on the battle\'s flow, you\'ll become a valuable asset to your team and help secure victory on the battlefield.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p>Jumping back into World of Tanks after long hiatus, and a big update felt a bit like a cold splash of water yesterday - especially when I dove straight into battle with my Super Hellcat and ended up more like a skittish kitten hiding in the bushes (literally) than the fierce TD I should\'ve been.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, my gameplay was rusty, and the match didn’t go well at all.

Because while higher level items do tend to drop better materials, it\'s the difference between your stat and the enemy/node\'s stat that seems to influence drop rates a lot more. If I\'m level 70 and do a level 30 ore I get way more drops than if I\'m level 70 and do the exact same ore at level 70.</p>\n<p>Its the same for Ginormosia. You need to hit Rank 5 for certain enemies to start spawning, but it seems like after that nothing new appears. Maybe that will change with the upcoming DLC. But it means that keeping the areas at rank 5 or 6 is optimal if what you want is to actually farm drops. If you want more EXP maybe higher level enemies are better for that, but honestly my levelling only started slowing down at 70, the EXP curve seems to steepen after that. But if you\'re careful and well equipped you can still beat enemies that are at 80 as a level 60-70. You burn through a lot of healing items and food and need to be careful about SP consumption, but it\'s very doable. The real problem is not getting drops from those high level enemies because my level is similar or lower.</p>\n<p>For the record, my best combat team is usually me as Magician doing offense, Sloane doing heals, Glenn who has a buff against crown enemies, and either Odin, who has high aggro and defence, or Laura if the enemy is Dark element because her Light move does big numbers.</p>\n<p>Going back to the treasure grove, I\'ve figured out the strategy a bit better. It\'s a lot kinder than most randomized dungeons in games I\'ve played. You can swap team at each floor, you can move through floors you\'ve already cleared automatically, and you can leave whenever you want with no penalty. And the dungeon layout stays the same so you don\'t even have to start again at the beginning. Honestly it\'s even easier than the actual dungeons in this game because you can just open the menu and leave whenever instead of having to run all the way out.</p>\n<p>The only disadvantage is if you find a good room you can\'t just farm it – but the internet says that if you don\'t actually complete the mission for the floor and quit the dungeon it doesn\'t get greyed out and you can just go back in. I haven\'t tested it yet though and I\'ve already read wrong information about this game online before. Like that dark energy and slates only drop from shadow enemies once you hit floor 500. Nope! I just finished floors 200-300 and got plenty.</p>\n<p>So now that I\'ve finished getting all the Ginormosia areas up to Rank 5 or higher I\'ve just been spending a bit of time there toggling the towers back and forth to see if I can get a legendary to spawn and farming so I can restock the veggie stands and make acorns. Which I can then spend on the ultra-rare materials and recipes from the travelling merchants.</p>\n<p>I am going to continue pushing down into the Treasure Grove until I hit something too difficult to get past, but it is really tempting to just keep replanting at floor 300. I\'m getting great stuff every time I go in there. It\'s a grab bag but it feels like a better use of time than killing 5000 bees and collecting 5000 pine logs that I don\'t need.</p>\n<p>I\'ve also collected enough Slates now to get a ton of new recipes I don\'t have the materials to make and unlocked two of the Dark Magic gates. One just had some chests behind it with one recipe, but the second had a recipe and a Luminous Dark Tree which is very good for materials. Unfortunately only one though, and not close enough to the door to actually be an easy thing to farm. Sigh. Treasure Groves really are the way to go.</p>\n<p>When I was digging around lately I found two good resources via reddit:</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasylife/comments/1l0eyd6/ginormosia_area_rank_map_monsters_resources_16/">A hand-drawn map of Ginormosia with the key Rank 5 Gathering spawns</a> by Skyeacreon (Reddit)</p>\n<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qhzobmkJ9U2wv5iFIl6u6xfgzxBspkUALkxTuclykqk/edit?usp=sharing">A spreadsheet of the monsters in each zone and a checklist for the ones required for rank up</a> by ???

And I came across some upscaled versions of old MacOS wallpapers. And got a bit nostalgic.</p>\n<p>Definitely the last OS update I\'ve ever been genuinely excited for was Mavericks. That introduced native Dark Mode. There were a few helpful features after that, and the change to storage type was probably necessary, but that was really the perfect OS for me. It had everything I needed. I stopped updating my 2015 MacBook Pro at Mavericks because I really wasn\'t confident newer OS versions would be ok on the older hardware. It was already struggling with basic stuff. And I had a lot of software that had stopped supporting OS versions that old, but I didn\'t want to upgrade to newer versions because I would have to start paying a subscription fee instead of the one-time payment I had made however many years before.</p>\n<p>I definitely feel like moving to Windows 11 was a step backwards in a lot of ways. There are a lot of features and programs I just took for granted on MacOS that Windows still doesn\'t have. Even though I have stripped out all of the ad and AI bullshit and telemetry and shit, I do genuinely feel like Win11 is a worse OS than a version of MacOS from 10 years ago. It\'s just actively unpleasant to use.</p>\n<p>But I did spend a huge amount of time perfecting my Mac setup too. I told myself I\'d just have to spend that much time again getting Windows to work the way I want it to. But after a year of using it I still feel like Windows is constantly fighting me.</p>\n<p>The thing is, in my experience since switching off of MacOS and having to switch to mostly FOSS software for financial reasons the experience is still, generally, worse. I don\'t want to hear that I\'m just more familiar with MacOS and that\'s why I like it more. I started out on Win 95 and used Win XP up until university, I taught myself Command Prompt commands to deal with my shit-ass school-mandated Dell laptop and the million ways in which it would break. Then I switched to OSX for undergrad and it did, genuinely Just Work. I customized the hell out of it, but it wasn\'t because the built-in default software didn\'t work or because the settings were ass, it\'s because that\'s just the type of person I am.</p>\n<p>I used OSX/MacOS from 2007 to 2023. My first was a black plastic MacBook that just barely got me through my honours thesis – the hard drive was failing and the OS would get too corrupted and start repeatedly kernel panicking about once a month so I had my school files all backed up online and a full disk image on an external hard drive so whenever it failed I would reboot from the image, reinstall the OS, and then keep chugging away until it failed again. When I got to graduation I convinced my parents to buy me a new MacBook Pro for my masters. That lasted another four years before I bought a 2015 MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>I couldn\'t justify replacing it with another MacBook at the price they\'re at while I\'m unemployed. They\'ve always had a brand tax, but before I felt it was worth it. They had very good quality control and designs and you didn\'t have to compare a million different models at a million different prices. Now, the gap between them and the comparable budget to medium quality laptop is higher and the benefits seem less. MacOS has been iOS-ified and locked down. I learned how to program on MacOS and now they don\'t even want people to be able to install unsigned software.</p>\n<p>So I bought a Windows PC with the full intention of installing Linux. I did a lot of research and I tried dual booting PopOS, got it installed, and then somehow in the process of trying to figure out how to add GNOME extensions (the most unintuitive process I have ever seen) and get Bluetooth to work it crashed and it was unrecoverable even with Rescuezilla. I probably messed something up in my fiddling around with keyboard layouts trying to get it to use the Windows key in the same way Mac keyboards use the ⌘ key. Using CTRL+ as a modifier key is very un-ergonomic with small hands. I have to hold it with my left pinky finger.</p>\n<p>Anyway, had to wipe the whole thing. Didn\'t have the energy or motivation to try again at the time. Reinstalled Win11. I know that it might only take half an hour to an hour to get the actual OS installed, but the process after that of making it actually usable? Will my duplicati file backups even be read okay by a different file system? And then troubleshooting everything that breaks? Spending hours reading <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth_headset">that fucking Arch Linux wiki trying to diagnose what part of the 40000 ways Bluetooth can break</a> just so I can use my headphones?? (No disrespect to the Arch Linux wiki it\'s incredibly detailed.)  Yeah, I\'ll try again when I have the patience.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you hate Windows and you can\'t afford Mac you\'ve only got Linux, right? But the thing is. As I have experienced over the past year of having this laptop and trying to self host things on my NAS. FOSS often feels like a step down. Like, it\'s hard to find a piece of properly maintained open source software that is the same or better than comparative corporate / proprietary options in terms of functionality, reliability, and ease of use. They might be better in terms of security or privacy or ethics, and learning more about how computers actually work may be good for people overall, but you have to show people the real trade-off they\'re making.</p>\n<p>I genuinely think it\'s irresponsible to recommend Linux / de-googling / FOSS to normies as if it\'s going to be a 1-to-1 replacement and then throw up your hands when they complain and say it\'s just open source you can\'t expect too much. If you\'re prepared to actually provide hand-holding one-on-one tech support for someone as you transition them to another OS / software, which they have to use every day and rely on for life-critical things, then I salute you. Godspeed.</p>\n<p>So anyway. <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/default-mac-wallpapers-in-5k/">Here are the MacOS default wallpapers upscaled to high res</a> at 512pixels. I picked MacOS Monterey\'s dark mode for now, but downloaded a few. If I had found this earlier I maybe would have just colour sampled it and use it as my blog theme colours.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 1\xa0day, 19\xa0hours ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-16-fast-beginner-instant-pot-recipes" title="Fast Beginner Instant Pot Recipes">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-17-fantasy-life-i-150-hrs-update" title="Fantasy Life i - 150 hrs update">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Some nostalgia for old MacOS versions triggered by looking at default wallpapers and a short rant about FOSS.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-17-i-miss-osx/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Some nostalgia for old MacOS versions triggered by looking at default wallpapers and a short rant about FOSS.'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'journal', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'tech', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-17T16:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=17, tm_hour=16, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=4, tm_yday=290, tm_isdst=0)}

There are a lot of frozen veg that will cook for about the same amount of time as frozen chicken thighs so you can also just keep that in the freezer. <a href="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/instant-pot-chicken-thighs/">Here\'s the times I use for chicken.</a></p>\n<p>Stewing beef (off-cuts) is also good for the instant pot, but you need to brown it before cooking it to lock in the juices and be sure all the pieces are the same size so they cook evenly. Over-cooked beef really isn\'t great so you have to get the timing right.</p>\n<p>Calrose, arboro or other shortgrain rice can be cooked separately (6 mins high + 10 mins natural release) and put in the fridge and then cook the chicken thighs when you want them to put over top.</p>\n<p>Season before putting things into the pot.</p>\n<p>And my hot tip is you can fry bacon in the bottom of the pot and then take the bacon out. Anything you cook with the leftover bacon fat at the bottom of the pot will be extra tasty.</p>\n<p>My go-to recipes are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-07-15-chicken-rice-soup/">Chicken rice soup with veg</a> - very much dump it all in and go</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.happyfoodstube.com/instant-pot-chicken-risotto/">Chicken mushroom risotto</a> - requires a bit of sauteing to start but super warm and filling. I have bastardized this to remove the mushroom and onion and added in other veg.</li>\n<li>Chicken cacciotore (kind of) - chicken thighs in tomato puree. Generous italian seasoning (basil, oregano, black pepper, thyme, parsley) on the chicken thighs. Tomato puree in the pot with some water, whatever frozen veg you have (I usually do spinach cubes, but other firm veg like carrot or peas are usually also ok), bit of soy sauce and cooking wine, grate or chop some parmasean or grana padano in. Put the chicken thighs in on top, they don\'t need to be covered by the sauce. Same cooking time as linked above. Serve over rice.</li>\n<li><a href="https://funwithoutfodmaps.com/low-fodmap-beef-stew/">Beef stew</a> - great in cold weather but with the price of beef these days I don\'t do it much</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can see you can basically do chicken thighs + some sort of sauce or soup stock + rice + veg in any combination. Softer veg like raw tomatoes might go mushy or wilt but sometimes that\'s fine. All of these take 60 mins or less for me, but probably more like 90 when I was just learning and still modifying the recipe.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 2\xa0days, 5\xa0hours ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-13-fantasy-life-i-140-hrs-update" title="Fantasy Life i - 140 hrs update">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-17-i-miss-osx" title="I Miss OSX">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Some short instant pot tips and a few starter recipes.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-16-fast-beginner-instant-pot-recipes/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Some short instant pot tips and a few starter recipes.'}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'cooking', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'instant pot', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'recipes', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-16T18:50:15.851632+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=16, tm_hour=18, tm_min=50, tm_sec=15, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=289, tm_isdst=0)}

I\'m quite overlevelled of course. The story of the game overall was a bit underwhelming, but I liked the references to the original game and it wasn\'t bad per se. The best parts of the game are taken from the first game in general, but I can\'t deny it has kept my attention for this long.</p>\n<p>I don\'t know if I\'ll bother getting the two combat jobs that I haven\'t levelled at all up to Hero. It means a lot of grinding of mooks. I prefer just playing the jobs I can do on muscle memory. But now I have most of the Ginormosia areas up to rank 5 I have access to a lot more rare enemies and materials without having to go back down into the dungeons, which are so annoying to get in and out of. Today I finally saw a gold crown sheep enemy that drops a type of fleece that I need for my hero crafting.  So I\'m getting there. While I grind I\'m making an effort to get as many comrades up to full hearts as possible, it doesn\'t seem completely impossible.</p>\n<p>Based on what I read about the post-game content I\'m going to need to kill a lot of shadow enemies to get drops from them and there\'s two main ways to do that: the fortress or the treasure groves. The fortress means guaranteed spawns, the treasure grove means getting more other stuff at the same time. I have a necklace with item drop+ on it, but I need to try to make some more other stuff with that skill on it as well to make best use of my time. I might need some more of those remake cube currency things.</p>\n<p>I also know that I need to get the shadow energy balls dropping from shadow enemies to unlock the gates throughout the game. It\'s going to be annoying going back through every dungeon to find them all. I wish this game had a "repel spray" item or the dragon quest mechanic of weak enemies running away from you. Even if you can totally ignore them and they don\'t do any damage hitting you it\'s still annoying.</p>\n<p>I hadn\'t even touched the treasure groves before finishing the story, so I\'ve only made it down to floor 200 now (each floor goes by 10 so it\'s not as much as it sounds). I thought I probably would have to grind all the way down until I got to the level 50 layer to find anything good, but I\'ve already had ultra-rare materials spawn at level 20-30. Maybe it\'s because I\'m already level 70-ish in all my combat/gathering lives? But I\'m very happy to finally see some Magic Ore. I still haven\'t even seen any in Ginormosia.</p>\n<p>It\'s annoying that the Encyclopaedia in-game isn\'t super comprehensive. It mostly only shows you the first place you can find something. It still might be available elsewhere. And all the wikis/walkthroughs these days are bloated and ugly, even with quite strict ad-blocking you have to spend ages to find out one fact. The title of the page will be like "Location of Magic Ore" and then you have to scroll multiple times to find the single line of text that tells you where it is. The rest is just junk. And then you have to check somewhere else to confirm and they disagree. Argh.</p>\n<p>So when I play now my tasks are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy more shadow carrot seeds.</li>\n<li>Plant seeds and water.</li>\n<li>Go to Ginormosia and finish levelling areas to rank 5.</li>\n<li>Check for good legendary spawns and do those.</li>\n<li>Clear the first floor of the fortress for shadow enemies.</li>\n<li>Go back and check on the seeds to water them again.</li>\n<li>Do a treasure grove run.</li>\n<li>Turn in the shadow slate things for recipes.</li>\n<li>Restock veggies at stands and find merchants to spend acorns on rare materials and new recipes.</li>\n<li>Collect Celestia flowers.</li>\n<li>Check on the gallery (because it affects the island rank up).</li>\n<li>See what new things I can craft now that I have a few more new materials – I especially want to get at least one more legendary tool going.</li>\n<li>Talk to the Plundering Jaguar for upgrades to the legendary equipment.</li>\n<li>Craft some more food and potions.</li>\n<li>Harvest vegetables.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I guess I\'ll keep playing as long as I\'ve still got TV to watch while playing it. I\'m sure my brain will just turn off it suddenly at some point, as it does.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 5\xa0days, 6\xa0hours ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-13-bearblog-theme-css-v10" title="Bearblog Theme CSS v10">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-16-fast-beginner-instant-pot-recipes" title="Fast Beginner Instant Pot Recipes">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Beat the game story, still grinding up Ginormosia, killing shadow enemies, and venturing into Treasure Groves.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-13-fantasy-life-i-140-hrs-update/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Beat the game story, still grinding up Ginormosia, killing shadow enemies, and venturing into Treasure Groves.'}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'fantasy life i', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'video games', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-13T20:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=13, tm_hour=20, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=286, tm_isdst=0)}

I didn\'t 100% adhere to it, but it was good for having a guide so I didn\'t spend all day trying every possible combination. So for e.g. violet-1 and 2 are for backgrounds and violet 11 and 12 are for text.</p>\n<p>I also didn\'t actually use the scale itself in the css, I copied and pasted the values into my own naming scheme, which I may end up regretting.

I\'m just going to leave them as is for now.</p>\n<p>I\'m not entirely satisfied with how it turned out, it\'s a bit <em>too</em> monochrome now, but I feel better having a solid base to work off of. It would be nice to have multiple "button" colours depending on the actual button\'s purpose and I\'m not entirely happy with the link styling either. But we\'ll see.</p>\n<h2 id="font-sizes">Font Sizes</h2><p>I\'ve been using clamp-based responsive font sizes <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-08-25-bearblog-theme-css-update/#font-sizes">for a while</a>, but the smaller font sizes are a bit too small on mobile. So I adjusted those. They\'re still pretty close to what they were nobody will probably notice the difference much. Just me, the person who spends the most time staring at the site.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">\t</span><span class="nt">--size-xsmall</span><span

id="mark-and-code">Mark and Code</h2><p>Added styling for <code>mark</code> and <code>code</code> html elements. I haven\'t actually used mark to highlight anything yet but I might want to? And code is for small bits of code in-line with text of course.</p>\n<h2 id="suffering-with-accordions">Suffering With Accordions</h2><p>I\'ve tried out the <code>details</code> tag and it seems good for truncating long text in the middle or end of a post. Most of the other css-only code snippets I found for the purposes of collapsing long text were more focused on full-on accordion menus or truncating long text into a modal window type thing. I don\'t want to have to make a whole elaborate thing that I\'ll have to copy and paste into a post every time I want to use it. So I thought for the purposes of posts like this where I\'m going to include a long block of text I\'m going to stick with <code>details</code> until it becomes a problem.</p>\n<p>The HTML looks like:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">details</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">summary</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Text that goes on the button<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">summary</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\nThe text you want to hide<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">details</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n<p>You can style it differently depending on if its open or closed and you can change the little arrow marker like it was a list marker.</p>\n<p>But then of course when I actually tried it to collapse a long piece of code the Markdown fenced code block doesn\'t render. So I tried to make the same kind of code block that markdown renders by hand in just html and now I don\'t have syntax highlighting any more. Because there aren\'t the bazillion little <code>span</code>s to target. 😩 So yeah I guess it\'s one or the other unless I figure out something else.</p>\n<h2 id="full-theme-code">Full Theme

I\'m not doing anything special for it, other than watch the Blue Jays. Canadian Thanksgiving doesn\'t have quite the same colonialist trappings as the US version, even when I was a kid it was just a harvest festival that had nothing to do with the subjugation of indigenous people. I don\'t know if they teach more indigeneity around the holiday in schools now. It was my favourite holiday as a teenager because unlike all the other official school holidays or my birthday it didn\'t have any negative memories associated with it and I got to eat good food made by my relatives. The fact that my parents can\'t cook beyond boiling things or heating things up in the microwave is well known in my extended family. Just being able to have homemade food, including apple pie for dessert, made the forced socializing worthwhile. Unfortunately I cannot see the point of cooking for one and apples now extremely reliably give me IBS cramps. 😭</p>\n<div class="toc">\n<h2 class="toc-head">Contents:</h2>\n<ol class="toc-list"><li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#reading">Reading</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#watching">Watching</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#listening">Listening</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#playing">Playing</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#living">Living</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#bookmarking">Bookmarking</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><h3 id="emmurder-at-the-black-cat-cafeem-by-seishi-yokomizo"><em>Murder at the Black Cat Café</em> by Seishi Yokomizo</h3><p>I did finally read it the night before it was due back at the library. 😅 It was disappointingly short because even though it is a slim book to begin with it\'s actually two totally separate novellas rather than one, and the second one isn\'t listed anywhere on the front or back cover. It\'s a nice cover design, but confusing choice by the publisher. The second story is "Why the Well Wheel Creaked" and actually is much more emotionally moving and scary than the main one. But they both hinge on the mystery trope of a dual identity.</p>\n<p>There is something calming or satisfying about Yokomizo\'s stories, they\'re always perfectly complete puzzles. There might be lots of red herrings, false alibis, and multiple suspects, but at the end when you find out the solution from Kindaichi you don\'t feel tricked but rather that it was perfectly put together. The first story feels like it could have been drawn out to at least small novel length; if you read it right through as I did you won\'t have time to really try to come up with a solution by yourself unless you\'re very disciplined and stop midway on purpose. Unfortunately, one black cat does die. :(</p>\n<p>The second story is on a theme that Yokomizo has touched on before with Gokumon Island: soldiers returning changed from the war. The history of a rural noble family is told and their conflicts with other local families and you can see with the set-up what is probably going to happen, but the way the story unravels in epistolic form with a signature Yokomizo twist is still tragic and horrifying. No Kindaichi in this one either.</p>\n<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><h3 id="the-celebrity-traitors">The Celebrity Traitors</h3><p>As mentioned last week, <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-11-the-traitors-death-game-manga/">I did end up making a rec list of death game manga</a> that have a somewhat similar set-up to The Traitors or are focused on trust/lying and psychological manipulation.</p>\n<p>The first episode of Celeb Traitors was incredibly enjoyable and a fun variation on the original. It wouldn\'t replace the original because part of the appeal of the original is that it\'s just normal everyday people participating and these are all people who have public personas and know how to act for a camera. But Alan Carr turning into a puddle of anxiety is very, very funny to watch.</p>\n<p>Deeply irritated to find out that you can\'t access the tie-in podcast outside a UK IP address. let-me-in dot gif. It\'s hosted by Ed Gamble, of course, because I\'m only already listening to two other podcasts by him.</p>\n<h3 id="sportsball">Sportsball</h3><p>Blue Jays vs Mariners is a 7 game series which feels like it\'s going to take forever, even if they only take breaks during travel days. Baseball games are <em>so long</em>. The first game starts Sunday at 8pm. I always start watching a half hour or hour late so I can use the catch-up feature to skip the ads and boring bits, but I still haven\'t quite learned what parts of the game are safe to skip.</p>\n<p>Hackey has started. The Leafs will be playing the same afternoon as the Jays game at the ACC, so that area of the waterfront is going to be an absolute nightmare of people tomorrow. Not that I was planning on going down there. Raptors basketball doesn\'t start until the 22nd, I\'ll have to find a google calendar of their schedule to plug into mine.</p>\n<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2><p><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-04-oct-week-1-digest/#listening">Same as last week.</a></p>\n<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2><h3 id="jigsaw-puzzle">Jigsaw Puzzle</h3><p>I\'ve been working steadily at it and it\'s almost halfway done now, but I\'m slowing down again as I hit a vague white/beige/yellow/pink area in the middle. I might start working from the top down now, the areas with more saturated colours are easier to find the pieces for. Running out of room on the board to actually put the loose pieces.</p>\n<p>I haven\'t seen any new puzzles at the charity shop, alas. I might have to try the nearest Value Village, but they\'ll definitely be more expensive.</p>\n<h3 id="fantasy-life-i">Fantasy Life i</h3><p>Ran credits on Fri night after beating the final bosses handily.  I\'m quite over-levelled. Didn\'t cry, surprisingly, but it was a nice ending. I also did my first Treasure Grove to get a feel for it. I\'ve done some reading and it seems I will have to do some serious grinding if I want to get access to the recipes and materials needed to rank my crafters up to Hero. But what else am I going to do during these 4 hour long baseball games??</p>\n<h2 id="living">Living</h2><p>Despite feeling somewhat better mood-wise after last week, I\'m still having an absolutely awful time trying to sleep. I don\'t know if it\'s residual background stress or what. As a result I\'m also finding it hard to motivate myself to get things off the to do list because I\'m just tired and headachey all day. I haven\'t even really been working on CSS, although I still have a few things on my list to fix/change. I need to get back to cleaning and working on job applications.</p>\n<h2 id="bookmarking">Bookmarking</h2><p><a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/guide">Defetive by Design\'s Guide to DRM-Free Living</a></p>\n<p>This is an old link, DBD has been around for a long time, but I saw a mastodon post about someone asking where to find DRM-free ebooks and this list came to mind.</p>\n<p><a href="https://robertbirming.com/bear-blog-plugins/">Bear Blog Plugins</a> by Robert Birming</p>\n<p>A javascript pagination plug-in and a link to a github repository with a few other plug-ins.</p>\n<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2019/12/why-details-is-not-an-accordion/">Why </details> is Not an Accordion</a> by Dave Rupert</p>\n<p>When I was looking up methods of making an accordion with just html/css I ran across this blog post that summarizes some social media discussion/warring blog posts about using the html details tag to make accordions. There are a lot of functional and accessibility issues with trying to do that, as it turns out.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/scales">Radix Colors - Scales</a></p>\n<p>I already included this in my <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-07-bearblog-custom-colours/">colours link blog post</a>, but I think it\'s what I\'m going to use for the blog once I get around to inputting all the hex codes and then find and replacing a bunch of stuff. Specifically the Mauve-Grey and Violet swatches. I really appreciate all the information in this guide on how to use the colour swatches as well, it makes things quite straight forward and eliminates the need to do contrast checking and tweaking by myself.</p>\n<p><a href="https://discourse.32bit.cafe/t/resources-list-for-the-personal-web/49">32 Bit Cafe Resources List</a></p>\n<p>Has a nice long list of links for everything from accessibility to webrings.</p>\n<p><a href="https://blog.avas.space/influencers/">a frank piece about influencers</a> by ava</p>\n<p>I don\'t spend enough time in the spaces that influencers occupy to know any of them, but that is intentional. The whole thing feels quite skeevy and I hate having other people\'s perfect clean homes and perfect faces and immaculately decorated desks constantly shoved in my face. I had always assumed most of them were lying/faking their prosperity, but Ava goes into some of the specific tricks influencers use to make themselves look good in a way that is functionally impossible to replicate.</p>\n<p>I know people talk about the decline of literacy in the American (and Canadian) youth all the time, I don\'t really buy into it, but I especially think that they are probably much more video literate and savvy about this stuff than people like me. People have always lied on the internet, but people my age and older have also always been trained to see photo/video as the truest "proof" of authenticity there is.

However, some manga are entirely focused on the game, whereas in others the game is simply a single story arc or secondary to other genres. It could be defined as situations where a group of people are isolated and forced to play games with deadly consequences. Sometimes the consequences are financial, but usually with the implication that this person is going to be so financially ruined by losing that they might as well be dead.</p>\n<p>Most people know of it from Hunger Games, Squid Games, Danganronpa, or maybe the OG classic that popularized the style: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_%28novel%29">Battle Royale</a>. Japanese media didn\'t invent the "trap a bunch of people and make them play games to survive" idea, but in the 00s and 10s it seems to have captured the feeling of the time and they sure ran with it. It has since been superseded in popularity with edgy teens by isekai.</p>\n<p>These manga tend to be shelved as shounen (teen boys) or seinen (adult men) in the "Survival" category as well as "Psychological Horror" or "Thriller", but they vary in tone.</p>\n<h3 id="meta-analysis">Meta Analysis</h3><p>The trope is, in my opinion, mostly a representation of both the anxieties of teens, for whom every school day can feel like a life or death struggle, and the financial anxieties of adults in a punishing capitalist system with a firm social hierarchy. It particularly legitimizes the feelings of teenagers, who are experiencing the hightened emotions of puberty combined with being forced to attend school and obey adults even when they are being cruel or irrational. Navigating the social nuances of high school may not <em>literally</em> be life or death, but it sure feels like it. It provides a fantasy of being the one person capable of breaking the oppressive system, the person who is different from all the others, while also justifying violence as a necessary evil to survive the game. It\'s finally fine to kill that annoying co-worker and rebel against your boss and you will be hailed as a hero for doing it!</p>\n<p>It usually investigates themes of despair and hope, trust and friendship, meritocracy vs kleptocracy, survival of the fittest vs supporting the weak, and harsh truths vs the masks we wear every day. Most authors tend towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellum_omnium_contra_omnes">a Hobbsian view</a> where at the end of the day people will do anything to survive and the base nature of humanity is selfishness and competition. However there is often a "if we try really hard to trust each other we can overcome our base instincts and succeed" message i.e. build "civilization" as a bulwark against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature?useskin=vector#Thomas_Hobbes">"state of nature"</a> being forced on the players by the game. In many of the longer stories, the "players" uprising in revolution against the "game masters" is a key story arc, however it is usually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary">reactionary</a> revolution, attempting to return to an idealized prior existence.</p>\n<p>It is narratively a really convenient way to put a bunch of people who wouldn\'t normally interact into highly emotional over the top situations. Much like the traditional Agatha Christie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_circle_of_suspects">closed circle murder mystery</a>. It also allows the author to explore ideas of "human nature" while excusing quite a lot of extreme behaviour that would be outside the norm, both in terms of violence and sex. The structure of having games with rules and phases of play also provides a ready-made narrative structure and provides predictable story beats.</p>\n<h3 id="the-stereotypical-death-game">The Stereotypical Death Game</h3><p>Sometimes the games are gambling-related, sometimes they\'re logic puzzles, sometimes they\'re a forced dilemma, sometimes they are innocuous children\'s games – that was actually a super over-done trope well before Squid Games got there, which is why I was kind of baffled by it being heralded as innovative and genius by Western media reviewers. Death games can be more cerebral, and focused on logical thinking, psychology, deduction, and manipulation or more physical and focused on violence, combat, or survival in a harsh environment, but usually it\'s a mix of both.</p>\n<p>Protagonists are often quiet but smart "unassuming" male high schoolers or young adults, but they are sometimes adults. Female protagonists are pretty rare. There is usually quite a lot of gore and quite a lot of fanservice. Sometimes the protagonist is a Good Guy who wants to Win Through Friendship, but more often he is an anti-hero master manipulator logical thinker who has a heart of gold.</p>\n<p>The shorter manga usually have a smaller set of characters who are forced into playing one game together and thereby revealing lots of things about them and their backstory. The longer ones inevitably end up with many more characters both joining the protagonist\'s team and fighting against them. They also necessarily have many more games, which means they often over-stay their welcome as the author has to beat <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfEscalatingThreat">the Dragon Ball problem</a> of ever-increasing challenges for the protagonist to overcome while also justifying why the protagonist is even there at all. Which is hard when you\'ve already established a standard where losing is death and people desperately want out of the game.</p>\n<h2 id="wtf-is-the-traitors">WTF is The Traitors</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Traitors_%28British_TV_series%29">The Traitors</a> is a reality tv show originating with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Verraders">the Dutch</a>, but after it was franchised to the BBC in the UK hit worldwide popularity. It has finished its third series and has just started a first Celebrity Traitors series which will hopefully be very revealing. The host is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Winkleman">Claudia Winkleman</a> who acts as narrator and shepherds the contestants through their tasks.</p>\n<p>The premise of The Traitors is 22-ish normal people are taken to a castle in the Scottish Highlands. These are notably not influencers, B-list celebs, or reality tv regulars. Some of them will be secretly selected to be Traitors who can than "murder" other members. The non-traitors are called Faithful and they must choose to banish someone every day in the hopes of banishing a traitor and saving themselves. At the end of the game if one or more traitors are included in the final group of winners they will take the whole prize pot and the faithful get nothing. To add to the stress during the day the group go on "missions" that are usually elaborate team bonding exercises and they must work as a group regardless of suspicions in order to increase the prize pot.</p>\n<p>So it\'s basically a variation on mafia, wink murder, or werewolf game. You have to decide who you trust and then coordinate on who you will remove from the game without becoming suspected or targeted yourself.</p>\n<p>One of my first criticisms of the show when I started watching with Series 3 is that the missions were kids summer camp level difficulty. There was zero intellectual challenge and while there were more physically intensive missions there was never any risk of losing all the money or anyone being knocked out of the game. I thought they were basically impossible to fail – and then I watched series 2 where some of the missions were a bit more complicated and the teams very nearly failed almost all of them. (And I suspect in some cases the producers gave them a pass on some cheating or gave them some extra time to ensure they finished.) So I was under-whelmed by the actual level of jeopardy people were in, even if it was entirely fictional.</p>\n<p>This show is an excellent insight into how unrealistic most death game manga are -- it clearly demonstrates that 90% of people involved in a real death game would panic, rely on "gut instinct", and follow the herd. And the remaining 10% who come in familiar with logic puzzles and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame">wargames</a> tend to fail miserably at rallying the group around actual legitimate strategy and get voted out for being too smart and too calm. It\'s honestly an awful format for so many reasons, but certainly entertaining.</p>\n<h2 id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>For the purpose of this list I\'m mostly focused on the manga with a strong trust/lying element rather than the ones that are mostly about combat battle royales or which have a fantasy/sci-fi setting. As someone who has been around the genre for a while I feel these are all obvious and popular recs, so if you have already read all of these, sorry.</p>\n<p>The best death game manga still tend to be kind of… bad. This is popcorn reading. The art tends to be not very exciting and the stories tend to be formulaic. The protagonists even look pretty much interchangeable most of the time. It is extremely difficult to find one with an actually satisfying ending (don\'t even get me started on Gantz) so quitting partway through is valid. These are recommendations of ones that managed to hold my attention for one reason or another.</p>\n<p>There is almost always discussion or depiction of torture, violence, gruesome deaths, gore, animal cruelty, rape, sexual assault used for comedy, child abuse, slavery, suicide, abusive relationships, drug use, alcohol use, gambling, blackmail, participation in cults, etc etc.</p>\n<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2><h3 id="jinrou-game">Jinrou Game / 人狼ゲーム</h3><p>Kawakami Ryou & Koudon (2014, Takeshobo)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A manga cover of a young woman with light brown hair and glasses in a ripped sailor fuku covered in blood with her arms above her head as they transform into a bronze skulls.

Very gory, lots of T&amp;A. But very similar set-up to The Traitors. A bunch of teenagers are kidnapped and trapped together. There are two werewolves (jinrou) and the rest are villagers. The werewolves must kill someone every night, the villagers must vote for someone to be killed every day, and then kill them with their own hands. If they refuse to participate they are killed. Whichever side kills all of the others wins. However these people realize they are all actually connected somehow. And, rare in this space, the ending is pretty good. There are some sequels but I haven\'t read them.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 7/10</p>\n<h3 id="liar-game">Liar Game</h3><p>Kaitani Shinobu (2005, Shueisha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A brightly coloured image with three people layered on top of each other.

The title is written in a rainbow gothic font with the Japanese pronounciation katakana underneath the Roman characters and the number 4.

When the game ends, in 30 days, you will have to return your 100 million. If your opponent steals them, he can keep them as a prize, and you will have a debt of 100 million…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Long, 200 chapters. Unlike a lot of these, there is almost no physical violence. While the participants are manipulated into joining the game, they are also given multiple opportunities to back out. It is fundamentally a story about greed and trust, much like The Traitors. The protagonist is a young naïve woman who gets sucked in to the game by trusting the wrong person. She meets a professional con artist fresh out of jail who agrees to participate with her in exchange for half the winnings. She develops over the course of the manga into a more life-savvy character and he reveals deeper motives than just cash. The characters in this are fun and while the games are often based on logic puzzles they aren\'t just about finding a solution, they\'re usually also about persuading or manipulating the other players. It\'s honestly a good overview of a lot of ways in which people are conned or pressured into making bad decisions in real life. There is even a trans woman character that shows up partway through who, for once, isn\'t a caricature. The first volume is quite a good representation of how the rest goes, but if you think Nao is annoying she gets better I promise. The ending isn\'t great, the plot does peter out somewhat, but the games are well structured and it focuses on real-world psychology rather than going for shock value.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>\n<h3 id="tomodachi-game">Tomodachi Game / トモダチゲーム</h3><p>Yamaguchi Mikoto & Satou Yuki (2014, Kodansha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A young Japanese man wearing a black parka is reaching towards the camera with narrow brown eyes and shaggy black hair.

Suspicion falls on two of Yuichi\'s friends, Sawaragi Shiho and Shibe Makoto.\nSoon afterward, the five of them are kidnapped, and wake up in a strange room with a character from a short-lived anime. Apparently, one of them has entered them into a "friendship game" in order to take care of their massive debt. But who was it, and why did they have such a debt? Could they have stolen the money from class to pay for entry into the game? Katagiri and his best friends will have to succeed in psychological games that will test or destroy their faith in one another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Very Long, 249 chapters. One of the manga that is explicitly about friends betraying each other, with games designed to split people apart. If you like Death Note you\'ll like this, there is a lot of thinking by the genius anti-hero protagonist and then "Nani?!" reveals. If you actually want to try to solve puzzles or mysteries along with the players you probably won\'t enjoy this one as much. The art quality gets better as you go along, but the story gets repetitive and also the female characters\' breasts keep getting mysteriously bigger. There is some violence and involves more outdoors survival phases, but there is less outright shock gore.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 7/10</p>\n<h3 id="as-the-gods-will">As The Gods Will / 神さまの言うとおり</h3><p>Kaneshiro Muneyuki & Fujimura Akeji (2011, Kodansha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A very orange and yellow heavily sylized drawing with a young man reaching towards the camera with one hand and holding two cards in his left.

Yep, it was doing Squid Game 10 years before Squid Game, but with mostly high schoolers. As an interesting twist, the death games are something that is happening out in normal society, where everyone can see it, not in a locked dungeon somewhere. The protagonist is a "normal guy" who rises to the death game occasion, turns out to have a special ability, and builds a team to win. Decent character development. Has a very comedic/absurd style, but isn\'t scared of introducing characters and then immediately killing them off, which I always respect. Lots of girls with big boobs and typical shounen sex comedy. The ending isn\'t actually an ending, there is a direct sequel that leads to the actual conclusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 6/10</p>\n<h3 id="alice-in-borderland">Alice in Borderland / 今際の国のアリス</h3><p>Asou Haro (2010, Shogakugan)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A monochrome magenta stylized image of a naked woman who is seated with long hair covering her body and one eye is white.

Will Chota, Karube, and Ryouhei be able to survive this dangerous new world, and is there a way they can get back to their original lives?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Long, 18 volumes. Perhaps more well known because it was made into a Netflix drama. The protagonist is a typical teen guy, but unlike a lot of the other death game manga contains a lot of adult characters. The mix of ages is more like The Traitors, and the need for teamwork to get through the missions. While there is a fair bit of T&amp;A and some gags I think this is one of the better ones in terms of serious character writing. There are certainly more female characters that aren\'t just sex objects. The games also tend to have more depth and a trick to them. However it definitely went on too long and the ending was just never going to be satisfying.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>\n<h3 id="usogui">Usogui / 嘘喰い</h3><p>Sako Toshio (2006, Shueisha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="The POV is underneath an invisible platform that the character is standing on.

Usogui (The Lie Eater) as he gambles against maniacal opponents at games – such as Escape the Abandoned Building, Old Maid, and Hangman – to ultimately “out-gamble” and control the neutral organization of Kakerou itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saving the best for last. God, I wish it would get licensed and released in deluxe omnibus volumes. This manga is not really much like The Traitors, as most of the games in it are one on one or a small group against another small group, but it is very much about psychological manipulation. Also it is one of my all-time favourites so I have to give it a plug.</p>\n<p>However it is a very particular flavour that you will either love or hate. It combines the "punching people so hard they explode" of ultra-macho martial arts (<em>Fist of the North Star</em> is a strong inspiration) with extremely strong logic puzzles and plotting as the protagonist, Madarame Baku, bets his life on games.</p>\n<p>The characters are extremely memorable and the art is stylish, sometimes making characters look smooth and beautiful and sometimes making them look grotesque and terrifying. Most of these death game manga have a separate writer and artist because it\'s honestly very rare to find someone who can draw action scenes so effectively while also writing such a complex story. All the games are very "fair play", the reader is given all the clues necessary to determine the correct strategy or solution, and they are all extremely original. This very much isn\'t a character-driven story, but some of the character backstories can be surprisingly touching and emotional.</p>\n<p>Madarame Baku, the protagonist and titular "lie eater", isn\'t a self-insert character. Unlike a lot of death games, this isn\'t a story of a normal guy becoming a leader, or someone unfamiliar with a situation figuring out how to survive, this is the story of a world-class athlete going up against other seasoned winners, who are all complete maniacs, while the games are supervised by "referees" who provide the violence necessary to keep the games fair. The main appeal as a reader isn\'t just in watching Usogui win, it\'s in figuring out <em>how</em> he will win. What Usogui is actually up to, and why he is making these gambles, is slowly revealed and the story culminates after 540 chapters and 49 volumes in one final gamble that perfectly pulls all the storylines together. At no point does this manga slow down or get repetitive.</p>\n<p>There are some female referees, but there are very few female characters overall. Honestly, I think it\'s more honest not to have a token empty love interest character. However even though this manga doesn\'t go for cheap shock gore or lots of sexual content it feels like the horniest of the ones I\'ve listed here just because of how borderline erotic and intense the gambling and combat scenes are.</p>\n<p>The first chapter isn\'t a good introduction as it was originally written as a one-shot and some things were changed after the fact, but if you get through the first "Abandoned Building Game" storyline across the first two volumes it only gets better from there. <small>P.S. Marco is Best Boy and must be protected at all costs.</small></p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 10/10</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 5\xa0days, 15\xa0hours ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-08-making-tea" title="Making Tea">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-12-oct-week-2-digest" title="Oct Week 2 Digest">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'An overview of the death game trope, The Traitors tv show, and a rec list of manga with a similar premise.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-11-the-traitors-death-game-manga/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'An overview of the death game trope, The Traitors tv show, and a rec list of manga with a similar premise.'}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'manga', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'reading', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'review', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'the traitors', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'tv', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-11T15:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=11, tm_hour=15, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=5, tm_yday=284, tm_isdst=0)}

Which means it\'s time to start drinking more tea to keep my body and hands warm. Unfortunately, last year the motor burnt out on my long-serving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_water_boiler">hot water dispenser</a>. I bought it back in 2016 or so and aside from the year I was couchsurfing I\'ve been using it ever since. I drink less hot tea in the summer and boiling a kettle to make a pot of iced tea isn\'t that big of a deal. But now that I\'m back to continuously chaining large mugs of tea throughout the day I really notice it\'s absence.</p>\n<p>I\'m not big on "life hacking" per se the way it was popularized among nerds in the 2000s and 2010s, but I <em>am</em> interested in accommodations. I want to make life as easy for myself as possible. This means limiting wasted time, limiting the distance from a to b, removing unnecessary steps, making things I don\'t like doing convenient. I think I\'ve been doing this so long I have a hard time understanding people who <em>don\'t</em> do this. It\'s so sad to see people struggling unnecessarily with ideas of how things are Supposed to be done. And I really, really have a hard time living or working with or under people who insist there is One Correct Way to do things. I don\'t even like internet arguments over trivial things like how you\'re "supposed" to fold towels or whatever where people get mock outraged over other people doing things differently. When you\'ve lived with as many strangers as I have you have to have an open mind.</p>\n<p>All that to say, I drink a lot of tea. And so I am highly incentivized to make the process of making and drinking tea as smooth as possible. I think it\'s a good example of self-accommodation so that the world aligns with how my brain works rather than trying to make my brain fit into what the world considers standard.</p>\n<p>I didn\'t descale it often enough and our water here is super hard so even though I was running the water through a Brita filter before putting it in the motor got clogged and burnt out. I was able to diagnose the issue and even found a youtube video of someone taking apart a model very similar to mine to clean it, but I couldn\'t get into the motor, there was too much wiring and zipties in the way. I was going to take it to get repaired at a free repair café thing run periodically by one of the community organizations here, but you basically have to bring your thing there in the morning and wait in line and hope they will have time for you. So I never got up the energy to do it. Especially with the high chance the motor has burnt itself out and would need to be fully replaced. I\'m having a hard time justifying the expense of replacing it when using a kettle is Fine, I Guess, but now that winter is coming… It\'s less than two full price Switch games… (~$120 CAD for a decent 2L capacity Panasonic, $200 for a low end Zojirushi, $350 for a high end Zojirushi).</p>\n<details>Aside This is a test of the html details tag. This is one of those situations where I feel like I\'m bad at being poor. I\'m keenly aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory">Vimes Boot Theory</a> and my mother was an accountant so I am financially educated. I\'ll cut back on a lot of stuff and be really nitpicky about a dollar here or there with some things (I read four different grocery flyers every week to price compare), but with other things I\'ll put down "too much" money to get a decent product rather than just get by with the basic shit. Fundamentally, I don\'t think suffering is a virtue. </details>\n<p>So we\'re back to using the electric kettle, which feels like going back to the stone age. If you drink multiple cups of tea a day in your household and you have the money I would highly recommend getting a hot water dispenser. Like rice cookers, they are extremely common in Asian and Indian households, but most white people haven\'t caught on yet. When I\'ve met white Canadians who even know what I\'m talking about it\'s "oh we had one of those in our office". Even white Brits, famous for being tea drinkers, seem to consider them an absurd luxury rather than a normal kitchen appliance like a microwave.</p>\n<p>It\'s a simple technology. It\'s a heating coil under an urn and a temperature sensor and when the temperature of the water is below the sensor\'s set temperature it re-boils the water and then shuts off again. Then you press a button and hot water is pushed out by a small motor. The simplest ones are practically analog, you just push down on the top to use water displacement to force the water out (physics!). The simplest digital ones, like the one I had, have a button to push to set the temperature to one of three presets so if you don\'t actually want 100ºC like me you can set it to a more reasonable 80 or 90 and not scald yourself (and ruin your tea).</p>\n<p>If you use a kettle and think it\'s not that big of a deal to refill it and reboil it manually all day, I promise you it\'s life-changing. While I don\'t mind the ritual of having to go and boil a kettle and wait for it when I\'m working in an office (and therefore wasting time is essential to making it through the day), at home I want to get up and get more tea without losing my train of thought or having to go afk on FFXIV. With the hot water dispenser I could get up to refill my tea in the amount of time it takes Gaius to do his speech and have time left over.</p>\n<p>So going back to the self-accommodation, since this is something I do 10 times a day I want to make the process as smooth and thoughtless as possible.</p>\n<p>The kettle/hot water boiler is on the counter so I can reach it from the kitchen or the living room. With the water boiler I had a saucer under it to catch drips, with the kettle I keep a saucer next to it for putting used tea bags on. I also have a decorative bowl on the coffee table and on the desk to put more used tea bags in, or to set a strainer in. Over-steeped tea is not nice. I might want to re-use the bag later. And I know if I don\'t do this I will just put the teabag on the table itself and it will stain and get gross. This way when I do my tidying up at night before going to bed if the bowl is full I can take it all to the compost bag in the kitchen at once.</p>\n<p>When I had the hot water boiler I kept an off-brand Brita filter pitcher next to the fridge on the counter out of the way and would keep it full of water so that when the dispenser ran out of water I could just reach over and grab the pitcher and refill it, and then refill the pitcher. I teach every new roommate this process to try to extend the life of the machine.</p>\n<p>Prior to my current roommate and the way we have had to re-arrange the kitchen to accommodate <em>him</em> (he\'s short, most of the shelves are too high for him to reach) I also kept a box of the teabags that I use most often next to the water boiler. So I just need to have a mug, grab a teabag, add water, go back to what I\'m doing. There isn\'t really room to do that now so I have to go into a cupboard in the kitchen to get my tea and honestly just that extra step is annoying. I might move it somewhere else.</p>\n<p>I have plenty of nice loose teas in sealed containers and I keep a spoon in the cupboard with them for scooping it, along with the strainers and some powdered ginger. The mugs are on the shelf above the tea. The teas I use the most are closer to the front of the shelf and the other ones are in the back where it\'s harder to reach. I pretty much only drink varieties of Chinese green tea: jasmine, oolong, white tea, green tea. Sometimes a black tea or pu\'er or Earl Grey if I need the caffeine kick. Plus a ginger and turmeric mixed tisane that may or may not actually be good at settling the stomach but feels nice and isn\'t caffeinated.</p>\n<p>The tea I go through the most, though, is an imported brand called <a href="https://www.foodbasics.ca/aisles/beverages/tea-hot-drinks/green-tea/china-green-tea-bags/p/6945307400228">Hao Tea (Food Basics link)</a> that is sold in various Canadian chain supermarkets, often in the "international" section. This is the best price to value green tea you can easily get in Canada outside of import markets, the only competition is from the <a href="https://www.tntsupermarket.com/">T&amp;T supermarket house brand</a>, which sells <a href="https://www.tntsupermarket.com/eng/74789101-tnt-organic-green-tea-tea-bag-100s.html">100 bag boxes</a> of also quite decent jasmine, green, and oolong tea for a couple bucks more. Now that T&amp;T has been bought by Loblaws you can find it in some of the Loblaws stores. And maybe <a href="https://itoen.com/">Ito En</a>, although I see them around less.</p>\n<p>The point is, it\'s about $4.50 for a box of 100 bags of Hao Tea and it will taste better than Tetley or President\'s Choice or Twinings. It won\'t taste <em>as</em> good as loose leaf, but we\'re sacrificing quality for price and convenience. When I don\'t want to make a decision about what tea to have, I can just grab from the box of cheap green tea. As a bonus, they are wrapped in paper wrappers rather than plastic or foil so you can recycle them.</p>\n<p>I don\'t settle for just having the boxes on the shelf though. The Hao Tea boxes are meant to be stacked horizontally and have a flap lid that is just annoying. My method is to put it on it\'s side, rip off the flaps on one of the shorter sides of the rectangle, and tap the top flap closed. Now I can just reach in and take the tea bags out and as the number of tea bags goes down I can rip more of the cardboard off the box. Voilà, life hack. If this was nicer tea I would say you should keep it in an airtight container, but it isn\'t special tea and I\'m going to go through it too fast to be noticing oxidization.</p>\n<p>I\'ll spare you my rant on not using boiling water on green or white teas. But with a kettle you don\'t really get a choice unless you stand there and turn the kettle off just before it hits a rolling boil. So I have to add a bit of cold water from the kitchen sink to the boiling water to bring it down to a better temperature. I then put the teabag in and wrap the string around the handle so it doesn\'t fall in.</p>\n<p>Then I can go back to doing whatever I was going to do, if I haven\'t forgotten in the process of making the tea or gotten distracted. Once it\'s steeped enough I take the teabag out and put it in the nearest dish. I will drink that tea almost to the bottom and then get up and get more hot water, if it\'s still hot enough, and repeat that a few times. If I have to turn the kettle back on to re-boil the water manually and then go sit down again to wait for it I will 90% of the time forget to get back up to get it. But if I stand in the kitchen waiting for it, I <em>will</em> lose track of what I was doing.</p>\n<p>I decided to keep track today of how much tea I actually drank so I filled the kettle to 1L exactly and haven\'t refilled it. After 3.5 hours I\'ve drank about 700 ml of tea. 200ml per hour. Which isn\'t too bad, I guess? I was expecting it to be worse, but that is also including time where I ran out of tea and turned on the kettle and then forgot about the kettle. My doctor worried I get too much caffeine from this tea habit, but now that I\'m officially on prescription stimulants I think it\'s apparent that they don\'t actually do much to me. I also would not characterize it as an addiction, because I can perfectly happily switch to drinking mostly water and cold tisanes and watered down iced tea all summer.</p>\n<p>So that, in a very extremely roundabout way, is my optimized tea-making process. And I will be watching my camelcamelcamel price tracker to see if <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01CEK4NHE/">a mid-range Panasonic hot water boiler (Amazon link)</a> goes on sale for Black Friday.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 1\xa0week, 3\xa0days ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-08-fantasy-life-i-130-hr-update" title="Fantasy Life i - 130 hr update">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-11-the-traitors-death-game-manga" title="The Traitors &amp; Death Game Manga">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'A recommendation of hot water dispensers, cheap green tea brands, and description of my tea-making process™.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-08-making-tea/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'A recommendation of hot water dispensers, cheap green tea brands, and description of my tea-making process™.'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'cooking', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'journal', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-08T22:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=22, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=281, tm_isdst=0)}

But the crafters all require rare materials, some of which only drop from monsters I haven\'t even seen yet. So I have to progress the story some more and keep working on Girnomosia.</p>\n<p>I cleared the dark castle in Ginormosia and revealed the secret of the island. Destroyed the crystal. I assume this will make the final boss fight easier. I didn\'t have any trouble with the monsters in there, and I liked the design the most of all the dungeons we\'ve had so far.</p>\n<p>I\'ve gotten all the regions up to rank 4 but now trying to get them up to 5 is slooowwww. Except for the region with the vegetable fields, because I always take advantage of that when it respawns that region is almost maxed out. I\'ve gotten three others up to rank 5 and some elemental trees and new legendary fish and high level boss enemies have appeared. But I mostly just keep getting the legendary fish spawning. Like, thanks for the points and exp but I don\'t need you any more take a hint, let the other legendaries spawn.</p>\n<p>I also looked up where the last legendary tool was that I didn\'t have the recipe for yet and it was in a cave I somehow completely overlooked. But now I have all of those. I\'ve crafted the Legendary Hammer tool for Blacksmith to start with, but it\'s going to be slow going getting the materials for the others with how rarely things spawn. Maybe I need to be cheating slightly and forcing respawns by toggling the towers back and forth to different ranks until I get what I want.</p>\n<p>I\'ve gotten 49 of 50 Strangelings and some fun recognizable characters from the first game. I also have 49 of 51 characters, so there must be one more story character to recruit. But I don\'t know if I\'ve missed a shrine or one of the Strangelings that are just randomly out in the world somewhere. I\'ll have to look it up.</p>\n<p>I turned in the materials required for the final guild shop upgrade, so that\'s done. I\'ll have to see what else I need to do to get the island up to the final rank.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I fought the muscles guy in the Coliseum. It was the closest I\'ve been to actually dying in a fight in this game, but since I mostly play Magician I just stayed out of range and blasted him while occasionally healing the team until he was worn down. I thought that was the last Coliseum fight but apparently there\'s one more. I\'ve been fighting level 70 enemies in Ginormosia so it should be possible…?</p>\n<p>I suppose I should do the final story battle soon. I don\'t think it\'s a great idea story wise to have all this backstory only revealed in optional content at the very end of the game, but I suppose you don\'t really need to know why the Big Bad is the way he is. It\'s a simplistic story anyway.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 1\xa0week, 3\xa0days ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-07-bearblog-custom-colours" title="Bearblog Customization: Colours">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-08-making-tea" title="Making Tea">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Some Lives hit Hero rank, clearing the Dark Castle, ranking up more regions in Ginormosia, a Colliseum win, and other grinding.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-08-fantasy-life-i-130-hr-update/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Some Lives hit Hero rank, clearing the Dark Castle, ranking up more regions in Ginormosia, a Colliseum win, and other grinding.'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'fantasy life i', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'video games', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-08T17:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=17, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=281, tm_isdst=0)}

It shows the completion rates for the new main story added with patch 7.5 (that was <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/06/desperate-defiance-now-were-getting.html">Desperate Defiance</a>) compared to the four date nights that were added in the previous patch (for Lana, Theron, Arcann and Koth).</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUXLsalcbbyAEIl-E-s6TwerJXtfsougkZpsv_lrAlnTGytUWCS9nVYc83kzVeJpNBB0KVBSSDbMBHrtmbc3BHDqXfAK6XEtXLIJLsP2Twk9KA4kiUKShOJA_8o8O-MKknrlbQJQnwU9QlYs1VTehaJpbe385M81b29Xl0-arPo8kyYD385FxQ1Wgr_L8/s1906/Date%20night%20analytics.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="226" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUXLsalcbbyAEIl-E-s6TwerJXtfsougkZpsv_lrAlnTGytUWCS9nVYc83kzVeJpNBB0KVBSSDbMBHrtmbc3BHDqXfAK6XEtXLIJLsP2Twk9KA4kiUKShOJA_8o8O-MKknrlbQJQnwU9QlYs1VTehaJpbe385M81b29Xl0-arPo8kyYD385FxQ1Wgr_L8/w400-h226/Date%20night%20analytics.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />It shows that 30 days after release, more players had completed at least one of the available date nights than 7.5\'s story. Now, you could argue that maybe that\'s not an entirely fair comparison, seeing how date night missions only take about five minutes and are available to anyone who\'s completed the "Knights of" expansions, while 7.5 required your character to be all caught up with several years of additional story updates added since then (plus it also took more time to complete). Nonetheless...<p></p><p>I thought this was quite impressive. As someone who\'s generally less interested in the romance aspect of the game compared to others, I was kind of surprised just how popular these were. Also that Lana looks to be about twice as popular as any of the other three companions in this comparison, but then I guess she\'s the only woman running against three men. I guess this is why those of us who aren\'t that crazy about Lana will never be able to get rid of her... (I\'m joking. Mostly.)</p><p>I suspect that the numbers for the date nights released after that must have been less exciting, considering that all the other companions are limited to specific classes as opposed to being available to everyone. Personally I still haven\'t done any beyond <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/03/date-night-with-theron-and-arcann.html">Theron and Arcann</a>, as I just don\'t have the right combination of characters far enough progressed through the story. One day I guess...</p><p>Anyway, I just thought that was an interesting little insight into content performance, of the type that devs usually don\'t share with players (while at the same time we as players love to get our hands on it - as was also evidenced by all the excitement about <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/03/wows-post-wod-sub-numbers.html" target="_blank">John Hight\'s leaked slide about WoW subscriptions from his GDC presentation last year</a>).</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>Earlier in the year, Narrative Director Ashley Ruhl <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ashleyruhl.bsky.social/post/3lkofbf4i722s" target="_blank">gave a talk at 2025\'s Game Developers Conference</a>, on the subject of SWTOR\'s date nights.

It shows the completion rates for the new main story added with patch 7.5 (that was <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/06/desperate-defiance-now-were-getting.html">Desperate Defiance</a>) compared to the four date nights that were added in the previous patch (for Lana, Theron, Arcann and Koth).</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUXLsalcbbyAEIl-E-s6TwerJXtfsougkZpsv_lrAlnTGytUWCS9nVYc83kzVeJpNBB0KVBSSDbMBHrtmbc3BHDqXfAK6XEtXLIJLsP2Twk9KA4kiUKShOJA_8o8O-MKknrlbQJQnwU9QlYs1VTehaJpbe385M81b29Xl0-arPo8kyYD385FxQ1Wgr_L8/s1906/Date%20night%20analytics.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="226" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUXLsalcbbyAEIl-E-s6TwerJXtfsougkZpsv_lrAlnTGytUWCS9nVYc83kzVeJpNBB0KVBSSDbMBHrtmbc3BHDqXfAK6XEtXLIJLsP2Twk9KA4kiUKShOJA_8o8O-MKknrlbQJQnwU9QlYs1VTehaJpbe385M81b29Xl0-arPo8kyYD385FxQ1Wgr_L8/w400-h226/Date%20night%20analytics.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />It shows that 30 days after release, more players had completed at least one of the available date nights than 7.5\'s story. Now, you could argue that maybe that\'s not an entirely fair comparison, seeing how date night missions only take about five minutes and are available to anyone who\'s completed the "Knights of" expansions, while 7.5 required your character to be all caught up with several years of additional story updates added since then (plus it also took more time to complete). Nonetheless...<p></p><p>I thought this was quite impressive. As someone who\'s generally less interested in the romance aspect of the game compared to others, I was kind of surprised just how popular these were. Also that Lana looks to be about twice as popular as any of the other three companions in this comparison, but then I guess she\'s the only woman running against three men. I guess this is why those of us who aren\'t that crazy about Lana will never be able to get rid of her... (I\'m joking. Mostly.)</p><p>I suspect that the numbers for the date nights released after that must have been less exciting, considering that all the other companions are limited to specific classes as opposed to being available to everyone. Personally I still haven\'t done any beyond <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/03/date-night-with-theron-and-arcann.html">Theron and Arcann</a>, as I just don\'t have the right combination of characters far enough progressed through the story. One day I guess...</p><p>Anyway, I just thought that was an interesting little insight into content performance, of the type that devs usually don\'t share with players (while at the same time we as players love to get our hands on it - as was also evidenced by all the excitement about <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/03/wows-post-wod-sub-numbers.html" target="_blank">John Hight\'s leaked slide about WoW subscriptions from his GDC presentation last year</a>).</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/10/date-night-data.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/10/date-night-data.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUXLsalcbbyAEIl-E-s6TwerJXtfsougkZpsv_lrAlnTGytUWCS9nVYc83kzVeJpNBB0KVBSSDbMBHrtmbc3BHDqXfAK6XEtXLIJLsP2Twk9KA4kiUKShOJA_8o8O-MKknrlbQJQnwU9QlYs1VTehaJpbe385M81b29Xl0-arPo8kyYD385FxQ1Wgr_L8/s72-w400-h226-c/Date%20night%20analytics.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '3'}

You see, the western ice shelf where the Gree visit nowadays used to be a dedicated PvP area. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JNT33oSXjE" target="_blank">This brief video by Force Gaming</a> should give you an idea of how it was <i>supposed</i> to work. It was released about two weeks after launch, and the video notes that at the time, people were just flipping objectives and not much PvP was going on. This was "fixed" with a patch... that in turn <a href="https://spinksville.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/swtor-the-oops-we-just-broke-high-level-world-pvp-patch/" target="_blank">broke the area in a whole bunch of other ways</a>. The result were crazy AoE fests that the game\'s engine couldn\'t deal with very well, which caused people to gain valour way too fast, even as they were just dying over and over in the mayhem. It was just chaos and caused endless complaints.</p><p>Once again, this is something I didn\'t actually get to experience directly, as I took my time levelling and didn\'t get to Ilum until about three months later, by which time all the craziness had already died down. In January 2013, I actually wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-strangeness-of-ilum-year-later.html">The strangeness of Ilum a year later</a>", but in those first weeks after launch, it was seemingly all people would talk about on forums and news sites, about how this newly launched MMO clearly didn\'t know how to deal with PvP and was therefore already failing horribly.</p><p><b>The original Rakghoul event</b></p><p>The recurring Rakghoul Resurgence event is probably old hat to most of you at this point - just another world event that comes around every so often and which has been around for what feels like forever. The very first Rakghoul event in April 2012 though... that was something else. The activities it came with weren\'t really any more exciting than what we have in the repeating event, but the vibe was very different and unique, mainly because we had no idea it was coming.</p><p>The game was still very new at the time, had a lot going on and we were getting patches and updates about more patches all the time... but this came as a complete surprise, and the experience of everyone being confused about what was going on and slowly figuring things out over the course of the first day was unique and exciting in a way that I think is hard to convey nowadays. You can read <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/world-event.html">the blog post I wrote about it at the time</a> to get an idea though. (I also wrote <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-plague-day-4.html">two</a> <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-event-end.html">follow-ups</a>.)</p><p>Ultimately the fact that it was a time-limited one-off was also one of the biggest criticisms Bioware received, which is why they eventually swapped to making new events recurring. The Rakghouls would eventually join the rotation in <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-rakghouls-are-here.html">early 2014</a>.</p><p><b>The Grand Acquisitions Race</b></p><p>The Grand Acquisitions Race (sometimes also referred to as "the Chevin event") was SWTOR\'s second one-time world event, and a lot less exciting than the original Rakghoul incursion on Tatooine. One reason for this was that <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/world-event-take-2.html">we actually knew that it was coming</a>, even if we didn\'t know the details. The second reason however was that it was simply <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-grand-acquisitions-race-in-review.html">a lot less exciting in terms of activities</a>, as all there was to do was a time-gated puzzle quest chain and farming currency crates on Nar Shaddaa. I have to chuckle a bit when I occasionally see people say that this event should be brought back. People didn\'t even care about it that much when the game was still in its heyday and a limited-time world event was something exciting! Still, I guess my point is you had to be there to know just how underwhelming it really was.</p><p><b>The return of Revan</b></p><p>I think this one might be a bit hard to parse for anyone who started playing after 2014. We all&nbsp;know Revan is in the game, right? There\'s a whole expansion called "Shadow of Revan", no? Well, for a moment, try to imagine that there wasn\'t. Revan is in the game, but only in this weird side quest that you\'ll only see if you like doing group content, and he\'s a prisoner one moment and a genocidal maniac the next, and if you blink you\'ll miss him dying as well. Also note that you had to have levelled through and done group content <i>on both factions</i> to be able to make sense of this brief cameo, something which fans of the original KotOR were not at all happy about.</p><p>Then it\'s 2014 - we\'ve been level 55 for a bit over a year, got several new daily areas and raids, everything\'s kind of chugging along nicely if you\'re not dying for your character\'s personal story to be continued... and then we start getting <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/04/assault-on-tython-and-korriban.html">a new series of flashpoints</a> that\'s being promoted as a new story arc called "Forged Alliances". That Theron guy is kinda cute, but aside from that it\'s all a bit mysterious. Who are these new troublemakers in the shadows? The answer came <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/09/legacy-of-rakata.html">in September</a>, in a post in which I felt the need to give a spoiler warning.</p><p>Whoa, Revan is back? Revan is <i>alive</i>? Is it really him though? And then <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/10/quick-30-announcement-thoughts.html">a whole expansion with his name</a>! It was exciting times for a while, showing once again that Revan\'s name still attracted the crowds. I think reception of the expansion storyline was ultimately a bit mixed - it gave the character a better send-off than the base game had for sure, but it was still a bit awkward in the eyes of some.</p><p><b>The launch of Knights of the Fallen Empire</b></p><p>Did you realise that we\'re less than a month away from the KotFE expansion turning ten years old? I\'m sure I\'m not the only long-time player who still thinks of everything pre-KotFE as the good old days, and everything that came after it as "the new stuff". It is after all a fact that it changed the game in bigger ways than perhaps anything that came afterwards, with the introduction of features like level sync or its complete overhaul of the companion system.</p><p>Still, I\'m not even talking about all of that. What made KotFE\'s launch a "you had to be there" moment was just <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/06/fallen-empire-stuff.html">how absolutely insane the hype was</a>. A new CGI trailer for the first time since launch! Accidental leaks with announcements that could be interpreted in multiple possible ways! General Star Wars hype as <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-star-wars-hype-is-building-up.html">we were all looking forward to the sequel trilogy</a>! (Oops.) Absolute mayhem!</p><p>And when it came out, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/10/knights-of-fallen-empires-story-is.html">people (including me) did indeed love it</a>! Mainstream gaming sites were like "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/knights-of-the-fallen-empire-a-great-solo-star-wars-story/" target="_blank">hey, this game still exists and is good</a>"! It felt like we were all set for a big SWTOR renaissance... except it all fizzled out within a couple of months. People thought the story was neat, but they didn\'t want to hang around to wait for one new chapter per month. They felt there wasn\'t enough to do at endgame. And those of us who <i>did</i> stick around quickly found out how tedious the new story was to play through on alts, never mind the plot going in directions that became more and more aggravating. For the second time in its life, SWTOR had released (something) with a lot of hype and then failed to live up to it.</p><p><b>Galactic Command</b></p><p>For anyone who might not know, Galactic Command was a new gearing/endgame progression system introduced&nbsp;with the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion, and in its original iteration, it was the worst system of its kind that I\'ve personally ever seen. To add insult to injury, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/10/galactic-command-bioware-trying-to.html">people (including me) were telling them from the moment it was announced that it was a bad idea</a>, but the devs were all "nah, it\'ll work and be fun, you\'ll see".</p><p>It didn\'t and it wasn\'t. For me, the early days of Galactic Command <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/12/control-alt-escape.html">were one of my all-time low points with the game</a>. Fortunately the devs scrambled to fix it immediately after launch, but it took about six months to get it into what could be described as an "acceptable" state and many players <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/11/galactic-command-is-alright-now.html">held a grudge long after</a>. It\'s another one of those things that in hindsight makes you wonder what could\'ve been <i>sooo</i> bad about it, but if you were there, you know.</p><p><b>Theron\'s betrayal</b></p><p>I did say there were spoilers in here,&nbsp;didn\'t I?&nbsp;I think looking at the game\'s storylines as a whole, the Fractured Alliances story (consisting of the three flashpoints Crisis on Umbara, Traitor Among the Chiss and The Nathema Conspiracy) is probably not among many people\'s favourites. The writing definitely felt like it had dug itself into a bit of a hole with Knights of the Eternal Throne, and it wasn\'t clear how it was going to get out of it.</p><p>I actually think that Fractured Alliances ultimately succeeded in what it set out to do, but it\'s fair to say that it was a bumpy ride. One thing I really did enjoy about it though was the community interactions it created. Theron\'s betrayal in Crisis on Umbara was not well-received for a <i>variety</i> of reasons, but it was interesting to watch the conversation around it evolve as more people started to believe that the whole thing was just a ruse. In hindsight, there are some hints towards this from the beginning, but they were easy to overlook at first.</p><p>People just didn\'t want their love interest to betray them, and there was even a hashtag called #believeintheron making the rounds on Twitter. I remember seeing screenshots of people assembling on Odessen with all their Therons out and forming a heart-shape or something. I just thought that was very cool, and actually kind of made me more invested in the final outcome than the story itself would have been able to do on its own.</p><p><b>Darth Malgus\' return</b></p><p>Back in 2017, I wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/10/11-npcs-that-died-before-their-time.html">11 NPCs That Died Before Their Time</a>" and Darth Malgus was second on my list. I just couldn\'t believe that they put him in all the cinematic trailers and then simply had him get killed off in one of the first endgame flashpoints! I\'m not sure I was aware at the time that there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajDDJDY0Y-k" target="_blank">a supposedly deleted scene from the KotFE trailer</a> that showed Malgus being delivered to Valkorion, frozen in a block of carbonite. Even if I was, it seemed obvious at the time that they\'d deleted it for a reason and for all intents and purposes, Malgus was still considered dead.</p><p>When he really did come back with the Ossus update at the end of 2018, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-return-of-spoiler.html">I absolutely loved it</a>. It was a really well-presented surprise, and while I don\'t think it was as big as the return of Revan, for me personally it was actually <i>more</i> meaningful than that had been. It\'s hard to think that it\'s already been seven years since then - at this point it feels like it should be obvious to everyone playing the game in any capacity at all that Darth Malgus is alive. However, that moment when we first found out was definitely special. (Cue some comment about how he\'s unfortunately outstayed his welcome since then.)</p><p><b>Move to Broadsword</b></p><p>Two years ago, when <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/swtor-to-move-from-bioware-to-broadsword.html">IGN leaked the news that Star Wars: The Old Republic was going to be transferred from Bioware to some largely unknown studio called Broadsword Entertainment</a>, all hell broke loose in the community for a few weeks.&nbsp;I think dedicated SWTOR players are quite used to endless doom-saying about the game and are well-practised at ignoring it by this point, but this sounded serious, and it was not at all clear what the consequences were going to be.</p><p>To me it was probably more worrying than even the original free-to-play announcement had been, and I found myself seeking solace in spending a lot more time than usual talking to fellow content creators. I also felt compelled to try and do my own part by practising something vaguely resembling journalism, which meant assembling information from different sources and trying to put it into context for people. In hindsight it seems almost silly how much we worried, considering how little changed from a player perspective after the studio transition, but at the time it was big news.</p><p><b>Runner-ups:</b></p><p>I could\'ve tried to come up with even more stories, but I thought that 10 was a good number to stop at. Nonetheless, here are three more events that I considered mentioning but decided against because they were mostly negative but also ultimately not <i>that</i> interesting to talk about in detail in my opinion:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The original free-to-play transition</li><li>The Legacy of the Sith expansion launch</li><li>The whole <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/character-modernisation-panic-on-pts.html">character texture update</a> drama</li></ul><p>Which of all of these events were you personally around for?

People didn\'t even care about it that much when the game was still in its heyday and a limited-time world event was something exciting! Still, I guess my point is you had to be there to know just how underwhelming it really was.</p><p><b>The return of Revan</b></p><p>I think this one might be a bit hard to parse for anyone who started playing after 2014. We all&nbsp;know Revan is in the game, right? There\'s a whole expansion called "Shadow of Revan", no? Well, for a moment, try to imagine that there wasn\'t. Revan is in the game, but only in this weird side quest that you\'ll only see if you like doing group content, and he\'s a prisoner one moment and a genocidal maniac the next, and if you blink you\'ll miss him dying as well. Also note that you had to have levelled through and done group content <i>on both factions</i> to be able to make sense of this brief cameo, something which fans of the original KotOR were not at all happy about.</p><p>Then it\'s 2014 - we\'ve been level 55 for a bit over a year, got several new daily areas and raids, everything\'s kind of chugging along nicely if you\'re not dying for your character\'s personal story to be continued... and then we start getting <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/04/assault-on-tython-and-korriban.html">a new series of flashpoints</a> that\'s being promoted as a new story arc called "Forged Alliances". That Theron guy is kinda cute, but aside from that it\'s all a bit mysterious. Who are these new troublemakers in the shadows? The answer came <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/09/legacy-of-rakata.html">in September</a>, in a post in which I felt the need to give a spoiler warning.</p><p>Whoa, Revan is back? Revan is <i>alive</i>? Is it really him though? And then <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/10/quick-30-announcement-thoughts.html">a whole expansion with his name</a>! It was exciting times for a while, showing once again that Revan\'s name still attracted the crowds. I think reception of the expansion storyline was ultimately a bit mixed - it gave the character a better send-off than the base game had for sure, but it was still a bit awkward in the eyes of some.</p><p><b>The launch of Knights of the Fallen Empire</b></p><p>Did you realise that we\'re less than a month away from the KotFE expansion turning ten years old? I\'m sure I\'m not the only long-time player who still thinks of everything pre-KotFE as the good old days, and everything that came after it as "the new stuff". It is after all a fact that it changed the game in bigger ways than perhaps anything that came afterwards, with the introduction of features like level sync or its complete overhaul of the companion system.</p><p>Still, I\'m not even talking about all of that. What made KotFE\'s launch a "you had to be there" moment was just <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/06/fallen-empire-stuff.html">how absolutely insane the hype was</a>. A new CGI trailer for the first time since launch! Accidental leaks with announcements that could be interpreted in multiple possible ways! General Star Wars hype as <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-star-wars-hype-is-building-up.html">we were all looking forward to the sequel trilogy</a>! (Oops.) Absolute mayhem!</p><p>And when it came out, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/10/knights-of-fallen-empires-story-is.html">people (including me) did indeed love it</a>! Mainstream gaming sites were like "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/knights-of-the-fallen-empire-a-great-solo-star-wars-story/" target="_blank">hey, this game still exists and is good</a>"! It felt like we were all set for a big SWTOR renaissance... except it all fizzled out within a couple of months. People thought the story was neat, but they didn\'t want to hang around to wait for one new chapter per month. They felt there wasn\'t enough to do at endgame. And those of us who <i>did</i> stick around quickly found out how tedious the new story was to play through on alts, never mind the plot going in directions that became more and more aggravating. For the second time in its life, SWTOR had released (something) with a lot of hype and then failed to live up to it.</p><p><b>Galactic Command</b></p><p>For anyone who might not know, Galactic Command was a new gearing/endgame progression system introduced&nbsp;with the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion, and in its original iteration, it was the worst system of its kind that I\'ve personally ever seen. To add insult to injury, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/10/galactic-command-bioware-trying-to.html">people (including me) were telling them from the moment it was announced that it was a bad idea</a>, but the devs were all "nah, it\'ll work and be fun, you\'ll see".</p><p>It didn\'t and it wasn\'t. For me, the early days of Galactic Command <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/12/control-alt-escape.html">were one of my all-time low points with the game</a>. Fortunately the devs scrambled to fix it immediately after launch, but it took about six months to get it into what could be described as an "acceptable" state and many players <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/11/galactic-command-is-alright-now.html">held a grudge long after</a>. It\'s another one of those things that in hindsight makes you wonder what could\'ve been <i>sooo</i> bad about it, but if you were there, you know.</p><p><b>Theron\'s betrayal</b></p><p>I did say there were spoilers in here,&nbsp;didn\'t I?&nbsp;I think looking at the game\'s storylines as a whole, the Fractured Alliances story (consisting of the three flashpoints Crisis on Umbara, Traitor Among the Chiss and The Nathema Conspiracy) is probably not among many people\'s favourites. The writing definitely felt like it had dug itself into a bit of a hole with Knights of the Eternal Throne, and it wasn\'t clear how it was going to get out of it.</p><p>I actually think that Fractured Alliances ultimately succeeded in what it set out to do, but it\'s fair to say that it was a bumpy ride. One thing I really did enjoy about it though was the community interactions it created. Theron\'s betrayal in Crisis on Umbara was not well-received for a <i>variety</i> of reasons, but it was interesting to watch the conversation around it evolve as more people started to believe that the whole thing was just a ruse. In hindsight, there are some hints towards this from the beginning, but they were easy to overlook at first.</p><p>People just didn\'t want their love interest to betray them, and there was even a hashtag called #believeintheron making the rounds on Twitter. I remember seeing screenshots of people assembling on Odessen with all their Therons out and forming a heart-shape or something. I just thought that was very cool, and actually kind of made me more invested in the final outcome than the story itself would have been able to do on its own.</p><p><b>Darth Malgus\' return</b></p><p>Back in 2017, I wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/10/11-npcs-that-died-before-their-time.html">11 NPCs That Died Before Their Time</a>" and Darth Malgus was second on my list. I just couldn\'t believe that they put him in all the cinematic trailers and then simply had him get killed off in one of the first endgame flashpoints! I\'m not sure I was aware at the time that there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajDDJDY0Y-k" target="_blank">a supposedly deleted scene from the KotFE trailer</a> that showed Malgus being delivered to Valkorion, frozen in a block of carbonite. Even if I was, it seemed obvious at the time that they\'d deleted it for a reason and for all intents and purposes, Malgus was still considered dead.</p><p>When he really did come back with the Ossus update at the end of 2018, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-return-of-spoiler.html">I absolutely loved it</a>. It was a really well-presented surprise, and while I don\'t think it was as big as the return of Revan, for me personally it was actually <i>more</i> meaningful than that had been. It\'s hard to think that it\'s already been seven years since then - at this point it feels like it should be obvious to everyone playing the game in any capacity at all that Darth Malgus is alive. However, that moment when we first found out was definitely special. (Cue some comment about how he\'s unfortunately outstayed his welcome since then.)</p><p><b>Move to Broadsword</b></p><p>Two years ago, when <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/swtor-to-move-from-bioware-to-broadsword.html">IGN leaked the news that Star Wars: The Old Republic was going to be transferred from Bioware to some largely unknown studio called Broadsword Entertainment</a>, all hell broke loose in the community for a few weeks.&nbsp;I think dedicated SWTOR players are quite used to endless doom-saying about the game and are well-practised at ignoring it by this point, but this sounded serious, and it was not at all clear what the consequences were going to be.</p><p>To me it was probably more worrying than even the original free-to-play announcement had been, and I found myself seeking solace in spending a lot more time than usual talking to fellow content creators. I also felt compelled to try and do my own part by practising something vaguely resembling journalism, which meant assembling information from different sources and trying to put it into context for people. In hindsight it seems almost silly how much we worried, considering how little changed from a player perspective after the studio transition, but at the time it was big news.</p><p><b>Runner-ups:</b></p><p>I could\'ve tried to come up with even more stories, but I thought that 10 was a good number to stop at. Nonetheless, here are three more events that I considered mentioning but decided against because they were mostly negative but also ultimately not <i>that</i> interesting to talk about in detail in my opinion:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The original free-to-play transition</li><li>The Legacy of the Sith expansion launch</li><li>The whole <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/character-modernisation-panic-on-pts.html">character texture update</a> drama</li></ul><p>Which of all of these events were you personally around for? Do you agree with my characterisation of how things went down? Are there any other major events in the game\'s history that you would\'ve included on this list?</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/10-moments-in-swtors-history-for-which.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/10-moments-in-swtors-history-for-which.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcsNcSxsfLhqSOCaVxJ1NWyLqP7L1d0CpzEKRIBtfDaSk-qki1XmEbXD298DqygHNtvzeinCG5LPio-Lfhykc8VHK5o4NA8R5o4FR3PeNiivndjqvOTvp8p7wP_RwslOKqfAELchTtXMzIVcPGmzMqh4rSicws7DVUaamRntcOPi3KRkceF2sv2MZ3H7A/s72-w99-h400-c/Getdown%20battle.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '13'}

I\'m not saying that people <i>should</i> be upset or anything, it\'s just... part of me does bristle a bit at how gamers as a whole have been slow-cooked into finding real money translating into in-game power less and less objectionable. Which does include me by the way!</p><p>I know I\'m going to use these tokens to buy my alts on the other servers some better gear (since the login rewards are per server, not account-wide), and I can\'t argue with the people who\'ve told me that it\'s not a big deal, considering that Rakata has been our endgame gear for three and a half years now - not to mention that SWTOR is generally not a game focused on grinding gear anyway. I just can\'t quite shake the feeling that it does still feel a little wrong <i>somehow</i> at the same time.</p><p>Anyway, if you\'ve ever wanted endgame gear in SWTOR just for subscribing and logging in, now\'s your chance. With each Rakata piece only costing 2 tokens, you could be fully kitted out after four weeks.</p><p>What I\'m actually interested in (though I doubt we\'ll find out) is how much of an impact this is going to have on subscriptions. I was recently told by someone that according to some financial report, SWTOR\'s revenue was pretty steady, but subscriptions have been down lately and more money has come in through microtransactions instead. While I haven\'t been able to verify a source for this, it does at least sound plausible if you think about it.</p><p>What are reasons to subscribe nowadays? You need to be a subscriber to do operations, but that\'s a system that receives relatively little support and new content. I\'m sure many people sub up for at least a month to check out the newest story updates every so often, but due to the voice actors\' strike, we haven\'t had a new installment of <i>that</i> since June last year. And they just removed a bunch of free-to-play restrictions that were meant to annoy people into subscribing as well. (Which I do think is a good thing for the game, holistically speaking, but I would still also expect it to lead to at least a slight drop in subscriptions in the short term.) So unless SWTOR is one of your main hobbies and you\'re constantly subscribed because of that (as is the case for me), incentives to become a new sub have been pretty weak for a while.</p><p>I guess Galactic Seasons have been another reason, since you need to be a subscriber to unlock <i>all</i> the rewards... but that\'s not a lot.

With each Rakata piece only costing 2 tokens, you could be fully kitted out after four weeks.</p><p>What I\'m actually interested in (though I doubt we\'ll find out) is how much of an impact this is going to have on subscriptions. I was recently told by someone that according to some financial report, SWTOR\'s revenue was pretty steady, but subscriptions have been down lately and more money has come in through microtransactions instead. While I haven\'t been able to verify a source for this, it does at least sound plausible if you think about it.</p><p>What are reasons to subscribe nowadays? You need to be a subscriber to do operations, but that\'s a system that receives relatively little support and new content. I\'m sure many people sub up for at least a month to check out the newest story updates every so often, but due to the voice actors\' strike, we haven\'t had a new installment of <i>that</i> since June last year. And they just removed a bunch of free-to-play restrictions that were meant to annoy people into subscribing as well. (Which I do think is a good thing for the game, holistically speaking, but I would still also expect it to lead to at least a slight drop in subscriptions in the short term.) So unless SWTOR is one of your main hobbies and you\'re constantly subscribed because of that (as is the case for me), incentives to become a new sub have been pretty weak for a while.</p><p>I guess Galactic Seasons have been another reason, since you need to be a subscriber to unlock <i>all</i> the rewards... but that\'s not a lot. For the game\'s sake, I hope that these new rewards find an audience.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/subscriber-login-event.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/subscriber-login-event.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWR7RA_aPyOZi65LF_K35f4vq5BJsGKfVuLfuPYi6Ol9p1SsTsuUC1BgmqQOtNvQh50gzS6bfax4HG7bvyf1Tq-2eUCIQ8xz9Cj8njyjiv9goES4BSXFNUTtjF8D_RR4gTZUcfmNlGpgXU74lZzJj6cUc3Qm3uDx4Z4GsCgcAm87Awr98lRfNHqfe8L-w/s72-w400-h118-c/Subscriber%20event%20login%20reward.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

While my initial reaction was skewing towards slightly negative, I was telling myself that this is probably one of those cases where I\'m just a weird outlier for liking something (group conversations in pug flashpoints) that many people don\'t like, and that I\'ll see the benefits of this change soon enough. I still remember <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-czerka-flashpoints-in-review.html">when the Czerka flashpoints first came out</a>&nbsp;back in 2013, I was actually somewhat disappointed at first that they were so streamlined without any interactive cut scenes, but I got over that pretty quickly.</p><p>One of the seasons objectives this week was to run either the Black Talon or the Esseles on veteran mode via the group finder, and with me doing Galactic Seasons on all servers I had plenty of opportunity to see the new change in action. For the most part, the experience was... fine. I\'m not going to pretend that I would have had so much more fun if I\'d gotten the full cut scene experience six times instead of the new fade to black thing. Primarily, it was all just kind of <i>weird</i>, with a lot of running back and forth with no discernible purpose when you don\'t actually have the story cut scenes to tell you what is happening.</p><p>There was one run that really annoyed me though. I got into an Esseles on a level 80 healer, and the other three members of the group were a level 80 dps, a level 10 and a level 14. I don\'t know if the two lowbies were new players or just alts, but either way they were subject to certain limitations at their low level, such as slower speed and lacking strong AoE abilities or defensives. Yet the level 80 was constantly mounting up and driving ahead, aggroing absolutely everything to pull it into a corner at the end, while the rest of us slowly jogged after them on foot. (I would\'ve been able to keep up more but I felt it was my duty to protect the lowbies, who would\'ve died several times if I hadn\'t healed them.)</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimdkGSdQiSS4eey0f_KQQR3sjZQc7opi2V6jnxakFbjNK6yJWa4tyEMsIlbA8XLuRqKFsYTtTQQEII7EpkfSR4E80GwU22CJrs5g_dFowEL44LXMuXxjBgkejuhPPZdutfZ0C3suWotuun1gT8_nTZetUXg6BBwFj1ckgC-RR4XL0MNhrLFRKho5AbC2Q/s300/Rushy%20player%20in%20the%20Esseles.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A chat screenshot from SWTOR.

I got the impression that at least one of them got a bit flustered by that and tried to overcompensate by mounting up and rushing ahead even of the level 80 at one point, just to then be told off because not everyone had made it up the elevator yet when we were put into combat as a result of that (which was technically correct but also must\'ve been confusing in terms of mixed messages).</p><p>I got really annoyed with that level 80\'s attitude but didn\'t say anything because frankly I was quite busy just keeping up with their constant running myself, as well as just keeping everyone else alive. I simply did what I could to support the lowbies, such as when one of them veered off towards the bonus boss while the 80 was just trying to go straight to the end. I just kept hoping that neither of the little guys were genuinely new players because if I had been a newbie in that situation, I would have been <i>so</i> put off from running flashpoints ever again.</p><p>Now, to be clear, all of this technically has nothing to do with the cut scene change, because people could act like that while the group conversations were still a thing. However, at least the cut scenes would put the brakes on things a little bit. They were a reminder that this flashpoint wasn\'t <i>designed</i> to be rushed like that. And I feel that the removal of the cut scenes does the opposite now, vindicating people like that level 80 in the sense that yes, the devs agree with you that flashpoints are something to get over and done with as quickly as possible. I feel like my opinion was validated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1mvj1j5/group_finder_flashpoint_skippers_are_insatiable/">a thread on the SWTOR subreddit</a>&nbsp;posted this week about how this kind of behaviour seemed to be worse than ever since the patch. In a comment thread there, someone who commented that "games are meant to be fun" also received the reply: "It\'s a season objective. <b>Literally not meant to be fun.</b> Just a way to progress."</p><p>I just kept thinking to myself: What are we doing here? Why are we optimising content for people who don\'t like it? And I realised that I\'m worried about SWTOR flashpoints going down the way of World of Warcraft dungeons.</p><p>WoW was my first MMO as well as my introduction to doing group content with random players, and I <i>loved</i> it. The first time I did the Deadmines? Amazing. I got yelled at for ninja-looting a chest because I didn\'t know any better, but I apologised, learned from it and we moved on. For about three or four years, dungeons were easily one of my favourite things to do in the game. However, somewhere along the line, things changed. Blizzard wanted players to run dungeons in greater numbers and more often, so they became increasingly incentivised for endless replay, and people\'s attitudes changed accordingly.</p><p>I still play WoW almost twenty years later, but I rarely do dungeons in its modern incarnation now. Every now and then some reward will lure me into queueing up for a pug dungeon again, just for me to instantly be reminded of why I no longer find them fun. Everything is just an insane rush to the end to pick up the reward and it\'s a casual or new player\'s absolute nightmare.</p><p>When I started playing SWTOR, I instantly fell in love with the game\'s flashpoints too. The Esseles and Black Talon are absolutely amazing experiences that have no real equivalent in other games when you play through them in a group for the first time and as intended (which is to say, actually paying attention to the story and listening to the group conversations). They are also clearly not intended to be re-run on a daily basis. Sure, they can be fun to re-play every now and then, to see what different conversation choices do and so on, but it\'s clearly not something you\'re supposed to do <i>all the time</i>. The game won\'t stop you from running it multiple times a day if you want to, but I think it\'s fair to say that you were effectively "doing it wrong" in that case and couldn\'t really complain if it wasn\'t super fun. The idea with SWTOR flashpoints was that they were still meant to be a bit of an adventure every time you entered one, something you can only really consume in moderation.</p><p>With this change... I don\'t really know anymore. I can even defend the removal of cut scenes as a temporary measure for the Galactic Season, mostly because it benefits me personally, but people like me, who do Galactic Seasons on every server, can hardly make up a significant chunk of the player base. Clearly the intent is to get more players into flashpoints that haven\'t done them before, but I\'m not sure this whole exercise is going to show them anything appealing enough to want to come back. Endless running along corridors with no rhyme or reason about what is going on? What\'s appealing about that?</p><p>I also saw someone comment somewhere that Final Fantasy XIV used to have a similar problem with new players having a bad experience in the group finder due to issues with cut scene skipping, and Square Enix\'s solution to that was to make the cut scenes unskippable for <i>everyone</i> and increase the reward payout to make sure veterans were being suitably compensated for the fact that the run was taking longer to accommodate the newbies. Now, I don\'t play FFXIV myself, so I can\'t tell you how well that worked out for everyone, but I think it shows that "whelp, we\'ve got to cater to the people who are in a hurry" is not an inevitability. SWTOR and FF have a lot in common in terms of their focus on story, so it\'s actually kind of odd to me now to see the SWTOR devs choose speed-running over story in this instance.</p><p>At this point, after thinking about it some more, I feel like instead of removing cut scenes all over the place they should\'ve gone back and reconsidered what flashpoints are all about and why people are funnelled into them the way they are. Why do people ask to skip cut scenes? Because they\'re in a flashpoint they don\'t really want to be in. Why are they in this flashpoint? Because we give extra rewards for queueing for a random flashpoint. Why do we give rewards for that? So people who want to run specific flashpoints can get groups for them. But why would people run the Esseles in a group these days when there is a solo mode available anyway? Maybe the devs should\'ve just taken it out of the group finder like they did Kuat and Colicoid War Games. Leaving it in but taking out everything that actually made it unique and insteresting just feels like extremely muddled game design to me. It just doesn\'t make sense in my head.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>I\'ve been having fun with the new season so far and will probably talk about that at some point, but the <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/a-farewell-to-pug-cut-scenes.html">removal of cut scenes and group conversations from the group finder</a> continues to weigh heavily on my mind.

I got the impression that at least one of them got a bit flustered by that and tried to overcompensate by mounting up and rushing ahead even of the level 80 at one point, just to then be told off because not everyone had made it up the elevator yet when we were put into combat as a result of that (which was technically correct but also must\'ve been confusing in terms of mixed messages).</p><p>I got really annoyed with that level 80\'s attitude but didn\'t say anything because frankly I was quite busy just keeping up with their constant running myself, as well as just keeping everyone else alive. I simply did what I could to support the lowbies, such as when one of them veered off towards the bonus boss while the 80 was just trying to go straight to the end. I just kept hoping that neither of the little guys were genuinely new players because if I had been a newbie in that situation, I would have been <i>so</i> put off from running flashpoints ever again.</p><p>Now, to be clear, all of this technically has nothing to do with the cut scene change, because people could act like that while the group conversations were still a thing. However, at least the cut scenes would put the brakes on things a little bit. They were a reminder that this flashpoint wasn\'t <i>designed</i> to be rushed like that. And I feel that the removal of the cut scenes does the opposite now, vindicating people like that level 80 in the sense that yes, the devs agree with you that flashpoints are something to get over and done with as quickly as possible. I feel like my opinion was validated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1mvj1j5/group_finder_flashpoint_skippers_are_insatiable/">a thread on the SWTOR subreddit</a>&nbsp;posted this week about how this kind of behaviour seemed to be worse than ever since the patch. In a comment thread there, someone who commented that "games are meant to be fun" also received the reply: "It\'s a season objective. <b>Literally not meant to be fun.</b> Just a way to progress."</p><p>I just kept thinking to myself: What are we doing here? Why are we optimising content for people who don\'t like it? And I realised that I\'m worried about SWTOR flashpoints going down the way of World of Warcraft dungeons.</p><p>WoW was my first MMO as well as my introduction to doing group content with random players, and I <i>loved</i> it. The first time I did the Deadmines? Amazing. I got yelled at for ninja-looting a chest because I didn\'t know any better, but I apologised, learned from it and we moved on. For about three or four years, dungeons were easily one of my favourite things to do in the game. However, somewhere along the line, things changed. Blizzard wanted players to run dungeons in greater numbers and more often, so they became increasingly incentivised for endless replay, and people\'s attitudes changed accordingly.</p><p>I still play WoW almost twenty years later, but I rarely do dungeons in its modern incarnation now. Every now and then some reward will lure me into queueing up for a pug dungeon again, just for me to instantly be reminded of why I no longer find them fun. Everything is just an insane rush to the end to pick up the reward and it\'s a casual or new player\'s absolute nightmare.</p><p>When I started playing SWTOR, I instantly fell in love with the game\'s flashpoints too. The Esseles and Black Talon are absolutely amazing experiences that have no real equivalent in other games when you play through them in a group for the first time and as intended (which is to say, actually paying attention to the story and listening to the group conversations). They are also clearly not intended to be re-run on a daily basis. Sure, they can be fun to re-play every now and then, to see what different conversation choices do and so on, but it\'s clearly not something you\'re supposed to do <i>all the time</i>. The game won\'t stop you from running it multiple times a day if you want to, but I think it\'s fair to say that you were effectively "doing it wrong" in that case and couldn\'t really complain if it wasn\'t super fun. The idea with SWTOR flashpoints was that they were still meant to be a bit of an adventure every time you entered one, something you can only really consume in moderation.</p><p>With this change... I don\'t really know anymore. I can even defend the removal of cut scenes as a temporary measure for the Galactic Season, mostly because it benefits me personally, but people like me, who do Galactic Seasons on every server, can hardly make up a significant chunk of the player base. Clearly the intent is to get more players into flashpoints that haven\'t done them before, but I\'m not sure this whole exercise is going to show them anything appealing enough to want to come back. Endless running along corridors with no rhyme or reason about what is going on? What\'s appealing about that?</p><p>I also saw someone comment somewhere that Final Fantasy XIV used to have a similar problem with new players having a bad experience in the group finder due to issues with cut scene skipping, and Square Enix\'s solution to that was to make the cut scenes unskippable for <i>everyone</i> and increase the reward payout to make sure veterans were being suitably compensated for the fact that the run was taking longer to accommodate the newbies. Now, I don\'t play FFXIV myself, so I can\'t tell you how well that worked out for everyone, but I think it shows that "whelp, we\'ve got to cater to the people who are in a hurry" is not an inevitability. SWTOR and FF have a lot in common in terms of their focus on story, so it\'s actually kind of odd to me now to see the SWTOR devs choose speed-running over story in this instance.</p><p>At this point, after thinking about it some more, I feel like instead of removing cut scenes all over the place they should\'ve gone back and reconsidered what flashpoints are all about and why people are funnelled into them the way they are. Why do people ask to skip cut scenes? Because they\'re in a flashpoint they don\'t really want to be in. Why are they in this flashpoint? Because we give extra rewards for queueing for a random flashpoint. Why do we give rewards for that? So people who want to run specific flashpoints can get groups for them. But why would people run the Esseles in a group these days when there is a solo mode available anyway? Maybe the devs should\'ve just taken it out of the group finder like they did Kuat and Colicoid War Games. Leaving it in but taking out everything that actually made it unique and insteresting just feels like extremely muddled game design to me. It just doesn\'t make sense in my head.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/flashpoints-why-are-we-here.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/flashpoints-why-are-we-here.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimdkGSdQiSS4eey0f_KQQR3sjZQc7opi2V6jnxakFbjNK6yJWa4tyEMsIlbA8XLuRqKFsYTtTQQEII7EpkfSR4E80GwU22CJrs5g_dFowEL44LXMuXxjBgkejuhPPZdutfZ0C3suWotuun1gT8_nTZetUXg6BBwFj1ckgC-RR4XL0MNhrLFRKho5AbC2Q/s72-c/Rushy%20player%20in%20the%20Esseles.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '3'}

I loved it when I found my people! And when someone disagreed about what the "right" choice was in a certain scenario, there was usually some friendly banter to be had. No more.</p><p></p><p>(Just as a disclaimer so nobody gets the wrong idea: I didn\'t "force" any of these pugs to wait for me while I was watching cut scenes.

You can actually get <i>most</i> of the way towards your personal Conquest target by doing that every day, assuming that you\'ll also have a companion go up an influence level at least once or twice in the process.</p><p>It\'s felt kind of satisfying, but also made me realise just how slow of a process it is if you\'re just sitting there waiting for your companions to run missions or craft things, especially if your character isn\'t that progressed and therefore doesn\'t have that many companions yet and they aren\'t of particularly high influence. I haven\'t really felt the weight of that in a long time, considering how long most of my characters on Darth Malgus have been maxed out in everything.</p><p>Sadly my efforts haven\'t made much of a dent in the pile of mission discoveries yet since a lot of them require pretty high skills to use, but at least I\'m making <i>some</i> progress.

Like I said back then, other people feel motivated to play in order to earn free items; I feel driven to play in order to deal with all the free items that are being thrust upon me!</p><p>I also realised that with each character having three crew skills that cap out at 700 points each, raising them at a rate of one skill-up per day to maximise Conquest points would take almost six years per character. There really was no need for me to artificially try and slow things down.</p><p>So I\'ve been logging into at least one character per server per day over the past few weeks to level up their crew skills. You can actually get <i>most</i> of the way towards your personal Conquest target by doing that every day, assuming that you\'ll also have a companion go up an influence level at least once or twice in the process.</p><p>It\'s felt kind of satisfying, but also made me realise just how slow of a process it is if you\'re just sitting there waiting for your companions to run missions or craft things, especially if your character isn\'t that progressed and therefore doesn\'t have that many companions yet and they aren\'t of particularly high influence. I haven\'t really felt the weight of that in a long time, considering how long most of my characters on Darth Malgus have been maxed out in everything.</p><p>Sadly my efforts haven\'t made much of a dent in the pile of mission discoveries yet since a lot of them require pretty high skills to use, but at least I\'m making <i>some</i> progress. I think my main takeaway from the whole exercise is that next season I\'ll need to remember to run at least a couple of crew skills on the side during each "proper" play session to make sure I can get them levelled up more consistently.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/skilling-those-crews.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/skilling-those-crews.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'thr_total': '1'}

Dromund Kaas</b></p><p>If you split the seven planets that had dynamic encounters added in 7.7 into three groups - capital worlds, starter planets and Ilum - I think both of the capital worlds definitely came out on top. With more than twenty unique encounters per planet they offer the most variety of the bunch, as well as offering an easy way to grind Conquest points.</p><p>The encounters on Dromund Kaas are thematically very varied, mostly leaning into the different regional "themes" previously established in side missions, such as the spaceport being somewhat in disarray or the lightning spires being under attack. They mostly seem to be set in the same time period as those original exploration missions, though I noticed while dispersing unruly Imperial citizens in Kaas City that one of them yelled "What is Xarion hiding?", which I thought was an interesting detail that would place that one after Onslaught in the timeline.</p><p>In general, most of the encounters are quick and fun, and strategically placed in locations where people are bound to come through on their way to some other mission objective, making it very temping to allow yourself to be distracted for a moment to complete an encounter. Prime examples of this are doing "Bad Monkey" just after arriving at the spaceport, or hunting down the rogue bounty hunter while passing through Kaas City.</p><p>If I had to cite anything negative, I\'d say that there are a <i>couple</i> of encounters with flaws. The Apex Predator in "Shock and Awe" feels way overtuned for levelling players (trying to solo it on a level thirty-something with a healer companion I was chunked to death within only a couple of hits), and the final boss for "Kubaz Incursion" can be a bit annoyingly hard to find. "Powder Keg" actually being possible to fail is a neat idea but the fact that it\'s the only encounter of this kind and that it\'s not obvious at all what is going on unless you\'re already in the know makes it a bit unpleasant in that regard.</p><p>Also, I wish they\'d fix encounter voice lines sometimes playing when the encounter isn\'t even up, because every time my speeder rides past the lightning spires I get spammed with yells about multiple encounters that may not actually all be active.</p><p>Anyway, all in all it\'s still a fun romp, and the reason it\'s edging out Coruscant for first place in my opinion is that the map makes it both cheap and easy to get around if you want to do multiple encounters. Which brings us to...</p><p><b>2. Coruscant&nbsp;</b></p><p>In general, Coruscant is one of <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/03/all-swtor-planets-ranked-from-best-to.html">my top three planets in the entire game</a>, and most positive things I said about the dynamic encounters on Dromund Kaas above also apply to Coruscant. The reason I put it in second place is simply the fact that it\'s a bit of a pain to travel between dynamic encounters due to the planetary layout with the different sectors, which all count as being really far apart, which in turn means that moving between them always requires either a looong taxi ride or paying the maximum price for quick travel. Even if you do opt for quick travel though, the sectors are still laid out in such a way that it can be a pain to just travel from one dynamic encounter within the same sector to the next one.</p><p>The said, I adore most of the encounters in the Senate Plaza, which is where I\'m always passing through when I exit my stronghold, and I basically never pass on an opportunity to set off some fireworks or to help clean up the party\'s aftermath.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/s1920/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Fireworks going off at the Senate Plaza on Coruscant" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/w400-h225/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Negatives are that some of the Black Sun and Justicar encounters don\'t have nearly enough clickies if there\'s even more than one person trying to do the encounter at the same time, the way Ugnaught Engineering was horrifically bugged when it first came out and made people get into fights about who was supposedly <i>causing</i> it to bug, stealing kills or whatever (regardless of whether it was true or not), and the one encounter on the Senate Plaza that I don\'t like, "Understaffed".

Tython&nbsp;</b></p><p>Next we have the starter planets, which I think are all pretty similar in quality, and I don\'t feel particularly strongly about the order in which I\'ve ranked them against each other. The main reason I consider them worse than the capital planets it that there are very few encounters, so you\'ll run out of things to do pretty quickly if you\'re just trying to grind on a single planet, and that none of the DEs on the starter planets give Conquest points. I can see why the devs decided to have that limitation, but it still means that for someone who\'s very Conquest-focused like me, they tend to have a lot less replay value.</p><p>With that general preamble out of the way, Tython is definitely my favourite of the bunch, since it\'s my favourite of all the starter planets and I think all its dynamic encounters are very on point, whether you\'re doing simple chores at the Jedi Temple or beating back the flesh raiders.</p><p>The only thing I\'ll say is that I do wonder a little how having a dynamic encounter pop up the moment you leave your intro phase is going to affect new players\' perception of the planet and the game as a whole, and whether it might make things come off as a bit "loud" and overwhelming to less experienced gamers. I would love to have insight into the devs\' behavioural metrics on the starter planets for that one...&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>4. Hutta</b></p><p>Hutta is actually one of my least favourite planets, generally speaking, but I think in terms of dynamic encounters it works well enough. Again, the themes of the encounters go very well with what\'s also conveyed via the existing side missions, from dangerous wildlife to rebellious evocii.</p><p>The only thing I\'m not so sure about is having an encounter that is basically a vehicle quest right outside the spawn phase, because it makes me wonder whether that isn\'t a bit confusing/overwhelming for new players. Even if seeing a bunch of droids enter the gang wars right outside the Poison Pit <i>does</i> serve to drive home the point that the town is a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/s1920/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A walker on Ord Mantell surrounded by dozens of loot beams" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/w400-h225/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>5. Ord Mantell</b><p></p><p>Ord Mantell is one of two planets where I actually feel like some of the encounters are <i>slightly</i> off in tone. This may very well be my personal bias speaking, as someone who mains a trooper and was instantly scarred by being blamed for the death of Bellis the informant at the hands of the separatists by multiple people, but I always perceived the whole setting with the separatists as very dark and desperate. Even the smuggler story with all its goofiness has a pretty dark turn here with Corso\'s parents being dead because of the separatists and him having that one moment where he wants to execute that random sep in cold blood.</p><p>With that said, I just feel like some of the encounters involving separatists feel a bit too silly. Like that mad scientist type sending you out to shoot separatists with one of his droids? It\'s one thing if there\'s a specific NPC that\'s bit ridiculous when you talk to them, that\'s clearly just that one character, but the fact that you hear the dynamic encounter yells repeated endlessly even when you\'re just driving by gives them a much stronger impact on the mood in my opinion. Might just be me.</p><p><b>6. Korriban</b></p><p>That\'s also the reason why I rate Korriban last of this batch, because again, several of the encounters just feel a <i>bit</i> too goofy to me personally. Don\'t get me wrong, both the Sith warrior and inquisitor stories have plenty of humorous moments even on Korriban, but I still always got the vibe that as a <i>setting</i>, the planet is clearly meant to be very grim, with all the racial purity nonsense and dog-eat-dog behaviour encouraged in the acolytes. Stuff like k\'lor\'slugs running wild around the academy feels more like the kind of hijinx you\'d find in a young adult book series about a magic school. (That said, looking at how busy each planet is, this one actually seems to be very popular with people, so again, this might just be me.)</p><p><b>7. Ilum&nbsp;</b></p><p>Finally, in last place - alas, poor Ilum. I really wanted the addition of dynamic encounters to this planet to feel like a revival for it. I have some fond memories of Ilum from the game\'s early days, even though it felt somewhat unfinished even then, but over time it\'s only ever declined in relevance. Sadly I can\'t say that I feel like dynamic encounters have put it back on people\'s radar, and based on the small number of other people I see doing encounters there, I get the impression that it didn\'t really land for the majority of the population either.</p><p>Good things first: the theming is once again spot-on on this one. They really leaned into the Republic vs. Empire conflict from the original storyline and even added some encounter achievements that are meant to encourage world PvP. (I\'m 99% sure that almost nobody will bother with those, but I appreciate the effort.) On the Western Ice Shelf, they\'ve expanded on the lore of the Tonvarr Pirates that were previously only really relevant during the Gree event. It all works.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/s1920/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Sith Pureblood, surrounded by pets and companions, sits on the stone throne inside Fort Tonvarr" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/w400-h225/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The problem is simply that too many of the encounters are just not very fun. Too many of them have multiple stages and feature a large number of mobs - when sometimes mob-killing isn\'t even part of the main objective, which makes it feel like you\'re just endlessly wading back and forth through constantly respawning mobs to actually get to the next clicky you need. It just feels tedious to the point that my brain keeps trying to forget that Ilum is another planet that has dynamic encounters now and I very rarely even remember to go there.</p><p>All that said, I wanted to also give a shout-out to a change to dynamic encounters in general that came with 7.7 but that I didn\'t see in the patch notes: When they released these new encounters, they changed it so that on staged DEs, you no longer need to complete every single stage by yourself to get credit, but rather you can join in at any time and still get completion. I feel that this has been a great change and has been most noticeable for me during encounters such as the base attacks on Tatooine and Hoth. It used to be that I felt that there was no point in joining in if people were already fighting the stage two walker, as it wouldn\'t give me anything and I\'d just have to restart the encounter from scratch afterwards anyway. Now I\'ll gleefully jump in and help out because I\'ll actually be rewarded for it too, which I think has been a great change.</p><p>How many of the new encounters have you done at this point? And do you agree with my ranking of the planets or not?

Even if seeing a bunch of droids enter the gang wars right outside the Poison Pit <i>does</i> serve to drive home the point that the town is a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/s1920/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A walker on Ord Mantell surrounded by dozens of loot beams" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/w400-h225/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>5. Ord Mantell</b><p></p><p>Ord Mantell is one of two planets where I actually feel like some of the encounters are <i>slightly</i> off in tone. This may very well be my personal bias speaking, as someone who mains a trooper and was instantly scarred by being blamed for the death of Bellis the informant at the hands of the separatists by multiple people, but I always perceived the whole setting with the separatists as very dark and desperate. Even the smuggler story with all its goofiness has a pretty dark turn here with Corso\'s parents being dead because of the separatists and him having that one moment where he wants to execute that random sep in cold blood.</p><p>With that said, I just feel like some of the encounters involving separatists feel a bit too silly. Like that mad scientist type sending you out to shoot separatists with one of his droids? It\'s one thing if there\'s a specific NPC that\'s bit ridiculous when you talk to them, that\'s clearly just that one character, but the fact that you hear the dynamic encounter yells repeated endlessly even when you\'re just driving by gives them a much stronger impact on the mood in my opinion. Might just be me.</p><p><b>6. Korriban</b></p><p>That\'s also the reason why I rate Korriban last of this batch, because again, several of the encounters just feel a <i>bit</i> too goofy to me personally. Don\'t get me wrong, both the Sith warrior and inquisitor stories have plenty of humorous moments even on Korriban, but I still always got the vibe that as a <i>setting</i>, the planet is clearly meant to be very grim, with all the racial purity nonsense and dog-eat-dog behaviour encouraged in the acolytes. Stuff like k\'lor\'slugs running wild around the academy feels more like the kind of hijinx you\'d find in a young adult book series about a magic school. (That said, looking at how busy each planet is, this one actually seems to be very popular with people, so again, this might just be me.)</p><p><b>7. Ilum&nbsp;</b></p><p>Finally, in last place - alas, poor Ilum. I really wanted the addition of dynamic encounters to this planet to feel like a revival for it. I have some fond memories of Ilum from the game\'s early days, even though it felt somewhat unfinished even then, but over time it\'s only ever declined in relevance. Sadly I can\'t say that I feel like dynamic encounters have put it back on people\'s radar, and based on the small number of other people I see doing encounters there, I get the impression that it didn\'t really land for the majority of the population either.</p><p>Good things first: the theming is once again spot-on on this one. They really leaned into the Republic vs. Empire conflict from the original storyline and even added some encounter achievements that are meant to encourage world PvP. (I\'m 99% sure that almost nobody will bother with those, but I appreciate the effort.) On the Western Ice Shelf, they\'ve expanded on the lore of the Tonvarr Pirates that were previously only really relevant during the Gree event. It all works.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/s1920/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Sith Pureblood, surrounded by pets and companions, sits on the stone throne inside Fort Tonvarr" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/w400-h225/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The problem is simply that too many of the encounters are just not very fun. Too many of them have multiple stages and feature a large number of mobs - when sometimes mob-killing isn\'t even part of the main objective, which makes it feel like you\'re just endlessly wading back and forth through constantly respawning mobs to actually get to the next clicky you need. It just feels tedious to the point that my brain keeps trying to forget that Ilum is another planet that has dynamic encounters now and I very rarely even remember to go there.</p><p>All that said, I wanted to also give a shout-out to a change to dynamic encounters in general that came with 7.7 but that I didn\'t see in the patch notes: When they released these new encounters, they changed it so that on staged DEs, you no longer need to complete every single stage by yourself to get credit, but rather you can join in at any time and still get completion. I feel that this has been a great change and has been most noticeable for me during encounters such as the base attacks on Tatooine and Hoth. It used to be that I felt that there was no point in joining in if people were already fighting the stage two walker, as it wouldn\'t give me anything and I\'d just have to restart the encounter from scratch afterwards anyway. Now I\'ll gleefully jump in and help out because I\'ll actually be rewarded for it too, which I think has been a great change.</p><p>How many of the new encounters have you done at this point? And do you agree with my ranking of the planets or not? Let me know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/ranking-77-dynamic-encounter-planets.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/ranking-77-dynamic-encounter-planets.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/s72-w400-h225-c/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

I <i>did</i> get both of those things, but as I always do, I have some nits to pick as well.</p><p><b>Story is coming... but later and perhaps less than we\'d hoped</b></p><p>At least when talking with some of my friends, there had been a hope expressed that the next story patch would be one big "catch-up patch" giving us a bigger chunk of story than usual, kind of like how Echoes of Oblivion and Spirit of Vengeance (which were originally supposed to be separate pieces of content) were both released at the same time after delays caused by Covid.</p><p>This... is not going to be the case. 7.8, which will come out before Christmas, will have the "Galactic Threads" story that was originally meant to be included in patch 7.6 last Christmas, and then they\'ll speed up a little bit and add "Master\'s Engima", the story originally built for patch 7.7, with 7.8.1, which should then launch at some point early next year and would usually have included only the start of Galactic Season 10 and no story update.</p><p>While I\'m glad to finally have something close to a date, having to wait another four months or so until the next story drop still hurts - by that point the game will have gone nearly 18 months without a story patch, which is unprecedented in this MMO\'s history.</p><p>The other thing that stuck out to me is that if we\'re getting the story that was meant to be in 7.6 in 7.8, what was meant to be in 7.8 before that? No story? Ultimately it feels like aside from the delays, we also <i>lost</i> one of the twice-a-year story installments due to the strike, which sucks.</p><p>Same thing with date nights by the way - they mentioned working on one back in the 7.6.1 stream, but now we won\'t even get one with 7.7.1, with the next expected release (Torian and Kira) coming with 7.8.1 next year.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Galactic Season 9: Flashpoint Resurgence</b></p><p>As for GS9, its theme is flashpoints. Yippee! There will be Czerka buffs involved like there were for uprisings during GS8, which I don\'t really care about, but I\'m good with running flashpoints with or without buffs. Unfortunately it sounded like the objectives will be veteran mode only, which is a bit disappointing to me personally and will not encourage my guildies to group up I reckon, but still, it\'s flashpoints.</p><p>The most interesting bit of the stream to me personally was the devs talking about how they were using the occasion of this seasonal focus on flashpoints to make some changes to the activity finder. A big quality of life improvement they will make is that you\'ll finally be able to queue as multiple roles again, change roles while queueing (so that you can e.g. do dailies in a dps spec while queueing for a flashpoint as healer) and it will take both of your combat styles into account, meaning you could queue as all <i>three</i> roles if you wanted and have the right combat styles for it. Now, to be clear, only the last bit of that is actually new - both the ability to queue for multiple roles and the ability to queue as a different role than you\'re currently playing were in the game before but got patched out at some point, I think because they were buggy or causing issues of some sort. Still, I\'m very glad to see these features make a comeback at last.</p><p>They are also going to improve the loot you get in flashpoints while levelling, though it\'s not entirely clear what that will mean - I\'m guessing more gear that is actually appropriate for your level and combat style, because getting drops that you can\'t even use or not use for another twenty levels was definitely a thing sometimes.</p><p>For the max levels, you\'ll no longer have to queue for all flashpoints to be eligible for additional daily/weekly rewards, but can exclude a few that you may want to avoid. You still won\'t be rewarded for just spamming Hammer Station and nothing else, but you can untick a couple you don\'t like, which I guess is nice.&nbsp;</p><p><b>No more "spacebar plz"</b></p><p>The thing that kind of shocked me was that in connection to all these flashpoint changes, queued veteran and master mode flashpoints will no longer feature any cut scenes or group conversations; everything will just be auto-skipped and if there was some sort of decision to be made (such as whether to kill or spare the captain in the Black Talon) it will just do so automatically. If you want to see the conversations and cut scenes in the future, you\'ll need to do story mode (where available) or manually walk into the higher difficulty with some friends.</p><p>Now, I completely understand why they are doing this and I\'m sure many people will consider this a major quality of life improvement. I made a whole <a href="https://youtu.be/7Wy2EA4fZrQ?si=CP0QdGpEjH5tDKy6&amp;t=144">compilation poking fun at people\'s urge to skip the cut scenes</a> <i>seven years ago</i>. I\'ve seen it all, from the guy who drops group the moment you zone into the Esseles or Black Talon, to endless arguments about who isn\'t hitting their space bar and why. It was a source of friction for sure.</p><p>AND YET. I myself have always loved the group conversations in flashpoints and was generally happy to watch cut scenes if other people wanted to do so too. I enjoy running flashpoints, but I never "spammed" them to the point where getting the Esseles again made me frustrated. (The only flashpoint that I\'ve managed to get utterly sick of is Hammer Station, and that has nothing to do with cut scenes and everything to do with the community.)</p><p>I also felt that the group conversations often inspired fun little interactions, such as when a dark or light side choice got people chatting. My guildies have seen me express (not-entirely-serious) outrage at killing the engineers or leaving Asara behind in the Esseles more than a few times. And some of the cut scenes also just genuinely looked nice! I have a whole collection of screenshots of pugs in Czerka Corporate Labs, from that last cut scene that shows your group walking into the room looking heroic.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s1741/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Four SWTOR characters about to face down the last boss in Czerka Corporate Labs.

Telling me that you can <i>technically</i> build a group manually and walk in to still see the cut scenes is a bit of a cold comfort because let\'s be real, how often do people do that? How often have you run Kuat Drive Yards since it was removed from the group finder? I just feel like this is going to be one of those things that will end up having negative ripple effects that people won\'t fully feel until later down the line. Or maybe I\'m just a relic of ancient times for having actually enjoyed interacting with my pug mates in small ways, even if there was friction sometimes.</p><p><b>Be free, F2P-ers!</b></p><p>A big change for free-to-play players that\'s coming with the next patch is that the devs will be dropping a <i>lot</i> of the old restrictions on that type of account. You will now also get sprint at level 1,&nbsp;have all action bars unlocked,&nbsp;be able to hide your head slot&nbsp; and equip random purples that you get while levelling. Honestly, with some of the things they mentioned I didn\'t even know there were restrictions for that: What, F2P players couldn\'t display legacy titles before? Or equip companion customisations? WTF?</p><p>Even as someone who\'s always been subscribed, I think this is great news. SWTOR has had a reputation for having extremely draconian F2P restrictions for a long time - I remember how the limited action bars were a source of ridicule across the entire MMO community when the game first went free-to-play. I think the devs did the right thing by being cautious when they first changed payment model back in the day (mostly because other MMOs that followed suit later and kept crowing about how much more generous their F2P model was in comparison, such as Rift and Wildstar, did ultimately not end up doing well).</p><p>However, all of that was over a decade ago, times have changed, and there\'s just no reason to be quite so brutal with all those restrictions on what\'s effectively the game\'s free trial mode. Annoying players with arbitrary feature locks before they\'ve even left the starter planet was just never great, and I hope that these changes will give more people a chance to actually fall in love with what the game has to offer and then spend some money on it happily instead of feeling nagged from the get-go.</p><p><b>What about subscribers though?</b></p><p>So as not to leave subscribers feeling unappreciated, the game will run a new "subscriber login event" from September to December where you\'ll earn a special currency if you log in at least four times a week, which you can then use to buy some goodies. I kinda raised my eyebrow a bit at one of those goodies supposedly being "endgame gear" but we\'ll see. I really don\'t need more free stuff myself, but I can\'t blame them for trying to offer subscribers a bit more carrot while easing up on the F2P stick.</p><p><b>Say farewell to endless free CC</b></p><p>Speaking of carrots and sticks, regardless of your subscription status, you\'ve long gained 100 free Cartel Coins per month if you\'ve got a security key attached to your account. I often saw delighted comments from people who came back to the game after some time away to find that they\'d accumulated thousands of free Cartel Coins while not playing. While that was nice, considering for how long the game has been running at this point, I can\'t blame the bean counters for concluding that someone coming back after years and immediately finding $40 worth of Cartel Coins in their account was maybe not so good for their bottom line. No, that free CC is not going to go away, but it will only be awarded going forward if your account was actually active in the last 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Decos, Graphics, DirectX</b></p><p>Under "other topics about which I don\'t have that much to say", we have the Feast of Prosperity returning this autumn with some awesome new decos that I\'ll definitely want to grind for. (I actually broke my habit of ignoring Twitch chat to type "LOVE LAMP" when they showed the new ceiling lights.)&nbsp;</p><p>The character customisation updates continue, with Rattataki getting updated textures next, and dark-side corruption getting a much-needed revamp so that it no longer turns every character into a pasty white dude regardless of their previous skin colour. (I might actually give showing it on my dark-siders a try once this goes live - I previously always disabled it precisely because it changed your skin colour <i>so</i> much and I didn\'t want to look like an albino axolotl.) Also, after they added all those skin colours for aliens in the last patch, they are expanding on this by adding more hair and montral colours with 7.7.1.</p><p>Finally, in technical news that I have to file under "I don\'t know enough about this to have an opinion but I guess it sounds good", they are making good progress on updating the game to DirectX 12 but there\'s still some work left to do.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, if you want ALL THE DEETS, including things I didn\'t mention here and images of various rewards, here are some other places you can look:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0E_bwCPnoM">VOD on YouTube</a> (Twitch had some hiccups and split it into several parts)&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/%5Bnews-category%5D/20250730">Official recap article</a></li><li><a href="https://swtorista.com/articles/what-to-expect-in-update-7-7-1-in-swtor-august-2025/">Swtorista</a></li><li><a href="https://todayintor.com/2025/06/28/swtor-7-7-1-update-news/">Today in TOR</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>I was somewhat disappointed by the <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/02/a-season-of-uprisings-and.html">last two</a> <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/05/77-dev-stream-more-alien-colours-are.html">dev streams</a>, but the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-sag-aftra-members-approve-2025-interactive-media-agreement">voice actors\' strike ended a few weeks ago</a>, so I was positive that we\'d get some good news about the next story update this time, and I was also hopeful that whatever they were going to announce about Galactic Season 9 was going to be more appealing to me than Season 8\'s uprising focus had been.

I made a whole <a href="https://youtu.be/7Wy2EA4fZrQ?si=CP0QdGpEjH5tDKy6&amp;t=144">compilation poking fun at people\'s urge to skip the cut scenes</a> <i>seven years ago</i>. I\'ve seen it all, from the guy who drops group the moment you zone into the Esseles or Black Talon, to endless arguments about who isn\'t hitting their space bar and why. It was a source of friction for sure.</p><p>AND YET. I myself have always loved the group conversations in flashpoints and was generally happy to watch cut scenes if other people wanted to do so too. I enjoy running flashpoints, but I never "spammed" them to the point where getting the Esseles again made me frustrated. (The only flashpoint that I\'ve managed to get utterly sick of is Hammer Station, and that has nothing to do with cut scenes and everything to do with the community.)</p><p>I also felt that the group conversations often inspired fun little interactions, such as when a dark or light side choice got people chatting. My guildies have seen me express (not-entirely-serious) outrage at killing the engineers or leaving Asara behind in the Esseles more than a few times. And some of the cut scenes also just genuinely looked nice! I have a whole collection of screenshots of pugs in Czerka Corporate Labs, from that last cut scene that shows your group walking into the room looking heroic.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s1741/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Four SWTOR characters about to face down the last boss in Czerka Corporate Labs.

Telling me that you can <i>technically</i> build a group manually and walk in to still see the cut scenes is a bit of a cold comfort because let\'s be real, how often do people do that? How often have you run Kuat Drive Yards since it was removed from the group finder? I just feel like this is going to be one of those things that will end up having negative ripple effects that people won\'t fully feel until later down the line. Or maybe I\'m just a relic of ancient times for having actually enjoyed interacting with my pug mates in small ways, even if there was friction sometimes.</p><p><b>Be free, F2P-ers!</b></p><p>A big change for free-to-play players that\'s coming with the next patch is that the devs will be dropping a <i>lot</i> of the old restrictions on that type of account. You will now also get sprint at level 1,&nbsp;have all action bars unlocked,&nbsp;be able to hide your head slot&nbsp; and equip random purples that you get while levelling. Honestly, with some of the things they mentioned I didn\'t even know there were restrictions for that: What, F2P players couldn\'t display legacy titles before? Or equip companion customisations? WTF?</p><p>Even as someone who\'s always been subscribed, I think this is great news. SWTOR has had a reputation for having extremely draconian F2P restrictions for a long time - I remember how the limited action bars were a source of ridicule across the entire MMO community when the game first went free-to-play. I think the devs did the right thing by being cautious when they first changed payment model back in the day (mostly because other MMOs that followed suit later and kept crowing about how much more generous their F2P model was in comparison, such as Rift and Wildstar, did ultimately not end up doing well).</p><p>However, all of that was over a decade ago, times have changed, and there\'s just no reason to be quite so brutal with all those restrictions on what\'s effectively the game\'s free trial mode. Annoying players with arbitrary feature locks before they\'ve even left the starter planet was just never great, and I hope that these changes will give more people a chance to actually fall in love with what the game has to offer and then spend some money on it happily instead of feeling nagged from the get-go.</p><p><b>What about subscribers though?</b></p><p>So as not to leave subscribers feeling unappreciated, the game will run a new "subscriber login event" from September to December where you\'ll earn a special currency if you log in at least four times a week, which you can then use to buy some goodies. I kinda raised my eyebrow a bit at one of those goodies supposedly being "endgame gear" but we\'ll see. I really don\'t need more free stuff myself, but I can\'t blame them for trying to offer subscribers a bit more carrot while easing up on the F2P stick.</p><p><b>Say farewell to endless free CC</b></p><p>Speaking of carrots and sticks, regardless of your subscription status, you\'ve long gained 100 free Cartel Coins per month if you\'ve got a security key attached to your account. I often saw delighted comments from people who came back to the game after some time away to find that they\'d accumulated thousands of free Cartel Coins while not playing. While that was nice, considering for how long the game has been running at this point, I can\'t blame the bean counters for concluding that someone coming back after years and immediately finding $40 worth of Cartel Coins in their account was maybe not so good for their bottom line. No, that free CC is not going to go away, but it will only be awarded going forward if your account was actually active in the last 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Decos, Graphics, DirectX</b></p><p>Under "other topics about which I don\'t have that much to say", we have the Feast of Prosperity returning this autumn with some awesome new decos that I\'ll definitely want to grind for. (I actually broke my habit of ignoring Twitch chat to type "LOVE LAMP" when they showed the new ceiling lights.)&nbsp;</p><p>The character customisation updates continue, with Rattataki getting updated textures next, and dark-side corruption getting a much-needed revamp so that it no longer turns every character into a pasty white dude regardless of their previous skin colour. (I might actually give showing it on my dark-siders a try once this goes live - I previously always disabled it precisely because it changed your skin colour <i>so</i> much and I didn\'t want to look like an albino axolotl.) Also, after they added all those skin colours for aliens in the last patch, they are expanding on this by adding more hair and montral colours with 7.7.1.</p><p>Finally, in technical news that I have to file under "I don\'t know enough about this to have an opinion but I guess it sounds good", they are making good progress on updating the game to DirectX 12 but there\'s still some work left to do.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, if you want ALL THE DEETS, including things I didn\'t mention here and images of various rewards, here are some other places you can look:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0E_bwCPnoM">VOD on YouTube</a> (Twitch had some hiccups and split it into several parts)&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/%5Bnews-category%5D/20250730">Official recap article</a></li><li><a href="https://swtorista.com/articles/what-to-expect-in-update-7-7-1-in-swtor-august-2025/">Swtorista</a></li><li><a href="https://todayintor.com/2025/06/28/swtor-7-7-1-update-news/">Today in TOR</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/07/some-interesting-news-from-swtors-771.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/07/some-interesting-news-from-swtors-771.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s72-w400-h249-c/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '10'}

I didn\'t mention it in those posts at the time, but one guildie who ended up popping a particularly large number of tokens to help us achieve victory admitted that she had used a character transfer to shuttle in extra Requisitions from another server, where she\'d been collecting them from her login rewards on the side.</p><p>Now, for additional context, my guild successfully conquered every single available planet at some point over the last decade - with one notable exception: Belsavis.

I\'m not sure why that is, but I can only guess that Belsavis might not come up as often in the rotation as other planets. A planet like Tatooine for example is tied to the Death Mark Conquest event, which in turn is tied to Bounty Contract Week and comes around once a month.

We had a lot of Requisitions saved up, but not <i>that</i> many.</p><p>Anyway, last week\'s Total Galactic War arrived and the matter was brought up again. Looking at the scoreboard, all the biggest guilds had committed early for a change, and the guild in the lead on Belsavis was none other than our frenemies the Czech Empire. They were not a top five guild, and <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/04/at-token-war-with-czech-empire.html">we\'d beaten them before</a>... but it had also been the fight of a lifetime, and they were the reason we were so acutely aware of the power of Personal Conquest Requisitions in the first place, so there was no chance that we\'d be able to surprise them.</p><p>I quickly had a look at possible alternative invasion targets (that we had conquered in the past but that newer members would\'ve liked us to conquer again) but nothing stood out as an easy or obvious option, so after a bit of deliberation I decided to commit us to Belsavis. We agreed that we\'d hold off on using any tokens for now and that we\'d play it by ear, deciding our next steps later in the week depending on how it went.</p><p>Interestingly, it went quite differently than a year ago. Back then, we\'d overtaken the Czechs quickly, and they\'d been quite happy to trail us for the rest of the week with a steady ten million point gap between us. This time, they\'d clearly made a push on launch day to get a solid lead from the beginning, and they did not want us to catch them. We were about three million behind by the end of the first day and I figured that this was a difference we should be able to make up quickly enough, but <i>somehow</i> we couldn\'t quite get there. In fact, by Thursday morning the Czechs had grown their lead to seven million, and by evening we were <i>sixteen</i> million points behind them.</p><p>There was a time when being that far behind would\'ve been reason enough for us to fold, but I knew that the game wasn\'t quite over yet this time, as the other Conquest guy and I - <i>if</i> we went ahead with the server transfers - would have over 50 million points in tokens at our disposal. We did discuss amongst ourselves that if they kept gaining points at the same rate we\'d likely have to give up, but for the time being, we kept going.</p><p>Even though I knew that we had a plan, it was honestly a bit demotivating to keep grinding away when we were so far behind. I heard more than one defeatist comment from guildies but still did my best to counter the psychological warfare. I basically told everyone that we\'d let them know once the battle was lost, but as of now it wasn\'t over yet and they just had to trust me and keep going. (People knew about the saved up Conquest Requisitions, but I didn\'t tell anyone outside the leadership circle about the exact numbers since we\'re not very strict about removing people from our Discord for inactivity, and I was paranoid about information getting leaked to the competition somehow.)</p><p>And it seemed to work! While people weren\'t necessarily in the best of spirits, they kept at it. At its worst, the Czech\'s lead grew to around 18 million points, but they only maintained that for a brief while and most of the time the gap between us seemed to hover between ten and sixteen million.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/s1920/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot of a party fighting the last boss in the Landing Party uprising" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/w400-h225/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Then the weekend came and with it a sudden and unexpected burst of energy. (I think I\'m actually starting to notice a trend here, that my guild is better at Conquest in the second half of the week than in the first half.)</p><p>An officer that had been on hiatus for months popped his head in the door, asked how Total Galactic War was going and quickly ground out a half-million points in one evening. Another guild member who hasn\'t really been playing SWTOR in a while piped up to say that he had the week off and fancied randomly lending us a hand with grinding points. The funniest moment to me personally was when another guy who hadn\'t logged in in months showed up on Monday evening and we had a conversation that went something like this (paraphrased):</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Me: Look at you, logging in for the first time since the last Total Galactic War! [I could tell because on log-in he triggered the "Conqueror of Oricon" achievement.]</li><li>Him: Hah, you got me there. Would you like me to pop some tokens?</li><li>Me: How do you even have any? You haven\'t been online and you said you popped them all last time.</li><li>Him: Oops, I guess I lied.</li></ul><p>All of Sunday afternoon and evening the guild was absolutely buzzing with activity and achievements were popping left and right as people went out of their comfort zone and tried content they hadn\'t done before in order to earn Conquest points. Guild PvP was more active than it had been in months and there was plenty of banter. Point gains aside, it was a joy to see.</p><p>We could see that the Czechs were active in the evening and trying to bolster their score with some planetary rampaging, but we actually had a similar number of people online and were absolutely on fire. By the end of the evening, the gap between us was down to less than ten million.</p><p>I expected Monday to be more quiet, so I was both pleasantly surprised and had a good laugh when I decided to do a quick check-in on Monday morning and saw seven people online in guild. Clearly our members were less constrained by work than I\'d expected.</p><p>We continued Sunday\'s trend at a slightly slower pace and the gap between us and first place continued to shrink all day. By the time the last person went to bed we were only about a million points behind.</p><p>Tuesday I was working from home and I had put a bit of time aside around the end of Conquest to pop my Personal Conquest Requisitions as needed. I had transferred four characters to Darth Malgus the day before (my first character transfers ever) and now held 182 tokens in my inventory and cargo hold. Several other people were online and trying to earn some last-minute points while buzzing with excitement. We were pretty much neck on neck with the Czechs, but still always about a million behind.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/s1920/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot showing my character\'s inventory and an entire cargo bay filled with Personal Conquest Requisitions" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/w400-h225/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>With eight minutes to go on the timer, I decided to start clicking my Requisitions. I\'d told myself that I wasn\'t even going to look at the score, but was just going to keep popping the tokens. We didn\'t really care about overshooting and wasting points, as for us, this was the fight to end all fights. We wanted Belsavis and winning it was all that mattered.</p><p>While I wasn\'t looking at the board, other guildies were, and I was cracking up as several complained about their scoreboard going blank at some point. I\'d like to think that we were pumping so many points into the system that we temporarily overloaded it. Anyway, it turned out that apparently the Czechs did not have a counter to a big final push this time, so I saw guildies cry out "twelve million ahead", "twenty million", "thirty million", "they are not doing anything" and: "Are you still clicking, guys?"&nbsp;</p><p>I eventually stopped with about twenty tokens left in my inventory, though my fellow Conquest buddy used up every last one of his. It had been overkill indeed, as the final scoreboard showed us more than fifty million points ahead of the competition. But it was definitely worth it, as Twin Suns Squadron owned Belsavis at last, earning several of us the "Galaxy Conqueror" legacy title. I think I mentioned before that this isn\'t actually something that\'s hard to get if you simply join a large guild that wins a lot without even trying - it\'s how I got the title on the Shae Vizla server myself. But to have earned it in a smaller guild with hard work and communal effort, over the course of over a decade, that felt pretty good.</p><p>We wondered a bit why the Czechs folded as soon as we started our final offensive, and we can only guess that since the "surprise attack coming from behind" didn\'t work for them last time, they frontloaded more of their efforts (including token pops) this time in order to stay in first place from the beginning (and hopefully demotivate us). They probably didn\'t know that this exact strategy <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/12/living-degen-conquest-life.html">had failed Ace of Saints against us back in December</a> as well, but that\'s how it goes.</p><p>I almost want to say that I feel like I can retire from Conquest, now that I\'ve finally achieved it all, but I honestly enjoy it too much to just give up on it I think. However, any future planetary conquests for newer members admittedly won\'t quite carry the same weight or garner the same amount of excitement as this one did.&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>Last week it was once again time for Total Galactic War.

Point gains aside, it was a joy to see.</p><p>We could see that the Czechs were active in the evening and trying to bolster their score with some planetary rampaging, but we actually had a similar number of people online and were absolutely on fire. By the end of the evening, the gap between us was down to less than ten million.</p><p>I expected Monday to be more quiet, so I was both pleasantly surprised and had a good laugh when I decided to do a quick check-in on Monday morning and saw seven people online in guild. Clearly our members were less constrained by work than I\'d expected.</p><p>We continued Sunday\'s trend at a slightly slower pace and the gap between us and first place continued to shrink all day. By the time the last person went to bed we were only about a million points behind.</p><p>Tuesday I was working from home and I had put a bit of time aside around the end of Conquest to pop my Personal Conquest Requisitions as needed. I had transferred four characters to Darth Malgus the day before (my first character transfers ever) and now held 182 tokens in my inventory and cargo hold. Several other people were online and trying to earn some last-minute points while buzzing with excitement. We were pretty much neck on neck with the Czechs, but still always about a million behind.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/s1920/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot showing my character\'s inventory and an entire cargo bay filled with Personal Conquest Requisitions" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/w400-h225/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>With eight minutes to go on the timer, I decided to start clicking my Requisitions. I\'d told myself that I wasn\'t even going to look at the score, but was just going to keep popping the tokens. We didn\'t really care about overshooting and wasting points, as for us, this was the fight to end all fights. We wanted Belsavis and winning it was all that mattered.</p><p>While I wasn\'t looking at the board, other guildies were, and I was cracking up as several complained about their scoreboard going blank at some point. I\'d like to think that we were pumping so many points into the system that we temporarily overloaded it. Anyway, it turned out that apparently the Czechs did not have a counter to a big final push this time, so I saw guildies cry out "twelve million ahead", "twenty million", "thirty million", "they are not doing anything" and: "Are you still clicking, guys?"&nbsp;</p><p>I eventually stopped with about twenty tokens left in my inventory, though my fellow Conquest buddy used up every last one of his. It had been overkill indeed, as the final scoreboard showed us more than fifty million points ahead of the competition. But it was definitely worth it, as Twin Suns Squadron owned Belsavis at last, earning several of us the "Galaxy Conqueror" legacy title. I think I mentioned before that this isn\'t actually something that\'s hard to get if you simply join a large guild that wins a lot without even trying - it\'s how I got the title on the Shae Vizla server myself. But to have earned it in a smaller guild with hard work and communal effort, over the course of over a decade, that felt pretty good.</p><p>We wondered a bit why the Czechs folded as soon as we started our final offensive, and we can only guess that since the "surprise attack coming from behind" didn\'t work for them last time, they frontloaded more of their efforts (including token pops) this time in order to stay in first place from the beginning (and hopefully demotivate us). They probably didn\'t know that this exact strategy <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/12/living-degen-conquest-life.html">had failed Ace of Saints against us back in December</a> as well, but that\'s how it goes.</p><p>I almost want to say that I feel like I can retire from Conquest, now that I\'ve finally achieved it all, but I honestly enjoy it too much to just give up on it I think. However, any future planetary conquests for newer members admittedly won\'t quite carry the same weight or garner the same amount of excitement as this one did.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/06/conquest-of-parison-planet.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/06/conquest-of-parison-planet.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiynfkO8DKwSt-WV0hG4eCNCQHK67LN3Ciwtoh_E47mPQ0n_VffdqsaVZl_Vz8lh2fdaky2xqnWCnUA274GdLMzvzara6euEjX0vMSXG2poRELBn718-BblOF9zy1fTUKadZu0EaIxcDhIrueM9ZWualWypASkgD0GKjP8-2ZObDy0dB9Q4zPLZ_J-e3EY/s72-w400-h225-c/Shintar%20on%20Belsavis%20with%20Galaxy%20Conqueror%20legacy%20title.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '5'}

This makes sense in so far as they fill a similar niche and the DEs were the new hotness, but it also meant that what previously made this objective so much fun to do - that it was so varied in its locations and could be done in a number of different ways - was kind of lost as we were just stuck on either Tatooine or Hoth week after week.</p><p>We\'ll see how they\'ll handle this in future seasons, but I think my personal preference would be if they simply merged the two types of objectives together, into something like "Complete Dynamic Encounters, Repeatable, Exploration, or Bonus Missions while defeating enemies on Coruscant or Dromund Kaas", therefore restoring the "rotating between different planets" aspect while also including dynamic encounters in the mix.</p><p>Still, I\'ve got to admit I\'m going to try and temper my expectations for whenever they announce Galactic Season 9, because I\'m definitely a bit bored of the repetition and lack of even small bits of newness at this point.

I think most raiders would posit that for them, raiding is about some sort of progression: seeing the content, beating the challenge, getting the gear... and once you\'ve hit your goal, you move on.</p><p>SWTOR doesn\'t really support that kind of attitude towards raiding anymore, or at least not if you\'re a long-term player. If you\'re coming to the game completely fresh, there\'s plenty to do and many encounters to work your way through, thanks to scaling keeping all the old content relevant, but new operations come out way too infrequently to keep existing players busy for very long.</p><p>I sometimes find myself wondering why I\'m still so focused on that part of the game after more than a decade to be honest. I\'ve seen all there is to see, many times, and while my skill at the game has improved over the years from sheer repetition, if I haven\'t been able to beat a higher-difficulty encounter that\'s been in the game for over a decade at this point, I\'m not holding my breath that it\'s still going to happen.</p><p>I guess it\'s just a habit, a way of hanging out a few times a week, and the fact that Mr Commando and I do it together has led to a sort of feedback loop where we keep each other going even if one person\'s interest flags at some point.</p><p>That said, there\'s been turnover in the people we raid <i>with</i> over the years, and every now and then we\'ll get some fresh faces who haven\'t yet seen it all and who\'ll be excited to tackle this or that operation for the first time, and I\'ll be like "sure", because what else am I going to suggest?</p><p>In line with that we cleared Dread Palace master mode again a couple of months ago, and it actually went so quickly and smoothly (considering that some people had never done it before), that I found myself daring to hope for some personal progression for the first time in a while, because I\'d never gotten the achievement for the timed run, which requires you to clear the instance within an hour.</p><p>Everyone was game for working on it, so we kept going back every week, just to get better at the fights and progress that little bit more quickly, with fewer wipes along the way. Progression was far from smooth, as some nights would see us one-shot the first four bosses in a timely manner just to keep failing on the final Council fight, while on others, we would mess up repeatedly at the very beginning and then never even finish the instance.</p><p>However, improvement did happen, and this Wednesday we finally got there. We were actually off to a very bad start at first and wiped twice on the very first encounter.

I think most raiders would posit that for them, raiding is about some sort of progression: seeing the content, beating the challenge, getting the gear... and once you\'ve hit your goal, you move on.</p><p>SWTOR doesn\'t really support that kind of attitude towards raiding anymore, or at least not if you\'re a long-term player. If you\'re coming to the game completely fresh, there\'s plenty to do and many encounters to work your way through, thanks to scaling keeping all the old content relevant, but new operations come out way too infrequently to keep existing players busy for very long.</p><p>I sometimes find myself wondering why I\'m still so focused on that part of the game after more than a decade to be honest. I\'ve seen all there is to see, many times, and while my skill at the game has improved over the years from sheer repetition, if I haven\'t been able to beat a higher-difficulty encounter that\'s been in the game for over a decade at this point, I\'m not holding my breath that it\'s still going to happen.</p><p>I guess it\'s just a habit, a way of hanging out a few times a week, and the fact that Mr Commando and I do it together has led to a sort of feedback loop where we keep each other going even if one person\'s interest flags at some point.</p><p>That said, there\'s been turnover in the people we raid <i>with</i> over the years, and every now and then we\'ll get some fresh faces who haven\'t yet seen it all and who\'ll be excited to tackle this or that operation for the first time, and I\'ll be like "sure", because what else am I going to suggest?</p><p>In line with that we cleared Dread Palace master mode again a couple of months ago, and it actually went so quickly and smoothly (considering that some people had never done it before), that I found myself daring to hope for some personal progression for the first time in a while, because I\'d never gotten the achievement for the timed run, which requires you to clear the instance within an hour.</p><p>Everyone was game for working on it, so we kept going back every week, just to get better at the fights and progress that little bit more quickly, with fewer wipes along the way. Progression was far from smooth, as some nights would see us one-shot the first four bosses in a timely manner just to keep failing on the final Council fight, while on others, we would mess up repeatedly at the very beginning and then never even finish the instance.</p><p>However, improvement did happen, and this Wednesday we finally got there. We were actually off to a very bad start at first and wiped twice on the very first encounter.

There are always various things I want to do, each and every day &#8211; <em>want to</em> being the operative word here, not <em>have to</em>, which makes all the difference to me &#8211; and it still feels like I&#8217;m having a big adventure.</p>\n<p>By now I&#8217;m firmly settled in tier five, which means that I&#8217;ve pretty much explored the whole of Hagga Basin (with only a few bandit outposts missing here and there), fulfilled almost all contracts, and of course crafted a Scout Ornithopter as well as the much bigger Assault variant. I actually had to modify my base&#8217;s hangar quite a bit to make room for the latter, and it still just about fits in there.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8549" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8549 size-full" height="287" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky2.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8549">It dwarfs the buggy parked below, and that thing&#8217;s by no means small</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Just like the buggy before it, getting the first flying vehicle has changed how the game is played substantially. It obviously makes getting to places go much quicker, and even regions <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/23/every-day-on-arrakis-is-an-adventure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as jagged as Hagga Rift</a> have become pretty easy to traverse all of a sudden.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8550" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8550 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8550">No more getting lost down there, ha!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In most other games I&#8217;d probably have perceived this as a downside. In my opinion advanced means of travel often lead to the game world shrinking to the point of not feeling like a <em>world</em> at all anymore. On Arrakis it&#8217;s different somehow.</p>\n<p>First of all, it&#8217;s <em>extremely</em> fun! Turning off the engines and gliding in near silence over and across this beautiful landscapes is a feeling that screenshots can&#8217;t convey &#8211; it has to be experienced.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8551 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky4.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Another important aspect is that the game is very well designed in terms of progression.</p>\n<p>Just as I was realizing how big even the starting area is and how far apart the safe zones are, I got to build a sand bike. Next up the weight and volume of all kinds of stuff kept getting bigger, and harvesting the increasing amounts of required resources by hand got a bit tedious&#8230;buggy to the rescue!</p>\n<p>And now that I can fly everywhere? What do you know, the next tier of resources can only be found far out in the middle of nowhere &#8211; and &#8220;nowhere&#8221; is completely irradiated to boot, so getting in and out quickly is key.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8552" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8552 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8552">I&#8217;m NOT stepping into that sludge, hazmat suit or no!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In other words, everything happens or becomes available at just the right time, which I find pretty amazing.</p>\n<p>The devs took that into account when designing the various contracts, too. In the early game everything is relatively close by, and backtracking is rarely needed. By contrast, the other day I flew no less than four times to Harko Village and back to Hagga Basin because multiple quest lines I was working on required it. Without my own &#8216;thopter this would have been extremely inconvenient &#8211; and expensive, too &#8211; but as these were mid- to late-game contracts it is (correctly) assumed that zipping to and fro isn&#8217;t a problem anymore at that point.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8553" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8553 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky6.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8553">So they <strong>do</strong> have castles and such on Arrakis after all</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Speaking of quests, I&#8217;ve recently finished the first DLC-storyline, and I think it&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s divided into a continuation of the main story, which all players get for free, and a separate, paywalled questline.</p>\n<p>The latter&#8217;s overarching theme is &#8220;Bad AI&#8221;, or at the very least &#8220;Dangerous AI&#8221;, and not only does that fit well into the time we&#8217;re living in, it&#8217;s also a way for the devs to do something very different while not actually deviating from Dune lore.</p>\n<p>The screenshot above shows a game world designed by an AI for its coder and best (and only) friend. I think you can guess what kind of game it&#8217;s supposed to be. I especially appreciate the effort that went into changing even loot containers and such to fit the game&#8217;s aesthetics. It&#8217;s actually quite a sad story, but I liked it.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8554 size-full" height="299" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky7.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Another AI has developed more of a sinister personality, and its hiding place very much reflects that. It&#8217;s basically <em>Dead Space</em> on Arrakis. Really intense, that one!</p>\n<p>Recovering the third AI (which actually comes first when you play through it in order) wasn&#8217;t as memorable, but it&#8217;s still a cool introduction to the theme.</p>\n<p>Each of these quests culminates in a boss battle. Those aren&#8217;t particularly difficult, but I was glad to have <em>The Sentinel</em> equipped (as always), the little floating turret from the Mentat skill tree, because it helped immensely with keeping the swarms of AI-controlled opponents at bay.</p>\n<p>As of yet I haven&#8217;t even built the DLC-exclusive vehicle, the Treadwheel, nor have I used the Duneman building set, but I can highly recommend buying this piece of content for the storyline alone. It&#8217;s of the short variety for sure, but add in the other stuff and I think it&#8217;s well worth the 13 bucks.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8555" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8555 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8555">&#8220;Help me, Mailvaltar, you&#8217;re my only hope!&#8221; Or something.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The new main story quests are pretty cool, too. Among other things I&#8217;ve infiltrated the hideout of a Harkonnen cannibal (seriously), eliminated a cultist leader, and solved a full-blown murder mystery. Like most endeavours in this universe all of this turns out to be quite a bit more ambiguous than it seems at first. Very few things are strictly black or white.</p>\n<p>Also, we get to learn important details about our own origin, which I obviously won&#8217;t spoil here.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8556" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8556 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8556">Oh, look, it&#8217;s the Three Stooges</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I just realized that I&#8217;ve talked about combat encounters quite a lot by now, but I&#8217;ve yet to give my verdict of whether fighting in Dune: Awakening actually feels any good.</p>\n<p>Well&#8230;kinda.</p>\n<p>This <em>is</em> a game made by Funcom, and if you&#8217;ve played <em>The Secret World</em> you know what that means. It&#8217;s&#8230;janky, for lack of a better word. For example, it&#8217;s very easy to get stuck on the tiniest pieces of terrain, which can get you in big trouble when multiple enemies are trying to kill you at the same time.</p>\n<p>Also, you get staggered or stunned all the fricking time, and while that&#8217;s not due to said jankyness but a deliberate design decision (at least I assume that it is) that&#8217;s not really fun, and also <em>very</em> dangerous for obvious reasons.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8557" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8557 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8557">Gross&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Surprisingly though, I enjoy the combat quite a lot despite these shortcomings.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not really difficult in the usual sense of the word, but since it&#8217;s always a bit unpredictable it&#8217;s not exactly easy either. And, as I&#8217;ve talked about in the post linked at the top, there <em>is</em> a death penalty in place, so dying isn&#8217;t something that I want to happen often. Side note: I made a mistake in that post when I said that you drop only Solaris when you die in PvE &#8211; items you&#8217;ve looted like schematics, spice-infused dust etc. drop on death too, and you&#8217;ll usually want that stuff back. In short, there&#8217;s always a bit of tension, but not too much, which is just the way I like it.</p>\n<p>But who knows, maybe I&#8217;ve just grown fond of the Funcom-jankyness during my hundreds of hours playing The Secret World.

While I was building my first two bases in <em>Dune: Awakening</em> those limits already reared their ugly head, as I had a really hard time imagining how to mold all those different floors, walls, roofs, inclines and whathaveyou into anything other than a functional but ugly cube. I would not have made a good architect, that much is certain.</p>\n<p>I knew that I wanted my next and probably permanent main base to look at least somewhat nice though, so I started to look around and see what other players have done to get some inspiration.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, YouTube turned out to be the best place for that. What <em>did</em> surprise me was that some folks don&#8217;t just show off their great designs, they&#8217;ve even included step by step instructions to recreate them.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8517 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s what I did to get started. Many thanks to Arathy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@crimsonfelisbuilds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crimson Builds</a> for creating this base and taking the time to make that video!</p>\n<p>I still had to get a bit creative though, because, as you can see, the site I&#8217;d chosen to build the base at isn&#8217;t just flat land &#8211; what can I say, I <em>need</em> to have a room with a view &#8211; and the game doesn&#8217;t support terraforming. You <em>can</em> build in, around and even through concrete rock, but there are limits. Also, when there&#8217;s rock or sand inside your base you can&#8217;t place any facilities or furniture on top of it.</p>\n<p>To circumvent losing too much usable space on the ground floor I&#8217;d raised the foundations as much as possible at first &#8211; it seemed to be a good idea at the time. I didn&#8217;t place all of them right away though, as I needed to procure a lot more resources for the full build first. To protect the buggy and myself in the meantime I quickly erected some walls and a roof, and placed some generators, water cisterns and storage containers to collect and refine the building materials on site.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8518 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion3.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Once preparations were completed I tore down the roof and walls again and extended the foundations in all directions to complete the intended footprint &#8211; at least I tried to. Unfortunately the natural ground declines a bit towards the cliffs, and the game didn&#8217;t let me place the last row for lack of support.</p>\n<p>Adjacent foundations have to be built at the same height, so I had no other choice than to tear them all down and start over. However, there was lots of stuff lying around by now. Grrrr!</p>\n<p>What happened next was basically a game of Tetris. Move all facilities to one side, tear some foundations down, build new ones on a lower level, push everything onto those, destroy the rest&#8230;all while trying not to get a sunburn and hoping for the next sandstorm to take its sweet time.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8519" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8519 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8519">I&#8217;ve got the power! Still not enough though&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It all worked out in the end, and once the foundations were in place finishing the build wasn&#8217;t much of a problem.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using this base for about ten days since then, and I&#8217;m really digging it. Also, <em>now</em> I&#8217;m much more in my element again, namely taking something that&#8217;s already there and refining it to my liking. I add, remove or memodel bits and pieces all the time, and I&#8217;ll continue to do so until I&#8217;m completely satisfied.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;generator wing&#8221; seen above, for example, was a thorn in my side right from the start. Then I remembered that those things basically don&#8217;t have to be touched anymore once they&#8217;re up and running, so I built another floor on top of them and covered the gap with some stairs.

No, what&#8217;s really extraordinary is that each and every one of those hours felt exciting and full of discovery and adventure. I&#8217;m not exaggerating.</p>\n<p>If all survival games are like this I totally understand now why they are so popular.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8480" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8480 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures2.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8480">What exactly have you guys been doing here again&#8230;?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But what makes the game feel so different from basically anything else I&#8217;ve played? Well, there are quite a few contributing factors.</p>\n<p>First of all, there is actual danger. Heat, storms, radiation, fricking high rock formations and deep chasms, quicksand, overall pretty tough enemies and, of course, sandworms. On Arrakis absolutely everything is trying to kill you.</p>\n<p>Now, except for when <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/15/the-desert-giveth-shai-hulud-taketh-away/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">being swallowed by a worm</a> the penalty for dying usually isn&#8217;t all that harsh. You drop any Solari you had on you, and if you didn&#8217;t place a respawn beacon nearby you may find yourself quite a ways away from where you were. You can still go back and reclaim your cash though, so all you&#8217;ll lose is some time. And water. And probably some durability on your vehicle of choice.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8481" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8481 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8481">Oh, you&#8217;ve got to be kidding me</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Dying&#8217;s not the end of the world, is what I&#8217;m saying, but you&#8217;d still prefer it didn&#8217;t happen. Which is why I always try to be cautious and alert, and I&#8217;ve died only three times total thus far as a result.</p>\n<p>For me this really hits kind of a sweet spot. Death penalties suck ass in games where you inevitably die very often, possibly even without you having any chance to prevent it &#8211; think an MMORPG dungeon group wiping repeatedly because others aren&#8217;t doing their jobs.</p>\n<p>However, when dying is of absolutely no consequence there can be no sense of danger. So penalizing death, but not too severely, <em>and</em> giving me the agency to prevent it from ever happening (at least theoretically) is the optimal way to do it in my opinion, as it causes just the right amount of tension.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8482" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8482 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8482">I cranked up the brightness by a lot already, believe it or not</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As I said earlier, human beings and gigantic worms aren&#8217;t the only dangerous things on Arrakis. The area pictured on the two screenshots above is called Hagga Rift, and I&#8217;ve never seen, much less traversed, a more jagged and fascinating, yet also disorienting and treacherous landscape in a game before.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine getting around on foot or bike isn&#8217;t an easy feat here, and I got very confused during my first forays into the area. That it gets really dark the closer to the canyon&#8217;s bottom you get doesn&#8217;t help one bit.</p>\n<p>Even when I slowly started to know my way around the environment kept throwing curveballs at me. Like when I fell through a hole in the floor while looting a shipwreck (did I mention that it&#8217;s fricking dark down there?), only that said hole didn&#8217;t lead to where I thought it would &#8211; as it turned out I&#8217;d already been on the ship&#8217;s lowest deck, and I now found myself in a free fall all the way down into the canyon.

If there was any kind of procedural generation at work here it certainly doesn&#8217;t feel like it.</p>\n<p>Each of the various areas, despite technically all falling into the &#8220;desert biome&#8221; category for obvious reasons, has a very distinct style, and poses its own challenges when traversing it. Just the other day I ventured into another hitherto undiscovered region, and this one looks and feels completely different yet again (shown above). Reminds me a bit of Arizona, to be honest.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the landscape either, the enemies and their bases also have their very own aesthetics.

In the end I always do make it back of course, and that&#8217;s just the greatest and most satisfying sensation.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8486" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8486 size-full" height="305" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8486">We want it just like it was.

Well, there it is.</p>\n<p>Having a buggy really changes the game quite significantly. For one, its cutteray sucks so much more material out of resource nodes than the handheld version that it&#8217;s not even funny. Naturally it can also carry a crapton of stuff to go along with that, which is not only great for gathering, but also for moving shit around between bases &#8211; or for moving bases altogether.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8487" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8487 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8487">Leaving my Borg Cube behind for good&#8230;more about my new base next time</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At this stage of the game these features aren&#8217;t just nice to have though, they pretty much become a necessity. Building things like better refineries, bigger water cisterns and so on requires more and more resources, and as a consequence your base keeps growing not only in size, but also in terms of how much stuff you have crammed into it.</p>\n<p>Which is another thing that Dune: Awakening does very well in my opinion: progression.</p>\n<p>It all feels very natural to me, and it&#8217;s paced just right. Moving through the resource tiers happens more or less on autopilot thus far, and I feel neither forced to rush anything, nor held back in any way. It&#8217;s also very satisfying to progress to the next tier because of little details like, for instance, the bigger ore refinery not only allowing you to process new types of materials, but also being more efficient when refining the &#8220;old&#8221; tiers.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8488" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8488 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8488">These things keep getting bigger and bigger though</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I really like how the skill trees open up more and more over time, too. Many abilities and passives have three ranks, but when you first gain access to a new class you can only spend points on the first rank of each. Working for the advanced trainers (most of which are found in either Arakeen or Harko Village) unlocks the second and third ranks as well as the special Spice-skills over the course of several quests.</p>\n<p>Since basically everything you do in the game rewards XP you keep levelling up all the time (I&#8217;m currently at level 129), and as each ding grants one additional skill point they tend to pile up. Thus, whenever I&#8217;ve increased the rank of a skill tree or unlocked a new one, I&#8217;ve always had just about the right amount of available skill points to pick or level up the ones that seemed useful to me.</p>\n<p>One thing that&#8217;s severely lacking, though, is having skill loadouts or something like that. It&#8217;s really tedious to swap around skills one by one, and since we can choose only three at a time (until you&#8217;ve reached a certain point in the main story it&#8217;s actually only <em>two</em>) not switching at all isn&#8217;t an option. Please, Funcom, do it! Give it a cooldown of a minute or two, I don&#8217;t care, but we really need this.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures11.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8489 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures11.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>And that shall be enough for today.

Well, when I realized that I didn&#8217;t have nearly enough screenshots of Imperial Testing Station No. 10 for <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/10/arrakis-is-a-perilous-place-even-in-the-shade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my post about the adventure I had in there</a> I decided to pay Station No. 2 another visit and take some more there. And, to be quite honest, I&#8217;d become a bit too comfy and carefree by then, so instead of hugging the rocky areas as much as possible I took a pretty long route across open sand. I thought that I&#8217;d be okay as long as I stayed clear of drum sand.</p>\n<p>I was mistaken. When the aggro meter turned red while I was still a couple hundred meters away from safety I knew I was in trouble. Luckily I had a booster equipped to the sandbike (the alternatives being a cargo crate or passenger seat), and I saved that for the moment you see on the picture above so as to not overheat it too early.</p>\n<p>How close of a call was it? Well&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8441" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8441 size-full" height="303" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8441">When the red squiggly line seen below me looks like this, GTFO!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The moment I hit the screenshot key I thought I was done for. But lo and behold, one second later the worm stopped its chase and disappeared below the sand for good. Phew (once again)!</p>\n<p>However, just a day later I wasn&#8217;t so lucky.</p>\n<p>At that point various contracts were asking me to venture further north, and to do so one has to traverse the first instances of quicksand. While moving on drum sand &#8220;only&#8221; increases worm aggro, quicksand is (as far as I know) a death trap for players and vehicles alike. And it&#8217;s fricking everywhere.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8442" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8442 size-full" height="349" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8442">Drum sand due south, lots and lots of quicksand up north</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While it is marked clearly on the map, and also looks a bit different from normal sand in the game world itself, I didn&#8217;t want to risk my bike regardless, so I decided to walk.</p>\n<p>Outside of drum sand I&#8217;d never had aggroed a worm while on foot until then, so I thought this to be the safest option.</p>\n<p>Once more I was mistaken. When the worm came I used everything I had at my disposal to escape, but even with <em>Bindu Sprint</em> and <em>Shigawire Claw</em> (from the Bene Gesserit and Trooper skill tree, respectively) I was much too slow. No screenshots, by the way, as I was panicking and had better (albeit futile) things to do.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8443" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8443 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8443">Can someone take me off this godforsaken planet already?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I won&#8217;t spoil exactly what happens after that, but in the end I was standing at my chosen respawn point in my undies.

In the bigger camps and dungeons they&#8217;re usually located in or past the boss room, or all the way at the top in the more vertical ones, and basically can&#8217;t be missed. In smaller places they&#8217;re sometimes tucked away around corners or in little side rooms or caves though, so keep your eyes open.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8445" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8445 size-full" height="301" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques7.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8445">This is what they usually look like</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Each of these chests has its own loot-table. Once opened they respawn after 45 minutes, and if there&#8217;s more than one schematic to be had it&#8217;s random which one you get.</p>\n<p>Which, to be honest, can be quite infuriating. I have, for example, farmed one specific chest for days on end, because I wanted to get my hands on the unique rifle that only drops there. Said rifle is just one of three schematics on that chest&#8217;s table though, and I got the (also useful) sandbike engine once, and the scattergun (which I didn&#8217;t want at all) <em>six fricking times</em> before the rifle finally made an appearance.</p>\n<p>I have even logged off there to do something else for a while, then logged back in just to loot the chest again.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8446" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8446 size-full" height="315" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8446">Sometimes they&#8217;re smaller for some reason</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Despite the RNG repeatedly being a dick I quite enjoy this whole part of the gameplay loop though. It lets me gear up to the point of (almost) being overpowered for the current tier, which makes the transition to the next much less arduous. It also incentivises going back to places you&#8217;ve already been &#8211; which you most likely would have to anyway for crafting mats and the like &#8211; so you don&#8217;t burn through each area quite as fast.</p>\n<p>Which, for me, is a good thing. I&#8217;m in no hurry to advance to the &#8220;endgame&#8221;, as that, by most accounts and at the time of this writing, seems to be the least appealing aspect of the game.</p>\n<p>Also, I&#8217;m still having a blast in this relatively early part of the experience, and I&#8217;m definitely going to savour it some more. That being said, I&#8217;m now almost ready to advance into tier three and start working towards building the buggy.

You go there, clear them out, loot everything and leave again. Calling these places &#8216;dungeons&#8217; would be overstating things, because they range from a single campfire to a couple of adjacent rooms or caverns at most.</p>\n<p>However, there are <em>real</em> dungeons too. They go by the rather unimpressive name <em>&#8220;Imperial Testing Station No. XY&#8221;</em>, but I assure you, they are anything but.</p>\n<p>You get to explore the first one of those, Station No. 2 (don&#8217;t ask me what happened to No. 1&#8230;) in the newbie region already, and while that wasn&#8217;t a cakewalk when I went there only a couple of hours into the game, it didn&#8217;t quite make me break a sweat either.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8405" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8405 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8405">Doesn&#8217;t look too intimidating, now does it?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The other day a contract (i.e. side quest) asked me to investigate Imperial Testing Station No. 10, which is located to the far east of my current area. So I stocked up on ammo, bandages and water, mounted my sandbike and got going.</p>\n<p>The entrance (seen above) looks pretty much exactly like that of Station No. 2, so I thought I knew what to expect. And I did&#8230;but, as it would soon turn out, not really.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests these places are (or were) facilities for scientific or military research, and past the entrance they lie completely underground. Hence you have to go down some pretty steep and long ramps at first.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8406" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8406 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon4.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8406">Good thing I&#8217;m not claustrophobic</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I could soon tell that the enemies here are tougher and more numerous than I was used to, and I had to fight tooth and nail from the get-go. Many of them have a Holtzman shield now (to be fair, so have I), and most packs have at least one heavy gunner, who wield some kind of gatling gun.</p>\n<p>Fortunately my usual tactic of aggroing a group, then backtracking a bit and hiding behind something or around a corner works even better in the tight confines of these stations. This way the guys with melee weapons will sprint after you first, and you can hopefully dispatch them with your own knife or sword before their homies catch up.</p>\n<p>I also made generous use of grenades and turrets, and generally kept kiting and using cover as much as I could.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8407" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8407 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8407">Some of these shots were actually taken someplace else&#8230;I had more pressing things to do than sightseeing!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I was so tense and focused the whole time that I didn&#8217;t pay attention to how long I was at it already, but after a while it dawned on me&#8230;this thing just kept going, and going, and going still.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for me you can&#8217;t really get lost down there (I hate mazes with a passion). Sometimes a path branches off, but one of the two options always leads to a dead end soon, so there&#8217;s effectively only one way you can go. At least that wasn&#8217;t a concern.</p>\n<p>But what if I&#8217;d died? I&#8217;m not sure how quickly enemies respawn, but it&#8217;s seemingly something like 10-15 minutes. Which means that I would have had to fight my way down here again all the way from the top.</p>\n<p>Then I remembered that one of the things you can craft on the fly, provided you have the resources on hand, is a placeable respawn beacon. By then I had looted enough scrap metal to make a couple, so I plopped one down right away, just to be safe.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8408" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8408 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon6.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8408">How big <strong>is</strong> this place?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Deeper and deeper I went, with no end in sight. Aside from loot chests and enemies &#8211; of whom I&#8217;d probably dispatched nearly fifty by now &#8211; I found various audio recordings providing the place&#8217;s backstory. Don&#8217;t ask me about that though, for I was much too focused on the path ahead of me to actually listen.</p>\n<p>To make things even more tense my supply of ammo and bandages had started to noticably wane by now. You find that stuff left and right, but I was consuming even more than I got. About time to finish this, I thought.</p>\n<p>Then I <em>finally</em> came to a door with a green energy barrier, which I assumed had to lead into the boss room.</p>\n<p>You see, such barriers are usually red at first, unless you have already found the corresponding &#8216;identification band&#8217;. I hadn&#8217;t picked up any kind of key during my whole run, so why was this one green? Ah, but I&#8217;d seen this before, in Testing Station No. 2! As soon as I&#8217;d walked through the door there it turned red and wouldn&#8217;t let me get out until the boss was dead.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8409" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8409 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon7.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8409">Looks so inviting&#8230;should say &#8220;DANGER AHEAD&#8221; instead!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I placed a new respawn beacon right in front of the door, checked my weapons and bandages one last time, and went in.</p>\n<p>I found myself in a large, two-story hangar of sorts, and immediately had to fight for my life. I used the same tactics as before and dispatched the first batch of enemies, then another one. While doing so I noticed someone shooting at me from quite a distance&#8230;sniper! I tried to always have something between us while fighting the others, but still got hit once, and all of a sudden I was poisoned.</p>\n<p>I started losing health fast while still fighting some other guy. Luckily I managed to finish him off quickly and applied a bandage right away. I don&#8217;t know if that stopped the poison or if it had just worn off by then, but my health bar turned from green to red again and I could heal up to full normally. Phew.</p>\n<p>Using every bit of cover I could find I then got near enough for the sniper to switch to a different weapon, but I just made short work of him with my knife.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8410" style="width: 1208px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8410 size-full" height="771" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon8.jpg" width="1208" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8410">The slow blade penetrates the shield!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I had assumed the sniper to be the boss, but apparently not. By now the contract had updated its objective to &#8220;Kill Inna Hiller&#8221;, and that wasn&#8217;t checked off yet.</p>\n<p>The hangar&#8217;s upper level was clear now, but the doors (plural because there&#8217;s one at both ends) were still red, so I went downstairs &#8211; only to get instantly perforated by a heavy gunner. Seriously, I went from full shields and health to dead in like three seconds, tops. Guess I&#8217;d found the boss, eh?</p>\n<p>I respawned on my beacon and went in again. I had learned by now that Holtzman shields are turned off whenever the wearer fires a ranged weapon, but considering how quickly I&#8217;d died I wanted her not to shoot <em>me</em> of course. So I tried to get her to start firing, only to immediately take cover and let my grenades and turret do the work, which, after a while, did the trick. Phew again. But what&#8217;s that? This wasn&#8217;t Inna Hiller either?!?</p>\n<p>At least the doors were green now, so on to the next room. This one was much smaller, but also with some opportunities to take cover. To my relief these four enemies didn&#8217;t pose much of a problem, and now the contract was finally completed.

These aren&#8217;t consumables that you buy or craft and then equip like in most games, but come from the Trooper skill <em>Explosive Grenade</em>. If you play the game and haven&#8217;t already, I highly suggest to unlock that and give it a try. It&#8217;s <em>so</em> helpful! If you have a Technique-slot to spare also use <em>Battle Hardened</em> to reduce its cooldown a little (as well as that of all other Trooper skills, including the grappling hook).</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8412" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8412 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8412">My work is done!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m not exaggerating when I say that it&#8217;s been a very, <em>very</em> long time since I had a solo PvE experience as gripping as this one.</p>\n<p>Now, do I want every session to be like this? Hell no! Those one and a half hours (or however long it actually was) left me completely exhausted. But I was also exhilarated, and so very pleased with myself at the end!

In the case of Valheim, fellow bloggers like <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/search/label/Valheim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bhagpuss</a> and <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/category/valheim/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wilhelm</a> made it sound quite fun, too.</p>\n<p>I, however, played none of them despite all the praise they got. The very idea of having to take care of a character who needs to eat and drink, who can be too hot or too cold, and/or who also needs shelter lest the faintest of breezes kills him within seconds, just sounded like the antithesis of fun to me. I’m pretty sure that I actually tried a game with similar mechanics a long time ago…I can’t for the life of me remember what it was, but my vague memories of it aren’t fond either way.</p>\n<p>The thing is though, these games usually <em>do</em> have a whole bunch of features and characteristics that very much appeal to me, namely exploration, resource gathering, crafting and, above all, base building. Which is why, despite said dislike of survival mechanics, I’ve always eyed them curiously from the sidelines.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8370 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Hence when I started to read really good things about <em>Dune: Awakening</em>, for example over at <a href="https://chasingdings.com/category/mmos/dune-awakening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chasing Dings!</a>, <a href="https://www.heartlessgamer.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heartless Gamer</a> and <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Friendly Necromancer</a>, an ever growing desire to try it out took hold of me. Next thing I know is that I’m watching various videos about the game on YouTube, and once I see what players are capable of doing with its base building system I can’t resist any longer.</p>\n<p>Thus I finally decided to harden up and add some spice to my gaming diet &#8211; literally.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that I’ve only played about fifteen hours up to now, so these are going to be impressions of just the early game. To give you the bottom line up front though: I&#8217;m really digging it so far.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8371 size-full" height="278" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with why I chose this game over the others.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m not the biggest Dune fan ever &#8211; I&#8217;ve actually yet to read the novels &#8211; I quite like the first movie as well as the new ones. In terms of aesthetics and vibe the Denis Villeneuve films really are something else, and the game is very much based on those. The story takes place in an alternate timeline, but one that&#8217;s pretty interesting.</p>\n<p>Specific IP aside, I&#8217;ll take a futuristic, or shall we say &#8216;technologically advanced&#8217; setting over fantasy, dark ages or some such any day of the week.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the game looks freaking awesome. I&#8217;m by no means a graphics-snob, but here the high level of detail and realism really help to get the feel from the movies across.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8372 size-full" height="298" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read my ramblings about <i>ArcheAge</i> or <i>The Secret World</i> you know that I love me a flexible skill system. Not only does Dune: Awakening have that, you can actually unlock <i>all</i> classes on one character.</p>\n<p>You accumulate a crapton of skillpoints over time, too. I assume that it won&#8217;t be enough to unlock absolutely everything, but it seems that you&#8217;ll at the very least be able to create the combat build of your choice while also having all traversal skills as well as the various passives to gather more resources, consume less durability and so on active at the same time.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t like your build anymore or find that you&#8217;ve missed something important, fret not. Respeccing the whole thing can be done every 48 hours and doesn&#8217;t cost a thing.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8373 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Speaking of traversal, holy macaroni, the game is really fun in this regard, even before you&#8217;ve built any of the awesome vehicles.</p>\n<p>Spread across the classes you can unlock a grappling hook, an extremely fast sprint and an anti-gravity-bubble, and there’s also an equippable hover-device to either craft or loot. While these are already great on their own their real strenght comes into play when combined. For example, use the hook to propel yourself up a cliff, then press Space in mid-air to hover, and your momentum will carry you much higher or further.</p>\n<p>Getting up and down the game&#8217;s mountains, some of which being actually pretty high (and falling damage is a thing of course), becomes quite easy once you get the hang of it. And also, like I said, a lot of fun.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8374 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>As of yet I&#8217;ve only managed to build the smallest of the vehicles, the sandbike seen above. Even with only tier one parts it’s already much faster than running, and since the game world is anything but small owning one speeds up resource gathering trips or bandit base raids considerably. To no-one’s surprise it&#8217;s also a hoot to drive.</p>\n<p>My next goal is the sand buggy. The name is a bit misleading I feel, because it&#8217;s actually more like a hauler with lots of carrying capacity and built-in mining laser. A gatherer&#8217;s wet dream, in other words.</p>\n<p>The Ornithopters, of which there are three variants, should be the most fun of course, but those will probably take me a good while to get.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8375 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Resource acquisition comes in various flavors.</p>\n<p>Whenever you&#8217;re in an area where specific stuff can be found, some of it just lies on the ground here and there, waiting to be picked up. The amounts you get that way are pretty negligible though, even early on.</p>\n<p>What you&#8217;re really after is resource nodes. Those usually look like a big rock, clump or stack made out of the material in question. Scan these nodes with your mining tool and then cut along the blue line that appears to break them and get a good chunk of the stuff.</p>\n<p>Once you’re able to build a dew scythe you can collect water from plants, but early on most of this precious resource will come from siphoning off dead opponents’ blood and purifying it. The next step up the ladder will be to dissolve whole corpses in some kind of high-tech sarcophagus (I kid you not).</p>\n<p>Collecting Spice has again its own mechanics, but I&#8217;ll talk about that when I&#8217;ve experienced it myself.</p>\n<p>Overall I like how resource acquisition works in this game quite a lot. Since looting dead enemies and their bases, shipwrecks and research stations is yet another way to get your hands on valuable stuff there&#8217;s much variety here, so things shouldn&#8217;t get boring too quickly.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8376 size-full" height="293" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>This is my first base, and it&#8217;s obviously crap. I hastily slapped the first iteration of it down while the sun was scorching me, and instead of starting over from scratch at night I just kept adding to it whenever I needed more space. I didn&#8217;t know yet that <em>all</em> of the resources are refunded when you tear something down again, which is really great as it incentivises trying stuff out and also takes the sting out of relocating.</p>\n<p>Which will probably happen a couple of times, so this one is temporary anyway. I&#8217;ll design something better &#8211; hopefully much better &#8211; for my main base, once I know where I actually want to build that.</p>\n<p>Provided I’ll find an open spot there, that is &#8211; this <i>is</i> open world housing after all. It seems to me that there&#8217;s lots of space to go around though, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, the building system itself is pretty spiffy and, like I said, some folks have done ridiculously cool stuff with it already.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8377 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So what about the survival mechanics then?</p>\n<p>To my surprise I&#8217;m totally fine with them. I would actually go as far as saying that I prefer them being in the game just the way they are, instead of having none at all. Why? Because they add a little bit of tension and thus a sense of danger and adventure, while in reality not being <i>that</i> dangerous after all.</p>\n<p>You see, there is no hunger, so all you need is water, and that&#8217;s not really much of a problem right from the start. Sure, you can&#8217;t outright ignore it, but the game doesn&#8217;t make it overly hard for you to stay alive.</p>\n<p>Freezing at night ain&#8217;t a thing, but sunstroke sure is. To avoid that you only need to find yourself a bit of shadow though, so that&#8217;s usually not a big problem. Even if you do overheat, all that happens is that your hydration wanes much faster, and, again, you quite quickly get to a point where water reserves become more or less a non-issue (for your body at least; it seems that higher tier crafting will require tons of it, too).</p>\n<p>Aside from that there&#8217;s sandstorms and, of course, Shai-Hulud, aka sandworms. I don’t know yet how that might change later on, but in the starting area avoiding both is a concern, but not hard to do at all.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressionsx.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8378 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressionsx.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So, yeah, all things considered I really like what this game has to offer so far, and I haven’t even talked about crafting or combat yet as this is already getting long as it is.</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">To me Dune: Awakening is more than the sum of its parts anyway. Playing it feels like I&#8217;m having a big, exciting adventure, and that’s one of the things I enjoy the most when playing video games.</span></p>\n<p>More to follow.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/07/its-time-to-spice-things-up/feed/', 'slash_comments': '4', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/437dcc44b8a84b55b593db055be0b2ad5e4f7270a3a8d9b83303bcaa0310d98d?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressionsx.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I do appreciate having the ability to destroy a game&#8217;s environment (anyone else looking forward to <em>Battlefield 6</em>, by the way?

Once again I was inspired to try out someone new by seeing him do his thing in the live-action adaptation made by Marvel Studios.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t tell you whether it&#8217;s actually any good as an adaptation because I know nothing about the comics, but the show in and of itself is absolutely brilliant in my opinion.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s very much carried by Oscar Isaac, who plays the character(s) to perfection. The way he switches from Marc Spector to Steven Grant or vice versa in a heartbeat, completely changing his accent and speech melody, as well as his whole demeanor and body language, is nothing short of amazing. Sometimes you can see the transition in his eyes alone! I liked him as an actor before, but this performance easily made him one of my favourites.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;m a big fan of ancient egyptian mythology, Moon Knight&#8217;s adventures also get bonus points from me for their themes and setting. In any case, I can strongly recommend watching the show if you haven&#8217;t yet.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8307" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8307 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight1.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8307">&#8220;Oh, the idiot&#8217;s in control&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;I heard that!&#8221; *angrily shakes his fist*</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So what about the ARPG&#8217;s take on Khonshu&#8217;s avatar?</p>\n<p>I think he&#8217;s really fun. Unlike some other heroes he isn&#8217;t more or less locked into either melee or ranged combat, as he&#8217;s got various abilities of both flavors at his disposal. He can even morph some of them into one or the other via his talents and traits, which are unlocked from level 32 onward.</p>\n<p>When fighting up close he uses weapons like truncheons, nunchucks and a bo staff, while depending on his signature crescent blades for ranged combat. Strangely, some skills have him shoot those blades out of a pair of pistols. I don&#8217;t know how that&#8217;s supposed to work, but I assume that it&#8217;s canon.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8308" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8308 size-full" height="308" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight2.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8308">&#8220;Did he just throw the gun??&#8221; Well, not exactly&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>His unique resource is called <em>Khonshu&#8217;s Favor</em>. It starts out empty, and some abilities build it up over time. Once at 100% he can use either of two spenders (or both at the same time if specced for it), which completely depletes all favor and gives him big buffs for quite a while.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s great about this is that most of his skills need no resources whatsoever, so you can basically use everything off cooldown, and spam those that don&#8217;t have one endlessly.</p>\n<p>His signature ability is a barrage of very quick attacks with a big finisher at the end. This one, too, can be switched between melee and ranged, and while the former does more damage I prefer the latter as it&#8217;s much easier (and also safer) to use. You can &#8220;weave&#8221; it around a bit if you&#8217;re quick, but in essence it&#8217;s a single-target skill, which is quite unusual for a signature. The upside is that it literally melts bosses&#8230;well, not <em>literally</em>, but&#8230;you know what I mean&#8230;and that&#8217;s a trade-off I&#8217;m very willing to make.</p>\n<p>His Ultimate, however, is by no means lacking in room clearing capability, as it peppers a pretty large area with gunfire and rockets for 20 seconds straight. You can still move and attack with your other skills in the meantime, too. Great stuff.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8309" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8309 size-full" height="315" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8309">Call in the Batwing&#8230;err&#8230;I mean, the &#8220;Moon Copter&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I gotta say, I really appreciate how unique every hero I&#8217;ve tried up to now plays and feels. I believe they doubled down on this when they released the BUE (Biggest Update Ever) in January &#8217;17, and while that patch was met with a ton of criticism by the playerbase as well, I think they did a good job in this regard at the very least.</p>\n<p>I also really like how much control I have over each character&#8217;s specific playstyle. The aforementioned traits &#8211; it&#8217;s basically a talent tree that lets you choose one out of three options every few levels &#8211; offer more substantial alterations to a hero&#8217;s kit than most games do. Said switching between melee and ranged capabilities, or giving an attack a huge damage boost and additional DoT in exchange for a longer cooldown are just a few examples.</p>\n<p>Granted, I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface so far, what with 58 more heroes waiting to be played. But, again, the ones I have given a shot are really unique and fun, and Moon Knight is no exception.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8310" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8310 size-full" height="355" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8310">&#8220;What are we wearing??&#8221; &#8220;She said I needed a suit.&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, the ceremonial armor from Khonshu&#8217;s temple, not psycho Colonel Sanders!&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Basically the only thing that he&#8217;s lacking is a high-quality costume based on his signature armor from the show &#8211; which is no surprise of course, as the game was shut down five years before that even came out. Fortunately the one I&#8217;m wearing on all screenshots seen in this post, based on Steven Grant&#8217;s version of MK (known as &#8220;Mr. Knight&#8221;, I believe), comes pretty close to the one Oscar Isaac wears when Steven&#8217;s in charge, so that&#8217;s at least something.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s enough for today.

Several times during the video the host says that this character or that weapon should totally be leveled up to the maximum because &#8220;it&#8217;s a free power upgrade&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve played any gacha game before I don&#8217;t need to tell you this, but in case you haven&#8217;t: the resources to level stuff up are far from being free!</p>\n<p>Now, I know what they <em>mean</em> by saying that. To farm for things in this type of game you need stamina (in ZZZ it&#8217;s called battery charge), which replenishes on its own over time. So, <em>technically speaking</em>, given enough time you have a virtually unlimited amount at your disposal, which of course cannot be said about gacha currency, hence the distinction.</p>\n<p>However, in reality there&#8217;s quite a bunch of caveats to calling those upgrade mats &#8220;free&#8221;.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8279" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8279 size-full" height="270" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8279">I sure as hell didn&#8217;t get all this just because I&#8217;m such a nice guy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For one, your stamina pool always has a cap. Usually it&#8217;s 24 hours worth of recharge, sometimes even less, which means that you have to spend it very regularly in order to use as much as the game is willing to hand out to you.</p>\n<p>More importantly though, to spend stamina you actually have to, you know, <em>do stuff</em>. I mean, that goes without saying, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>Now, granted, in ZZZ I can burn six hours&#8217; worth of battery in about ten seconds if I&#8217;m in a hurry (or actually need and want just the most basic of materials), but even that can become a chore if done each and every day. Hell, spending my stamina in <em>Genshin Impact</em> became such a burden after a while that I had to <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2021/08/24/oh-boy-here-we-go-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quit playing altogether</a> for a long time. But to my point, even if stuff like this <em>does</em> only take a couple of minutes each day &#8211; that&#8217;s still not fricking <em>free</em>!</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8280" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8280 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8280">Even adopting a cute cat was <strong>a lot</strong> of work, believe you me</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But what about rewards I get just for logging in &#8211; those are surely freebies, aren&#8217;t they?</p>\n<p>Well, here&#8217;s the thing. The idea behind all of this, whether it&#8217;s &#8220;only&#8221; farming a bunch of stages for a couple of minutes or even &#8220;just&#8221; logging in, is that at least <em>some</em> players will not immediately log out again. <em>Since I&#8217;m already here</em>, they might say to themselves, <em>maybe I&#8217;ll also take a quick peek at the new event</em>, or whatever. And before they know it they&#8217;ve spent an hour or more in the game. And <em>time</em>, seemingly contrary to some people&#8217;s opinion, is neither free nor without value.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the incentive to log in can be so big that it might lead to stuff happening that you didn&#8217;t actually want to happen at all. Here&#8217;s an example. A couple of weeks ago an email informed me about ZZZ celebrating its first anniversary by gifting everyone an S-rank character and weapon of their choosing from the standard pool.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to play that game anymore (I even <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/06/06/eight-years-of-blogging-about-mostly-old-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said so</a> not too long ago), but this? Well, guess what&#8230;I re-installed and patched up the ~70 GB client, claimed the &#8220;free&#8221; stuff and then thought to myself, well, now I kinda want to try them out, and let&#8217;s have a look at what&#8217;s new in the game, too, and&#8230;sure enough I went and played the game for many hours over the following couple of weeks.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8281" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281 size-full" height="283" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8281">They sure know how to tug those heartstrings</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As long as I&#8217;m having fun that&#8217;s not actually a bad thing though, is it?</p>\n<p>Not really, no. Playing the story chapters I&#8217;d missed, visiting new areas and doing some events really <em>was</em> quite fun. However, considering that I&#8217;d much rather play <em>Marvel Heroes</em> right now, the fact that they&#8217;ve managed to pull me back in, and that I now feel almost obligated &#8211; again &#8211; to at least log in and spend some battery every day (and tend to my video store, and hang out with my agents, and&#8230;see what I mean?) does bug me quite a bit.</p>\n<p>And, yeah, that&#8217;s completely on me, I do realize that. Nobody <em>forces</em> me to do anything. I know for a fact that I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s susceptible to these practices though &#8211; which is exactly why they exist in the first place of course. That&#8217;s why we should stop pretending (or actually believing) that it&#8217;s all completely harmless, and that game developers give so much stuff away solely out of the kindness of their hearts.</p>\n<p>That all being said, I&#8217;m not here to tell you that you shouldn&#8217;t enjoy collecting login rewards, spending your stamina or whatever. If those things make you happy and don&#8217;t lure you into spending your time on gameplay you don&#8217;t actually fancy doing, more power to you.</p>\n<p>But please, let&#8217;s stop calling stuff <em>free</em> when it actually isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Blaugust 2025 post count: 3</span></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/08/11/most-free-stuff-actually-isnt/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/437dcc44b8a84b55b593db055be0b2ad5e4f7270a3a8d9b83303bcaa0310d98d?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/blaugust2025-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz20.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Having concluded the Avengers timeline&#8230;Thanos timeline&#8230;whatever you wanna call it, I&#8217;m now revisiting the few good flicks operating outside of that. Ok, if you also count the X-Men franchise it&#8217;s actually more than a few, but I&#8217;ve watched those too recently to go back to them yet again.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m mostly talking about stand-alone entries now. For example, I still quite enjoy <em>Punisher: War Zone</em> (rest in peace, Ray Stevenson), and just the other day I had an absolute blast with 2018&#8217;s <em>Venom</em> once again.</p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;d just hit level cap with the Punisher in <em>Marvel Heroes</em> I thought, well, what better time to give everyone&#8217;s favourite symbiote a spin. Boy, what a great decision that was.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8249" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8249 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8249">WE are Venom!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Like many heroes (or villains&#8230;depending on who you ask, I guess) he has his own mechanics and special resource to go along with it. Actually he has <em>two</em> resources to manage, because some of his abilities consume his own hitpoints, and also deal more damage the less he has left. To make permanently running around on low health feasible he&#8217;s a pretty tanky dude, and I&#8217;m looking forward to how this feels at higher levels.</p>\n<p>His unique resource is called <em>Ichor</em>, and it looks the part. Yuck. Thankfully it starts at full when you enter a level, unlike, say, Scarlet Witch&#8217;s <em>Chaos Energy</em>, which has to be built up first (I don&#8217;t know her full kit though, so take this with a grain of salt).</p>\n<p>Consequently you can go all-in right from the start, spending Ichor as well as hitpoints galore. As long as you weave in abilities that recharge at least one or the other, depending on what you need, you should be good.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8250" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8250 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8250">Have a nice life</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Most importantly, it plays well, and also looks and feels really great. It&#8217;s hard to get good screenshots of it, because his powers move so damn fast and twitchy (as they should), but I hope it comes across at least somewhat on the ones I&#8217;m showing here.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8251" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8251 size-full" height="330" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8251">So many snacks, so little time</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Having played a new (to me) hero for a couple of hours now has also highlighted some more aspects of the game where the developers went the extra mile to make each of them unique and fun.</p>\n<p>For example, every character has a basic movement ability right from the start. It&#8217;s basically a short dash, meant to get out of harm&#8217;s way quickly. The Punisher does a forward roll, Captain America lunges with his shield held in front of him, Venom shoots a tendril of ichor and then pulls himself after it. Some are too lazy to move on their own and just teleport.</p>\n<p>It gets really crazy at level 10 though, when everyone gets their &#8220;travel power&#8221;. These aren&#8217;t for combat (they even have a short cast-time), but they&#8217;re a godsend for traversing the huge maps quickly. And I mean <em>quickly</em>. I really wish every ARPG had something like this, because not only takes it the sting out of any backtracking you might have to do, it&#8217;s also <em>fun as hell</em>!</p>\n<p>Cap and the Punisher just sprint really fast, Blade, Wolverine and Ghost Rider&#8230;well, ride their motorbikes, while Iron Man, Wanda and others fricking <em>fly</em> (Ant-Man rides a flying ant of course)! It&#8217;s not just for show either. While they can&#8217;t go over higher obstacles like freight containers or buildings, getting to another floor level or from rooftop to rooftop without taking the stairs or bridges is no problem. And as for Venom, well&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8252" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8252 size-full" height="310" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8252">Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Holy macarony, how awesome is <em>that</em>? I assume Spidey and Carnage do something similar. Mechanically it&#8217;s the same as flying, so bonus points for that.</p>\n<p>Of course each hero also has their own lore-appropriate ultimate ability.\xa0 Iron Man activates the <em>House Party Protocol</em>, the Punisher calls in an armored and armed-to-the-teeth van that would make B.A. Baracus blush, and Cap&#8230;take a guess&#8230;<em>AVENGERS ASSEMBLE</em>!</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re really powerful, too. To balance that they have a whopping 10 minute cooldown to begin with, but you can shave that down to 7 or so (I think) by upgrading it.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8253" style="width: 1237px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8253 size-full" height="726" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom6.jpg" width="1237" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8253">Hell yeah, THAT&#8217;S what I&#8217;m talking about</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another cute tidbit is how heroes automatically talk to each other when they meet in the hub areas. When I&#8217;m standing around with the Punisher and an Iron Man walks by, my guy says &#8220;You should stick to making the hardware, Stark, not using it!&#8221;, for example.</p>\n<p>Sure, stuff like that can get repetitive after a while, but I usually can&#8217;t help but chuckle at the amount of snark these guys have for one another. I wonder whether this is where the <em>Overwatch</em> devs took their inspiration from, because those heroes do it in quite a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>Now you&#8217;ll have to excuse me though, those bad guys aren&#8217;t gonna bite off their heads themselves&#8230;</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Blaugust 2025 post count: 2</span></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/08/05/with-great-power-comes-great-fun/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/437dcc44b8a84b55b593db055be0b2ad5e4f7270a3a8d9b83303bcaa0310d98d?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom6.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

There were supposed to be 4 people, but only 3 really stay there.</p>\n<p>I don\'t beef with my dormmates. We usually get along well. But not her. She was spoiled rotten — guess I should\'ve expected it. Her parents could get her transferred to a public school, after all. But the thing is, I <em>don\'t</em> mind. I don\'t mind her personal lifestyle habits; I don\'t mind if she has to take 30-min long showers and blow her hair for an additional 20; I don\'t mind if she had to sleep through the first period; I don\'t mind if she has to use 2 desks to put all her stuff, since there were only 3 people anyways so we had a spare desk. I <em>don\'t</em> mind any of these.</p>\n<p>What I <em>do</em> mind, a <em>lot</em>, is her blatant disrespect for everybody else. It was like she thought she was the main character and everyone else is an NPC.</p>\n<p>We got along for a while. But there were signs. The most obvious one was the card thing. We had to use our school cards to swipe the dorm door open. One day, I was inside and heard knocking, so I opened the door. She was outside and went in. I asked her, in a chitchat manner, &quot;forgot your card?&quot; And she replied, &quot;no, it\'s in my bag, it\'s just too much trouble to take it out.&quot;</p>\n<p>There were so many things wrong with this interaction I don\'t even know where to start. She legit thought it was okay to trouble other people to avoid troubling herself. And the fact that she <em>said</em> it out loud, to my face, proves that she <em>did not even think that was wrong</em>. I\'m convinced that to this day, as I\'m writing this post, she still thinks that <em>I</em> am the asshole for not even wanting to do the extremely simple task of opening the door at her bidding — can\'t Tofu <em>see</em> how hard it is for me to take the card out of my bag??/s</p>\n<p>(By the way, we use our cards to buy food too — would be a shame if she starved because she could not get her card out of her bag.)</p>\n<p>That was the first time. On the second time, after asking &quot;forgot your card?&quot; and receiving a similar answer again, I got pissed and said, &quot;I\'m just a servant to you, right?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-03-19.html#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>&quot; Upon hearing that, she slammed the door — which was nice, actually; she loves leaving the door open behind her until someone else (usually me) goes to close it.</p>\n<p>I don\'t know her exact age but she couldn\'t have been younger than 17. We\'re nearly adults. She still acts like a literal spoiled baby.</p>\n<p>Apparently, my servant statement was the breaking point for her. Yeah, an off-handed, casual half-insult. During later arguments she would constantly bring that line up and go &quot;how are you a servant? How come I think you\'re my servant?&quot; or something like that, probably thinking she actually had a coherent argument, or anything better she could nitpick about my behavior. Again, like a child.</p>\n<p>The breaking point for <em>me</em>, however, was the trash can thing. So our dorms don\'t have trash cans in them; we had to bring our own. But most of the time, there were cans left by the previous inhabitants of the dorm. Not this time though. So I brought a trash can here, along with trash bags, for us three to use.</p>\n<p>I had <em>one</em> rule: if it\'s empty, put a bag in it. The bags are here. Right here, for everyone to take. Grab one. Put it in the can. And <em>then</em> throw trash.</p>\n<p>She kept on throwing trash into a bare can. I talked to her. I told her, the bags are right there, put one in! She could take none of it. I didn\'t throw wet stuff! Those are all dry stuff that wouldn\'t stick to the can! What\'s wrong with that?</p>\n<p>Km km. It is my trash can; you can follow my <em>one and only rule</em> or I could just <em>not</em> let you use it.</p>\n<p>I put the can on my table. It\'s mine now. Neither of you gets to use it. Actually I would\'ve let the third girl use it anyways since <em>she</em> didn\'t do anything wrong, but whatever.</p>\n<p>Then came the maddening thing: she <strong>still threw stuff into the can anyways</strong>. <strong>Not only behind my back, but also right in front of me, even!</strong> She walked over to me desk, threw some shit in, muttering &quot;I\'ll borrow this for a bit, thank you<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-03-19.html#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.&quot;</p>\n<p>If I carved her face out, my family won\'t have to buy extra food for a month. That\'s how thick her skin is.</p>\n<p>Heated arguments; the dorm manager got involved; she was yelling, screaming incoherent bullshit — clearly on the defensive, which worked, since neither me nor the dorm manager could get a word in; and when she finally allowed our input she would cut into our speech about three characters in. The funniest thing was once she mentioned how I was constantly getting in fights with other dormmates, even before she shared a dorm with me — the third girl told her that! Which was funny on so many levels. She was the &quot;new kid&quot; and she dared talk about my past in front of the dorm manager, who had known me for two previous years? In addition, this was my first time sharing a dorm with the third girl too. This convinced me even more that she thinks we\'re all NPCs.</p>\n<p>For a long while, even just thinking about her made my blood boil. Fortunately, sometimes she goes home to sleep. Unfortunately, it means every night is a surprise of &quot;will she be here?&quot;</p>\n<p>Something had to change. I used to think that there\'s only one semester left, so I could roll with it; and if I quit, or moved to another dorm, it would be me losing. She\'d win, and I\'d lose. Looking back, that was <em>extremely</em> childish.</p>\n<p>But I decided to move. There was an empty spot in a dorm full of my friends, so I moved there.</p>\n<p>There were a lot of physical problems in that dorm. The door can\'t be closed properly and water keeps leaking out from mysterious places. But I am <em>happy</em>. I am with my friends!

I was in a hallway with a window at the end not unlike my school IRL, and a student came out from a classroom. The sun was rising and he hadn\'t slept the entire night. A teacher came out after him, who had also stayed up the whole night, trying to figure something out to no avail, because humans are incapable of understanding anything related to chemistry and biology.</p>\n<p>And then a UFO hit the school.</p>\n<p>And the student saw two people by the lake, one of which was the guy I was looking for. I ran down to the lake, and met them as they walked towards the building. Someone was running with me, no idea who, but we were each given something that resembled food. I was about to eat it when my dad came, took it, and threw it into the lake. He took me away, saying &quot;what was the 4th rule I taught you?&quot; I couldn\'t remember. He said, &quot;don\'t eat food given to you by strangers.&quot;</p>\n<p>We walked through a woods. He told me some thing about verification along the way, (I couldn\'t remember after waking up) and at the edge of the woods he said, &quot;it\'s north up ahead. Keep walking and you\'ll reach Beijing.&quot; I told him that it was south, and we had to turn back, <em>that</em> was north. I turned around and looked back into the woods. The apocalyptic red that was the backdrop of the entire dream up until this point was replaced by an eerie blue. I saw a policeman hiding behind a tree and peeking at me. My dad insisted that north was up ahead. I glanced at the policeman again and decided to just walk forward, realizing that he was right and that <em>was</em> indeed north.</p>\n<p>I was walking on pavement now, and heard a gun being loaded behind me. I immediately threw up my hands, blabbering about how I did nothing wrong. The policeman from the woods walked past me, staring at me like I was an idiot, and I realized that he had not been following me at all and I was just overreacting. Still, he took me through a busy street and into a police station, where we went to the second floor, and he asked me to climb down a vertical ladder leading down to the busy street we just came from.</p>\n<p>This was the second dream-within-a-dream I had. I woke up from that to me writing down the dream in my computer, but I ended up writing something about the life of a chef. And then I woke up for real.</p>\n<p>The UFO never came up a second time.

I was about to eat it when my dad came, took it, and threw it into the lake. He took me away, saying &quot;what was the 4th rule I taught you?&quot; I couldn\'t remember. He said, &quot;don\'t eat food given to you by strangers.&quot;</p>\n<p>We walked through a woods. He told me some thing about verification along the way, (I couldn\'t remember after waking up) and at the edge of the woods he said, &quot;it\'s north up ahead. Keep walking and you\'ll reach Beijing.&quot; I told him that it was south, and we had to turn back, <em>that</em> was north. I turned around and looked back into the woods. The apocalyptic red that was the backdrop of the entire dream up until this point was replaced by an eerie blue. I saw a policeman hiding behind a tree and peeking at me. My dad insisted that north was up ahead. I glanced at the policeman again and decided to just walk forward, realizing that he was right and that <em>was</em> indeed north.</p>\n<p>I was walking on pavement now, and heard a gun being loaded behind me. I immediately threw up my hands, blabbering about how I did nothing wrong. The policeman from the woods walked past me, staring at me like I was an idiot, and I realized that he had not been following me at all and I was just overreacting. Still, he took me through a busy street and into a police station, where we went to the second floor, and he asked me to climb down a vertical ladder leading down to the busy street we just came from.</p>\n<p>This was the second dream-within-a-dream I had. I woke up from that to me writing down the dream in my computer, but I ended up writing something about the life of a chef. And then I woke up for real.</p>\n<p>The UFO never came up a second time. It was a huge disk, crashing into the school grounds, and apparently nobody questioned it.</p>\n<h2 id="4" tabindex="-1">4</h2>\n<p>I was in a karaoke bar. I thought to myself, &quot;now I know how to take off my pants,&quot; because the last time I was here I didn\'t know how. Then I saw two white cats, so I scooped them up and hailed a taxi. The first driver didn\'t allow pets, so I hailed a second one. My mom was on there for some reason. We were going to find someone. The driver said, &quot;let\'s go to the graduate school he attends.&quot; Mom was surprised. &quot;He\'s already working?&quot; The driver lowered her voice and said, &quot;he\'s the first to get red-checked<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-04-21.html#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>!&quot;</p>\n<h2 id="thoughts" tabindex="-1">Thoughts</h2>\n<p>I\'ve never read too much upon how dreams reflect your inner state of mind or something, mainly because my dreams are so nonsensical, like these.

I won\'t reveal anything big.)</p>\n<p>I like spy novels, in case you haven\'t noticed. Not that I really read a lot. But my to-be-read list is strong and growing.</p>\n<p>It started in the summer of 10th grade going into 11th. We had a reading assignment for AP Language, which was to choose one book from a list. One of them was <em>The Spy and the Traitor</em> by Ben Macintyre. I was like, &quot;hey, this looks nice!&quot;</p>\n<p>It was. That was when I found out that I loved these types of stories, tales of betrayal and paranoia and stuff. I read a couple more non-fiction books by Macintyre, like <em>A Spy Among Friends</em> (about Kim Philby) and <em>Double Cross</em> (about the deception campaign before the Normandy landing — oh Garbo, the OC creator to end all OC creators), but soon moved on to fiction ones. And how could anyone read spy novels without knowing about John le Carré?</p>\n<p>I started with <em>The Spy Who Came in From the Cold</em>, which everyone recommended me to start with. It was great. I did not see it coming that twist at the end revealing how all the characters are just pawns being played around.</p>\n<p>And then I went to his first book, <em>Call for the Dead</em>. Though people didn\'t like it as much, it was pretty great too in my opinion. Started from a mystery but later turned into a spy novel. The infodump at the end could\'ve been dealt with better, though.</p>\n<p>And then I read <em>A Murder of Quality</em>, which is still Smiley but a complete mystery with no spies inside. It was a little fuzzy for me, mostly because I didn\'t get how the murder was actually carried out; and besides, if I wanted to read great British mysteries I could just go for Agatha Christie or something. Speaking of whom, I had her Tommy and Tuppence series on my list too, because I heard that the third book in the series is a spy novel. LOL.</p>\n<p>And then came the Karla Trilogy. I will never forgive myself for dumbass googling too much about <em>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</em> before I actually finished it and I GOT SPOILERED. I saw who the mole was. That was <em>not</em> fun. But even then, it was indeed a great book. Can\'t really say if I liked it any more than <em>The Spy Who</em> though, but the spoiling had something to do with that. I also watched the 2011 movie but with terminal face-blindness I keep forgetting which actor was supposed to be who.</p>\n<p><em>The Honourable<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Schoolboy</em> was great too. Though the two hours I spent getting through the first chapter only to find that the entire chapter was just a bunch of journalists going mad and flipping into the Haven to find that the Circus had left Hong Kong was torture.</p>\n<p><em>Smiley\'s People</em> wasn\'t <em>that</em> interesting in comparison. My main problem is how that guy they blackmailed (forgot his name, sorry) was a little too stupid, which watered it down a little. Still, it was a great and solid conclusion to the trilogy.</p>\n<p>And then I went back to fill the standalone ones published before. <em>The Looking Glass War</em>, published right after <em>The Spy Who</em>, if I remembered correctly, made people say &quot;oh, so he\'s the kind of author who wrote <em>one</em> good book and the rest are all bad.&quot; I think it\'s underrated though. It\'s basically <em>The Spy Who</em> with its themes amplified. I could imagine, if you asked le Carré &quot;why do you hate your job&quot; or something, he\'d say, &quot;well lemme tell you a little story&quot; and give this book to you.</p>\n<p><em>A Small Town in Germany</em> was amazing too. &quot;I\'ll chase you and you chase me and each of us will chase ourselves.&quot; (It went something like that I just recalled from memory.)</p>\n<p><em>The Little Drummer Girl</em> was the last book I read. Took me quite a while to finish, but not because it was boring. Charlie\'s motivation to spy was a little hard to understand though. My favorite part about it was first when I figured out Kurtz\'s plan after intercepting Salim at the border. Which, may or may not be explained in the book and I may or may not be right, but it looks smart. Another favorite part was how everyone seems an actor on a stage, playing different parts under different names. Charlie, who was already an actor in the first place; Joseph was Michael and Becker; Kurtz could turn into Schumann and whoever he was in front of Ned and the British police (I forgot his name).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>I\'ll be starting on <em>A Perfect Spy</em> next. I honestly can\'t rank these books because I don\'t want to put any one near the bottom.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>目前看过的勒卡雷书总：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>冷战谍魂：一个人为了能退休把自己小命豁出去了</li>\n<li>镜子战：一个人为了英国情报局丰富的想象力把自己小命豁出去了</li>\n<li>女鼓手：一群以色列人为了一个巴勒斯坦人把一个英国人的小命豁出去了（：这很以色列了）</li>\n<li>锅匠士兵裁缝间谍：史迈利被绿了后的复仇</li>\n<li>荣誉学生：一个男的为了一个女的把自己小命豁出去了</li>\n<li>史迈利的人马：一个人为了女儿把自己小命豁出去了</li>\n<li>死者来电：史迈利的自证清白之路</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Also I heard that le Carré\'s son is going to continue writing about Smiley. I hope he\'s good. <em>Angelmaker</em> is on my list, but I haven\'t gotten around to it. On one hand I\'m happy to get more books, but on the other, I\'m worried that he\'s gonna turn it into some cheesy franchise.</p>\n<p>There is, of course, the frustration that always came with someone used to reading kids books reading something from the last century. A lot of language was hard to understand, and my reading time and comprehension was greatly impacted because of that. But that\'s already way better than those 1700\'s poetry.</p>\n<p>I used to have to read in bed, or I couldn\'t even fall asleep. I\'d been on my phone more lately, which is why I haven\'t been reading as much, and why it took me so long to finish <em>The Little Drummer Girl</em>. Throughout high school, all I ever read were <em>Wings of Fire</em> and John le Carré. Required reading in class don\'t count; I only read summaries of those. I did absolutely 0 preparation for the AP Lit test, and I rested all my bets on the last essay prompt being able to fit some le Carré book. One of the past prompts I saw was about dramatic irony. Damn, <em>The Looking Glass War</em> was full of it. <em>Drummer Girl</em> too. In the actual test, the prompt was about a character losing something and how they reacted. Damn! I wrote about <em>The Spy Who</em> and how Leamas lost Riemeck<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> and Liz.</p>\n<p>The essay was downright terrible, I had no logic, and I forgot about the entire thing where Leamas hit Ford and went to jail. But it was better than the previous two. I\'m flunking the test. Whatever.</p>\n<p>I had read some books by other authors too, like <em>Our Man in Havana</em> by Graham Greene, which kind of inspired me to make a TIR story like that but in the perspective of a hapless guy targeted by whatever country\'s equivalent of the KGB. But I didn\'t have any ideas past that, so whatever. And <em>Fatherland</em> by Robert Harris, which was really neat. And there\'s the category of &quot;I have no idea what happened in them and I haven\'t gotten around to rereading it,&quot; which includes <em>The Ipcress File</em> by Len Deighton and <em>Gorky Park</em> by Martin Cruz Smith<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. And some others. Most of these definitely deserve rereading, especially <em>The Ipcress File</em> and <em>Gorky Park</em> since I read them but it was like I didn\'t at all, but I just have so many more on my list.</p>\n<p>And true to my nature I also tried to find books written for kids, because you will want to read some of those after reading something like, IDK, most of the books mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> I found <em>Spy School</em> by Stuart Gibbs, and after enjoying maybe like the first five books and reading the rest simply out of inertia (and their synopsis are really catchy. If only as much thought is put into the actual contents of the books), I found out how the author is a total piece of shit and finally set my mind to ditch it. I\'d still recommend the first book though, and only the first. I had also read some other series by the same author, mysteries rather than espionage, and they were to some extent enjoyable I guess. Still, he was pretty much ass.</p>\n<p>You\'d think I would\'ve learned to move on from middle grade books after that, but no; I shall never learn a lesson. I found this other series, <em>City Spies</em> by James Ponti, and I started on the third book just because it mentioned China (they spent most of their time in Russia though) and it actually proved to be pretty great. Way better than whatever pile of garbage <em>Spy School</em> was. So into the list the series went.</p>\n<p>(I also saw <em>Mrs. Smith\'s Spy School for Girls</em>. Gave up after one chapter. It sounds like it\'s written by a middle schooler.)</p>\n<p>There is something captivating about espionage. The feeling of worldviews being formed around lies and half-truths, the drama of betrayal, an almost artistically beautiful portrayal of paranoia, who\'s in the light and who\'s in the dark, the struggle to gain control while falling into powerlessness, and the strategy of nations battling each other in the dark.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I\'ll be back later with more books. I\'m a horrible reader and writer so I don\'t end up having a lot to say about every book, but things turn long if I review a bunch of books in one post.</p>\n<hr class="footnotes-sep" />\n<section class="footnotes">\n<ol class="footnotes-list">\n<li class="footnote-item" id="fn1"><p>LOL I spelled it in its original British spelling and Obsidian threw a spellcheck error. <a class="footnote-backref" href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li class="footnote-item" id="fn2"><p>It was also around this point I started playing Reverse 1999, and Charlie always appeared as Sonetto in my head. <a class="footnote-backref" href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li class="footnote-item" id="fn3"><p>LOL Why is Obsidian spellchecking Leamas and Riemeck?

That was <em>not</em> fun. But even then, it was indeed a great book. Can\'t really say if I liked it any more than <em>The Spy Who</em> though, but the spoiling had something to do with that. I also watched the 2011 movie but with terminal face-blindness I keep forgetting which actor was supposed to be who.</p>\n<p><em>The Honourable<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Schoolboy</em> was great too. Though the two hours I spent getting through the first chapter only to find that the entire chapter was just a bunch of journalists going mad and flipping into the Haven to find that the Circus had left Hong Kong was torture.</p>\n<p><em>Smiley\'s People</em> wasn\'t <em>that</em> interesting in comparison. My main problem is how that guy they blackmailed (forgot his name, sorry) was a little too stupid, which watered it down a little. Still, it was a great and solid conclusion to the trilogy.</p>\n<p>And then I went back to fill the standalone ones published before. <em>The Looking Glass War</em>, published right after <em>The Spy Who</em>, if I remembered correctly, made people say &quot;oh, so he\'s the kind of author who wrote <em>one</em> good book and the rest are all bad.&quot; I think it\'s underrated though. It\'s basically <em>The Spy Who</em> with its themes amplified. I could imagine, if you asked le Carré &quot;why do you hate your job&quot; or something, he\'d say, &quot;well lemme tell you a little story&quot; and give this book to you.</p>\n<p><em>A Small Town in Germany</em> was amazing too. &quot;I\'ll chase you and you chase me and each of us will chase ourselves.&quot; (It went something like that I just recalled from memory.)</p>\n<p><em>The Little Drummer Girl</em> was the last book I read. Took me quite a while to finish, but not because it was boring. Charlie\'s motivation to spy was a little hard to understand though. My favorite part about it was first when I figured out Kurtz\'s plan after intercepting Salim at the border. Which, may or may not be explained in the book and I may or may not be right, but it looks smart. Another favorite part was how everyone seems an actor on a stage, playing different parts under different names. Charlie, who was already an actor in the first place; Joseph was Michael and Becker; Kurtz could turn into Schumann and whoever he was in front of Ned and the British police (I forgot his name).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>I\'ll be starting on <em>A Perfect Spy</em> next. I honestly can\'t rank these books because I don\'t want to put any one near the bottom.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>目前看过的勒卡雷书总：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>冷战谍魂：一个人为了能退休把自己小命豁出去了</li>\n<li>镜子战：一个人为了英国情报局丰富的想象力把自己小命豁出去了</li>\n<li>女鼓手：一群以色列人为了一个巴勒斯坦人把一个英国人的小命豁出去了（：这很以色列了）</li>\n<li>锅匠士兵裁缝间谍：史迈利被绿了后的复仇</li>\n<li>荣誉学生：一个男的为了一个女的把自己小命豁出去了</li>\n<li>史迈利的人马：一个人为了女儿把自己小命豁出去了</li>\n<li>死者来电：史迈利的自证清白之路</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Also I heard that le Carré\'s son is going to continue writing about Smiley. I hope he\'s good. <em>Angelmaker</em> is on my list, but I haven\'t gotten around to it. On one hand I\'m happy to get more books, but on the other, I\'m worried that he\'s gonna turn it into some cheesy franchise.</p>\n<p>There is, of course, the frustration that always came with someone used to reading kids books reading something from the last century. A lot of language was hard to understand, and my reading time and comprehension was greatly impacted because of that. But that\'s already way better than those 1700\'s poetry.</p>\n<p>I used to have to read in bed, or I couldn\'t even fall asleep. I\'d been on my phone more lately, which is why I haven\'t been reading as much, and why it took me so long to finish <em>The Little Drummer Girl</em>. Throughout high school, all I ever read were <em>Wings of Fire</em> and John le Carré. Required reading in class don\'t count; I only read summaries of those. I did absolutely 0 preparation for the AP Lit test, and I rested all my bets on the last essay prompt being able to fit some le Carré book. One of the past prompts I saw was about dramatic irony. Damn, <em>The Looking Glass War</em> was full of it. <em>Drummer Girl</em> too. In the actual test, the prompt was about a character losing something and how they reacted. Damn! I wrote about <em>The Spy Who</em> and how Leamas lost Riemeck<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> and Liz.</p>\n<p>The essay was downright terrible, I had no logic, and I forgot about the entire thing where Leamas hit Ford and went to jail. But it was better than the previous two. I\'m flunking the test. Whatever.</p>\n<p>I had read some books by other authors too, like <em>Our Man in Havana</em> by Graham Greene, which kind of inspired me to make a TIR story like that but in the perspective of a hapless guy targeted by whatever country\'s equivalent of the KGB. But I didn\'t have any ideas past that, so whatever. And <em>Fatherland</em> by Robert Harris, which was really neat. And there\'s the category of &quot;I have no idea what happened in them and I haven\'t gotten around to rereading it,&quot; which includes <em>The Ipcress File</em> by Len Deighton and <em>Gorky Park</em> by Martin Cruz Smith<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. And some others. Most of these definitely deserve rereading, especially <em>The Ipcress File</em> and <em>Gorky Park</em> since I read them but it was like I didn\'t at all, but I just have so many more on my list.</p>\n<p>And true to my nature I also tried to find books written for kids, because you will want to read some of those after reading something like, IDK, most of the books mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> I found <em>Spy School</em> by Stuart Gibbs, and after enjoying maybe like the first five books and reading the rest simply out of inertia (and their synopsis are really catchy. If only as much thought is put into the actual contents of the books), I found out how the author is a total piece of shit and finally set my mind to ditch it. I\'d still recommend the first book though, and only the first. I had also read some other series by the same author, mysteries rather than espionage, and they were to some extent enjoyable I guess. Still, he was pretty much ass.</p>\n<p>You\'d think I would\'ve learned to move on from middle grade books after that, but no; I shall never learn a lesson. I found this other series, <em>City Spies</em> by James Ponti, and I started on the third book just because it mentioned China (they spent most of their time in Russia though) and it actually proved to be pretty great. Way better than whatever pile of garbage <em>Spy School</em> was. So into the list the series went.</p>\n<p>(I also saw <em>Mrs. Smith\'s Spy School for Girls</em>. Gave up after one chapter. It sounds like it\'s written by a middle schooler.)</p>\n<p>There is something captivating about espionage. The feeling of worldviews being formed around lies and half-truths, the drama of betrayal, an almost artistically beautiful portrayal of paranoia, who\'s in the light and who\'s in the dark, the struggle to gain control while falling into powerlessness, and the strategy of nations battling each other in the dark.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I\'ll be back later with more books. I\'m a horrible reader and writer so I don\'t end up having a lot to say about every book, but things turn long if I review a bunch of books in one post.</p>\n<hr class="footnotes-sep" />\n<section class="footnotes">\n<ol class="footnotes-list">\n<li class="footnote-item" id="fn1"><p>LOL I spelled it in its original British spelling and Obsidian threw a spellcheck error. <a class="footnote-backref" href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li class="footnote-item" id="fn2"><p>It was also around this point I started playing Reverse 1999, and Charlie always appeared as Sonetto in my head. <a class="footnote-backref" href="https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-05-19.html#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li class="footnote-item" id="fn3"><p>LOL Why is Obsidian spellchecking Leamas and Riemeck?

In addition, nearly all of them are orally passed down and inconsistencies may appear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A long, long time ago, the ancestor of the Mosuo people Luyiruo and his little brother lived a peaceful life of farming. They didn\'t know that a disaster would soon come.</p>\n<p>The brothers were farming as usual when a crow circled above their heads, cawing. Luyiruo\'s little brother was heartless; he grabbed a fistful of dirt and threw it at the crow, thinking that its cawing meant bad luck. Luyiruo, however, was very caring. He didn\'t chase the crow away, but instead asked it what it wanted to say.</p>\n<p>The crow told them, &quot;a flood is coming, one that will wipe out all life on land. You need to be prepared. Slaughter two sheep, make sacks from their skins, tie them to a tree, and hide inside. That\'s the only way you can survive.&quot;</p>\n<p>The crow instructed the little brother to sew his sack with a thick needle and thin thread, and to tie it to the trunk of the tree; while it instructed Luyiruo to sew his with a thin needle and thick thread, and to tie it to the tip of the tree.</p>\n<p>The brothers did as the crow told them. The flood came. It drowned over the little brother\'s sack first, and the water leaked inside; he drowned soon after, paying for his heartless actions. Luyiruo\'s waterproof sack floated above the water; he survived because of his kindness. After a long time, the flood ceased, and Luyiruo got out of his sheep skin sack. When he landed on the ground, the vast plains were devoid of life. He was the only one left.</p>\n<p>A lonely life was miserable. Luyiruo prayed to gods all the time, praying for a partner who could sing and dance with him. So the Sky God sent down the God of Life, Abado. Abado came with a rhododendron branch, carved it into a little person and gave it to Luyiruo, saying, &quot;bury this in the soil. Seven years later, it will grow into a partner who can sing and dance with you.&quot; Rhododendrons are sacred trees, and this is why the Mosuo use them in rituals. Luyiruo heard &quot;seven years,&quot; knelt down and begged it to be faster, or he would die of loneliness. Abado agreed, and changed it to seven months — but not a minute less, because all good things need time.</p>\n<p>Luyiruo buried the little wooden figure into the soil and waited around it every day. On the seventh day, he couldn\'t wait any longer, and dug the figure out to see how it was growing. The figure could move its toes and chin now, but it was far from a real human. Luyiruo got mad. &quot;You will never actually turn into someone who could sing and dance with me!&quot; With that, he threw it far away.</p>\n<p>Luyiruo\'s actions had enraged Abado, so he couldn\'t rely on them anymore. He had to seek new options. He decided that he would find someone from the sky. With great effort, this brave human being arrived at the Sky Kingdom. He reached a well, and, being so tired, sat down to have a drink. Just then, the Eldest Sky Daughter came to get water, and ran into him. Her eyes were vertical, and she was brilliantly smart. The Eldest Sky Daughter asked him where he came from and what he wanted to do. He answered honestly. The Sky Daughter was so happy, because she always thought that the ground was better than the sky, where everything was really boring. She saw her opportunity to go live on the land, and agreed enthusiastically to help Luyiruo out.</p>\n<p>The Eldest Sky Daughter knew that her father would not let Luyiruo have it easy, so she went back first and stole the ring on her father\'s thumb and had Luyiruo put it on.</p>\n<p>The Sky God got the message that someone wanted to marry one of his daughters. He thought that this person must be brave, and decided to test him. He called the man forth, and set a tiger on him. The tiger saw one of the Sky God\'s belongings on Luyiruo, and backed down. The Sky God then let the leopard out, who also backed down. The Sky God set all of the most vicious animals on Luyiruo, but they all scattered away. The Sky God realized that Luyiruo was no ordinary man.</p>\n<p>The second day, the Sky God said to Luyiruo, &quot;so you want to marry one of my daughters to sing and dance with you? That\'s okay, but you have to pass all my tests first. Go cut down all the trees on the mountain!&quot; Luyiruo went to the mountain, but he only cut down three trees before collapsing. The Eldest Sky Daughter came to his aid. She told him, &quot;start from the bottom, and slice one mark into each tree. Finally, just cut down the tree at the top.&quot; Luyiruo did as she said. When the topmost tree fell, all the other trees fell one by one.</p>\n<p>The Sky God then ordered him to burn down the mountain so crops can be planted. Luyiruo spent a lot of time lighting just three fires. When he was complaining about how hard it was, the Eldest Sky Daughter came to his aid again. &quot;It\'s not hard,&quot; she said, &quot;pile up the wood first, and light up the pile at the bottom.&quot; Luyiruo did as she said. When the bottommost fire was lit, the fire burned all the way to the top. Soon, the entire mountain was cleared out.</p>\n<p>Then, the Sky God ordered him to plant buckwheat. He gave him three <em>sheng</em> of buckwheat, and told him to grow thirty-three <em>dan</em> from it. The mountain was so big, how could he plant all of those seeds and harvest thirty-three <em>dan</em>? Luyiruo was stuck again. The Sky Daughter appeared again and taught him a spell. Luyiruo chanted the spell while scattering the seeds, and soon all the seeds were planted. The buckwheat was ready for harvest. Luyiruo took all thirty-three <em>dan</em> to the Sky God, but he insisted that a little bit was missing. The Eldest Sky Daughter told him that the Sky God sent a pigeon and ate a little bit. He had to kill the pigeon to get it back. She gave him a bow and some arrows from the Sky Kingdom. Luyiruo was worried that he would miss. He stood near the Sky Daughter\'s loom and hesitated to shoot. The Sky Daughter panicked and threw the shuttle his way, hitting his arm and letting the arrow loose. It hit the pigeon. Luyiruo got the remaining buckwheat from inside the pigeon\'s belly.</p>\n<p>The Sky God was difficult. He set up more tests for Luyiruo. This time, he had to get some tiger milk. Who dared get near the vicious tiger? Luyiruo was troubled, but he still decided to carry on. In a shrub, he saw a weasel with cubs, and got some weasel milk to fool the Sky God. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. No other animal reacted, but all the chicken ran away. Now the Sky God knew Luyiruo was trying to fool him with weasel milk, and ordered him to go looking again.</p>\n<p>This time, he met a wolf with cubs. He took back some wolf milk. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. This time, no other animal reacted, but all the pigs ran away. Now the Sky God knew Luyiruo was trying to fool him with wolf milk, and ordered him to go looking again.</p>\n<p>The third time, he met a leopard with cubs. He took back some leopard milk. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. This time, no other animal reacted, but all the horses ran away. Now the Sky God knew Luyiruo was trying to fool him with leopard milk, and told him that if he couldn\'t get tiger milk next time, he would have to go home.</p>\n<p>At this crucial moment, the Eldest Sky Daughter appeared again. She told him, &quot;the tiger\'s nest is under the rocks at the mountaintop. When it\'s snowing, the mother will go out to hunt. You need to kill a tiger cub, wear its pelt, and play with the other cubs. Act like them as much as possible, and when the mother comes back, you can get tiger milk.&quot; She also gave him a pig\'s bladder to put the milk in. Luyiruo did as she said, and successfully brought back tiger milk. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. This time, every animal ran away. Luyiruo\'s tests were finally complete, and he can now take a Sky Daughter home.</p>\n<p>The Sky God turned his daughters into vicious animals and had them run towards Luyiruo. Whoever he could catch would be the one to sing and dance with him.</p>\n<p>The Eldest Sky Daughter turned into a tiger and ran out. Luyiruo freaked out and failed to catch her. She helped him this whole way, but it ended like this; what a great pity. The Second Sky Daughter turned into a leopard and leapt out. Luyiruo was still scared, and failed to catch her. The Youngest Sky Daughter turned into a boa and flew at him. Luyiruo thought, <em>this is my last chance</em>, and closed his eyes, reaching out, grabbing hold of the boa\'s tail. The boa turned back into the Youngest Sky Daughter. Her eyes were horizontal like ours, because we\'re descended from her. People often said that if Luyiruo married the vertical-eyed Eldest, we would be a lot smarter, and could live life a lot easier. But it was the Sky\'s will that we shall struggle to live.</p>\n<p>Just like that, Luyiruo found a partner and went back to the land to live. The Sky God gave many gifts to them, like grains, plants, and farm animals. Originally, the Sky God didn\'t give us the cat, but it snuck down and helped us catch mice, so we treat cats like gods too. The Sky God also didn\'t give us delicious oatmeal, but the Youngest Sky Daughter hid some in her pubes. This is why we don\'t use oatmeal in rituals.</p>\n<p>Before they left, the Sky God reminded them, &quot;no matter how much land you have, it will be rife with weeds if no one takes care of it; no matter how many animals you have, they will be hunted and die if no one guards them; no matter how big your house is, it will be destroyed by wind and rain if no one maintains it.&quot; Luyiruo learnt the words of his father-in-law by heart and returned to the land.</p>\n<p>The couple planted crops and fed animals, living a life full of hope. The land was full of life.</p>\n<p>The Eldest Sky Daughter was sad and jealous because she didn\'t fulfil her own wishes. She came down to the land to get revenge on her little sister and her husband. They had planted a large swathe of barley in front of their home. The Eldest Sky Daughter turned into a deer and ate all the barley. The Youngest knew it was her big sister\'s doing, and ordered Luyiruo to get out his bow and arrows and shoot the deer. Luyiruo didn\'t want to do so, and the Youngest did it herself. She tucked her dress onto her waist and ran outside with the bow. Luyiruo, not wanting to hurt the Eldest, snatched the bow and shot, purposefully only hitting a hoof. The deer ran away, leaving a trail of blood. Luyiruo chased after her. The Eldest lured Luyiruo far away, mountain after mountain, until they reached a spring. She revealed her true form, said farewell, and tricked Luyiruo into drinking the spring water, which made him fall into a deep sleep. Only then did the Eldest leave them be and return to the sky.</p>\n<p>The Youngest was waiting for Luyiruo back home. She waited for years. There was a monkey on the mountain who wanted to marry the Youngest Sky Daughter. He saw his chance and came to her, saying he could help her find Luyiruo, but he didn\'t have shoes. She made him a pair of grass shoes, but he only took a few steps before it wore down and he returned. She made him another pair with iron. The monkey scrubbed it against a rock until it wore down too, and he returned again. The Youngest Sky Daughter was dejected, and simply decided to just marry the monkey. They had a lot of little monkeys.</p>\n<p>Decades passed with Luyiruo sleeping by the spring. An autumn frost woke him. He drank some water from the spring, and saw in the reflection that his hair had gone gray. He walked home on a crotch, and seeing the monkey there, he got mad and killed the monkey. The little monkeys are the Youngest Sky Daughter\'s children, so he kept them. But he thought all the fur on the monkeys were ugly, so he boiled a pot of water and burned the fur off them. The little monkeys covered their heads and ran, so the fur on their heads, armpits, and pubic areas was untouched, which is why we grow fur on these places.</p>\n<p>From now on, Luyiruo and the Youngest Sky Daughter lived together peacefully. They worked, sang, danced.</p>\n<p>But there was a problem. Everyone was immortal; no one would die. Pretty soon, the land was overcrowded. The Sky God thought that all life should both start and end. He sent the God of Life, Abado, to assign an age to all life.</p>\n<p>Abado came down to land again. They first gave all plants an age, and moved on to the animals. He secretly sent a dream to Luyiruo to listen close and claim a long age for humans. But he overslept.</p>\n<p>Abado yelled, &quot;a thousand!&quot; The alert crane answered their call, so the crane got the longest age. Abado then yelled, &quot;a hundred!&quot; The aware duck answered their call, and got a hundred years, went away shaking its duck butt. Abado went on assigning ages while Luyiruo was still sleeping at home. When they reached sixty, the smart dog answered, and got sixty years. They got all the way to thirteen when Luyiruo snapped awake and hastily answered. This is how humans were doomed to die at thirteen because we liked sleeping too much. Luyiruo turned to walk home sadly.</p>\n<p>Abado chased after him and told him, &quot;why don\'t you talk to the dog? They\'re the closest animals to humans. Maybe you can trade!&quot; Luyiruo thought, <em>true. Ever since I came back with the Youngest Sky Daughter, the dog had followed loyally by my side. It guarded my home and animals, kept the elderly in company, and gave the young joy. Surely, it will agree?</em> So he said goodbye to Abado, found the dog, and asked to trade ages with it. The dog thought, <em>even though I spent a lot of effort getting these sixty years, I rely on humans a lot.</em> It agreed, but under these three conditions: first, humans must never harm dogs; second, during holidays, after rituals, humans have to feed the dogs first before they can start; third, when dogs die, they have to be buried in the yard with a sack of bones. Luyiruo agreed to these conditions with gratitude. He thought about another animal equally loyal to humans — the cat, who snuck down from the sky to help humans, so he added cats to the same conditions.</p>\n<p>From now on, humans can live to sixty years. This is also why the Mosuo hold their adulting ceremony at thirteen years old, because the new life that dogs gave us have started.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You notice how the Second Sky Daughter only appeared once?

She saw her opportunity to go live on the land, and agreed enthusiastically to help Luyiruo out.</p>\n<p>The Eldest Sky Daughter knew that her father would not let Luyiruo have it easy, so she went back first and stole the ring on her father\'s thumb and had Luyiruo put it on.</p>\n<p>The Sky God got the message that someone wanted to marry one of his daughters. He thought that this person must be brave, and decided to test him. He called the man forth, and set a tiger on him. The tiger saw one of the Sky God\'s belongings on Luyiruo, and backed down. The Sky God then let the leopard out, who also backed down. The Sky God set all of the most vicious animals on Luyiruo, but they all scattered away. The Sky God realized that Luyiruo was no ordinary man.</p>\n<p>The second day, the Sky God said to Luyiruo, &quot;so you want to marry one of my daughters to sing and dance with you? That\'s okay, but you have to pass all my tests first. Go cut down all the trees on the mountain!&quot; Luyiruo went to the mountain, but he only cut down three trees before collapsing. The Eldest Sky Daughter came to his aid. She told him, &quot;start from the bottom, and slice one mark into each tree. Finally, just cut down the tree at the top.&quot; Luyiruo did as she said. When the topmost tree fell, all the other trees fell one by one.</p>\n<p>The Sky God then ordered him to burn down the mountain so crops can be planted. Luyiruo spent a lot of time lighting just three fires. When he was complaining about how hard it was, the Eldest Sky Daughter came to his aid again. &quot;It\'s not hard,&quot; she said, &quot;pile up the wood first, and light up the pile at the bottom.&quot; Luyiruo did as she said. When the bottommost fire was lit, the fire burned all the way to the top. Soon, the entire mountain was cleared out.</p>\n<p>Then, the Sky God ordered him to plant buckwheat. He gave him three <em>sheng</em> of buckwheat, and told him to grow thirty-three <em>dan</em> from it. The mountain was so big, how could he plant all of those seeds and harvest thirty-three <em>dan</em>? Luyiruo was stuck again. The Sky Daughter appeared again and taught him a spell. Luyiruo chanted the spell while scattering the seeds, and soon all the seeds were planted. The buckwheat was ready for harvest. Luyiruo took all thirty-three <em>dan</em> to the Sky God, but he insisted that a little bit was missing. The Eldest Sky Daughter told him that the Sky God sent a pigeon and ate a little bit. He had to kill the pigeon to get it back. She gave him a bow and some arrows from the Sky Kingdom. Luyiruo was worried that he would miss. He stood near the Sky Daughter\'s loom and hesitated to shoot. The Sky Daughter panicked and threw the shuttle his way, hitting his arm and letting the arrow loose. It hit the pigeon. Luyiruo got the remaining buckwheat from inside the pigeon\'s belly.</p>\n<p>The Sky God was difficult. He set up more tests for Luyiruo. This time, he had to get some tiger milk. Who dared get near the vicious tiger? Luyiruo was troubled, but he still decided to carry on. In a shrub, he saw a weasel with cubs, and got some weasel milk to fool the Sky God. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. No other animal reacted, but all the chicken ran away. Now the Sky God knew Luyiruo was trying to fool him with weasel milk, and ordered him to go looking again.</p>\n<p>This time, he met a wolf with cubs. He took back some wolf milk. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. This time, no other animal reacted, but all the pigs ran away. Now the Sky God knew Luyiruo was trying to fool him with wolf milk, and ordered him to go looking again.</p>\n<p>The third time, he met a leopard with cubs. He took back some leopard milk. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. This time, no other animal reacted, but all the horses ran away. Now the Sky God knew Luyiruo was trying to fool him with leopard milk, and told him that if he couldn\'t get tiger milk next time, he would have to go home.</p>\n<p>At this crucial moment, the Eldest Sky Daughter appeared again. She told him, &quot;the tiger\'s nest is under the rocks at the mountaintop. When it\'s snowing, the mother will go out to hunt. You need to kill a tiger cub, wear its pelt, and play with the other cubs. Act like them as much as possible, and when the mother comes back, you can get tiger milk.&quot; She also gave him a pig\'s bladder to put the milk in. Luyiruo did as she said, and successfully brought back tiger milk. The Sky God poured the milk in front of some farm animals. This time, every animal ran away. Luyiruo\'s tests were finally complete, and he can now take a Sky Daughter home.</p>\n<p>The Sky God turned his daughters into vicious animals and had them run towards Luyiruo. Whoever he could catch would be the one to sing and dance with him.</p>\n<p>The Eldest Sky Daughter turned into a tiger and ran out. Luyiruo freaked out and failed to catch her. She helped him this whole way, but it ended like this; what a great pity. The Second Sky Daughter turned into a leopard and leapt out. Luyiruo was still scared, and failed to catch her. The Youngest Sky Daughter turned into a boa and flew at him. Luyiruo thought, <em>this is my last chance</em>, and closed his eyes, reaching out, grabbing hold of the boa\'s tail. The boa turned back into the Youngest Sky Daughter. Her eyes were horizontal like ours, because we\'re descended from her. People often said that if Luyiruo married the vertical-eyed Eldest, we would be a lot smarter, and could live life a lot easier. But it was the Sky\'s will that we shall struggle to live.</p>\n<p>Just like that, Luyiruo found a partner and went back to the land to live. The Sky God gave many gifts to them, like grains, plants, and farm animals. Originally, the Sky God didn\'t give us the cat, but it snuck down and helped us catch mice, so we treat cats like gods too. The Sky God also didn\'t give us delicious oatmeal, but the Youngest Sky Daughter hid some in her pubes. This is why we don\'t use oatmeal in rituals.</p>\n<p>Before they left, the Sky God reminded them, &quot;no matter how much land you have, it will be rife with weeds if no one takes care of it; no matter how many animals you have, they will be hunted and die if no one guards them; no matter how big your house is, it will be destroyed by wind and rain if no one maintains it.&quot; Luyiruo learnt the words of his father-in-law by heart and returned to the land.</p>\n<p>The couple planted crops and fed animals, living a life full of hope. The land was full of life.</p>\n<p>The Eldest Sky Daughter was sad and jealous because she didn\'t fulfil her own wishes. She came down to the land to get revenge on her little sister and her husband. They had planted a large swathe of barley in front of their home. The Eldest Sky Daughter turned into a deer and ate all the barley. The Youngest knew it was her big sister\'s doing, and ordered Luyiruo to get out his bow and arrows and shoot the deer. Luyiruo didn\'t want to do so, and the Youngest did it herself. She tucked her dress onto her waist and ran outside with the bow. Luyiruo, not wanting to hurt the Eldest, snatched the bow and shot, purposefully only hitting a hoof. The deer ran away, leaving a trail of blood. Luyiruo chased after her. The Eldest lured Luyiruo far away, mountain after mountain, until they reached a spring. She revealed her true form, said farewell, and tricked Luyiruo into drinking the spring water, which made him fall into a deep sleep. Only then did the Eldest leave them be and return to the sky.</p>\n<p>The Youngest was waiting for Luyiruo back home. She waited for years. There was a monkey on the mountain who wanted to marry the Youngest Sky Daughter. He saw his chance and came to her, saying he could help her find Luyiruo, but he didn\'t have shoes. She made him a pair of grass shoes, but he only took a few steps before it wore down and he returned. She made him another pair with iron. The monkey scrubbed it against a rock until it wore down too, and he returned again. The Youngest Sky Daughter was dejected, and simply decided to just marry the monkey. They had a lot of little monkeys.</p>\n<p>Decades passed with Luyiruo sleeping by the spring. An autumn frost woke him. He drank some water from the spring, and saw in the reflection that his hair had gone gray. He walked home on a crotch, and seeing the monkey there, he got mad and killed the monkey. The little monkeys are the Youngest Sky Daughter\'s children, so he kept them. But he thought all the fur on the monkeys were ugly, so he boiled a pot of water and burned the fur off them. The little monkeys covered their heads and ran, so the fur on their heads, armpits, and pubic areas was untouched, which is why we grow fur on these places.</p>\n<p>From now on, Luyiruo and the Youngest Sky Daughter lived together peacefully. They worked, sang, danced.</p>\n<p>But there was a problem. Everyone was immortal; no one would die. Pretty soon, the land was overcrowded. The Sky God thought that all life should both start and end. He sent the God of Life, Abado, to assign an age to all life.</p>\n<p>Abado came down to land again. They first gave all plants an age, and moved on to the animals. He secretly sent a dream to Luyiruo to listen close and claim a long age for humans. But he overslept.</p>\n<p>Abado yelled, &quot;a thousand!&quot; The alert crane answered their call, so the crane got the longest age. Abado then yelled, &quot;a hundred!&quot; The aware duck answered their call, and got a hundred years, went away shaking its duck butt. Abado went on assigning ages while Luyiruo was still sleeping at home. When they reached sixty, the smart dog answered, and got sixty years. They got all the way to thirteen when Luyiruo snapped awake and hastily answered. This is how humans were doomed to die at thirteen because we liked sleeping too much. Luyiruo turned to walk home sadly.</p>\n<p>Abado chased after him and told him, &quot;why don\'t you talk to the dog? They\'re the closest animals to humans. Maybe you can trade!&quot; Luyiruo thought, <em>true. Ever since I came back with the Youngest Sky Daughter, the dog had followed loyally by my side. It guarded my home and animals, kept the elderly in company, and gave the young joy. Surely, it will agree?</em> So he said goodbye to Abado, found the dog, and asked to trade ages with it. The dog thought, <em>even though I spent a lot of effort getting these sixty years, I rely on humans a lot.</em> It agreed, but under these three conditions: first, humans must never harm dogs; second, during holidays, after rituals, humans have to feed the dogs first before they can start; third, when dogs die, they have to be buried in the yard with a sack of bones. Luyiruo agreed to these conditions with gratitude. He thought about another animal equally loyal to humans — the cat, who snuck down from the sky to help humans, so he added cats to the same conditions.</p>\n<p>From now on, humans can live to sixty years. This is also why the Mosuo hold their adulting ceremony at thirteen years old, because the new life that dogs gave us have started.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You notice how the Second Sky Daughter only appeared once? The second child syndrome is truly a staple of humanity LOL.</p>'}
