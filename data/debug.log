Having been playing with &#8216;v4.5+&#8217; beta model before the release, which I have to imagine is essentially the training set for v5, I&#8217;d be lying if I said I noted a significant difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Possibly</em> Suno is a little better at following the in-line lyric style and instrumentation guides given, but hard to be sure given the variances you can get in generation to generation even against the same exact prompts, guides, and &#8216;advanced settings&#8217;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gained access to <a href="https://suno.com/studio-welcome">Suno Studio</a> this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65692" height="517" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-940x517.png" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> RIP free time.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked with Studio on a few songs now, it definitely has a lot of potential, but for my use case and at least currently, carries an equally high number of frustrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of them coming from the fact that &#8216;stem&#8217; extraction is fairly hit and miss, and can introduce sound artifacts that didn&#8217;t exist in the original generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When all I&#8217;m wanting to achieve is to tweak the per-instrument positioning on the sound stage, it&#8217;s fairly irksome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those using it in probably the more &#8216;proper&#8217; fashion, and creating elements from the ground up, I have to imagine it&#8217;s already quite the power house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, moving on to actual games!

Good enough, anyway, that I pre-ordered the third book for Kindle and wish that I&#8217;d waited a little longer before this particular spot of curiosity struck, as there is going to be a lot of waiting to see this series unfold!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Dan Willis&#8217; <em>Arcane Casebook</em> series to fill the gap. I&#8217;m through two of the five books in the bundle I bought already, and I can tell I&#8217;ll be getting the rest. It&#8217;s a bit of an interesting spin on the genre, too, being set in &#8216;Depression era&#8217; New York, but where magic of various forms has taken the place of certain aspects of technology developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m torn on having Goodreads count it as a single book though.

Finding music that resonates with the soul, or at least the big feelings of the moment, is cathartic in a way almost nothing else can be.

You may&#8217;ve heard of it &#8212; but if not, it&#8217;s an AI that can create songs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d heard of it before. But honestly? I had simply assumed it&#8217;d be little more than a toy. Somewhere along the line I got the idea you had to provide your own vocals, and the AI just acted like a souped-up auto-tune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>can</em> use it like that, sure. But you can also simply write your own lyrics and have it go at it. Heck &#8212; if you&#8217;d rather, you don&#8217;t even need to do that.

I could not have expended any less effort on it if I <em>tried</em>. I can&#8217;t even recall what my prompt was, but I know I didn&#8217;t even bother prompting for specific styles. I just wasn&#8217;t invested yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it made me sit up and pay attention because I couldn&#8217;t hand on heart tell you I&#8217;d definitely have identified it as AI-generated if I hadn&#8217;t just clicked the &#8216;Create&#8217; button myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thus Starts my Crash Course in Song Construction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I <em>like</em> music, I couldn&#8217;t have told you a few days ago what a &#8216;prechorus&#8217; was (beyond the obvious), or what precisely a &#8216;bridge&#8217; is meant to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of this learning was just feeding in basic prompts and seeing what came out, but I also took a bit of a stab at seeing if I knew enough to take inspiration from other, much better, songs and seeing if Suno could get me anywhere close. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was even reading song and album reviews for crying out loud. It was a bit like learning a new language adjacent to, but not quite the same as the one you&#8217;re native to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/jJSVX5qAs2KcYbK6">What Never Relents</a></em> is one such attempt, where I was looking to see if I could craft a style prompt to hit a similar feel to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUe9UhcUtEI">Specter by Bad Omens</a></em>. It does tickle me that the generated lyrics here used &#8216;Specter&#8217; without specifically being prompted to or given the lyric directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not an unqualified success (particularly not on the vocal stylings), I was, once again, somewhat impressed.

Don’t ask me how or why &#8212; I couldn’t tell you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I do know is that I realised I’d still been treating Suno as a toy, when it was clearly more than that. So… I did something I haven’t done in <em>many</em> years.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-2-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65184" title="Probably not since I was that rock-bashing cave-teen myself."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote something like poetry — only this time, I had a way to give it a soundtrack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we call those songs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because she’d been on my mind a lot lately, I wrote one about my mother. Let me tell you &#8212; I was <em>not</em> ready to hear the words sung back at me. Jesus H. Christ. I&#8217;m uncertain what context to give. Perhaps none, and leave it to what I&#8217;ve already <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/goodbye-mum/">said in the past</a>. Songs are meant to speak for themselves anyway, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hit me harder than I expected. Harder than I was ready for. And yet, I kept working on it. It took a fair bit of finessing of lyrics and style guides to get where I wanted it &#8212; and Suno really does not like being told what to do if you introduce the concept of a second voice &#8212; but I ultimately found my way to this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/zQ6jTxGIw1ClJRnT">The Weight of Love</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s still a sombre piece overall, the more I tweaked, the more small notes of light started slipping in. Verse 3, for example, wasn’t in the first draft at all &#8212; it only emerged as I kept writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, for starters, I think I finally get why some albums feel like they’re circling one idea over and over. Apparently, when something matters, you don’t just&#8230; wring it out in a single track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So of course I had to do another. I had more work through here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just like that, I think I&#8217;m on the path to just creating a whole (virtual) album. Whodathunk? Certainly not me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not blind to the issues such AI technologies pose, whichever side of the fence you sit on. I can&#8217;t say I know how ethically the models have been trained (but&#8230; I could guess). Nor do I relish a future where the world is drowning in &#8216;AI Slop&#8217; in the music field as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the transition of considering Suno from Toy to Therapist is perhaps telling of my perspective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to spell it out; I don’t think anything I make with it should soar to the top of the charts, or replace the work of genuinely talented artists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as something personal — a way to process, to experiment, to speak feelings I’d struggle to put into words otherwise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s powerful stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first cave-teenager banged rocks together to make sense of big feelings. I guess I’m doing the same, only now the rocks have been swapped for an algorithm and a pair of headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bonus Track</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/hjZv4nd55jkbFif0">Remember Me (That Way)</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second (made, but maybe not in final placement) track from this hypothetical album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honouring Mum&#8217;s request for how she wished to be remembered &#8212; but without burying the truth for those left behind, either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a trickier one to land, asking Suno to balance minor and major sections to hit the right overall tone. Last night I was <em>just about</em> ready to come to the conclusion Suno simply couldn&#8217;t do it. After changing my approach to the in-lyric style notes and the main style guide, here we go!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/">Accidentally, Songs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com">Time to Loot</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'post-id': '65184'}

It no longer asked the reader to think through implications and parallels for themselves and instead became a mallet to the face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strength of fiction, done well, is that whole stimulation of thought. Creating (or perhaps more accurately, finding) the links for yourself.

It&#8217;s the <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/youd-never-guess-but/">plan</a> anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/other-games/screenshot-saturday-deadzone-rogue/">Last week</a>, I did Deadzone: Rogue; so I probably won&#8217;t do that one again. Beyond that though the decision gets a fair bit trickier. Both FFXIV and Wuthering Waves are doing their darndest to be the one. Wuthering Waves had its 2.6 patch this week, with a character banner I was actually interested in<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-3-65003"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/wuthering-waves/screenshot-saturday-wuthering-waves-2-6-edition/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-65003" title="I haven&amp;#8217;t gone for anyone since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D9K2rz3Uvk&quot;&gt;Cartethyia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=optr9r9VkoQ&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;)"><sup>3</sup></a></span> and what looks to be a finale-feeling storyline for the Rinascita story arc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Although it is possible, actually, that this trailer is representing more than just 2.6. Perhaps a 2.7 is in our future to close out Rinascita. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know yet because I haven&#8217;t actually <em>started</em> the 2.6 Main Story Quest yet, let alone finished it. Actually- that&#8217;s not 100% true. I have done the preamble/character introduction bits, but then paused just shy of getting started <em>properly</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead I&#8217;ve caught up on the Overture quest from 2.5, which, come to think of it, is pretty similar in nature to the between-expansion quest lines of FFXIV. Just&#8230; <em>much</em> shorter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; Alright, I&#8217;ve gone on this long. I was going to outline the case for FFXIV before deciding, but perhaps that can just occupy next week&#8217;s slot! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-columns wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65007" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250828220450_2-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Won Augusta 1st night of the patch!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65008" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250830020819_1-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Did <em>not</em> win weapon first night.

I had things to do. &#8230; Thing to do. <em>Alright, geez,</em> I had a game to play. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have our own motivations, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonight I don&#8217;t have quite the same need. I made it through the end of Heavensward, hit credits (<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/final-fantasy-xiv/rolling-credits-on-heavensward/">again</a>), and got the Stormblood title drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-64967" height="529" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250827233112_1-940x529.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV:</em></strong> Passing the Wall, into all new lands.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, I lied, I do have the same need. I want to play more. The start of Stormblood is great so far. Plus! I now know who the lady in red in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt1h1MinlLI">Stormblood trailer</a> is! All these years, and I just assumed she was a class trainer from the expansion. Eesh!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. I&#8217;m getting distracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; If focus is the key, I might be in trouble. ! <em>Althooough</em>, I got distracted <em>while</em> writing this time. So I&#8217;m going to call that progress. Surely it&#8217;s better than stopping mid-post to reply in Discord or Google some random thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I think it might be actually, is channelling that&#8230; <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/writing-comments-vs-posts/">comment writing energy</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The linked post goes into more detail, but as a brief recap if you haven&#8217;t the foggiest what I mean&#8230; Something that&#8217;s true for me, and others, and maybe you&#8217;ll recognise it as well after I explain it, is that writing a post&#8230; Man, that&#8217;s <em>work</em>. It takes time. Serious time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments though? Even if they end up being post-length in nature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Easy</em>. They just flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a whole other part of your brain gets engaged. Or&#8230; Perhaps more accurate to say that in &#8216;comment&#8217; writing, a part of your brain <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> get engaged. Namely, the critic. The editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All to say, I found Wilhelm&#8217;s post today both incredibly timely, <em>and</em> incredibly enlightening, <em>and</em> amusing to boot.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>Basically, the secret to my success is low standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8211; Wilhelm Arcturis (2025), <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/08/27/blaugust-motivation-where-do-all-these-words-come-from/">Blaugust Motivation – Where Do All These Words Come&nbsp;From?</a> (The Ancient Gaming Noob)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And I should also add: accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should take the time to read the post yourself, so I don&#8217;t want to give it all away &#8212; but one last part I can&#8217;t help but to voice agreement with. I have the time to blog more. Write more. It is absolutely a choice to prioritise other pursuits (*cough* games) more often than not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps if I consciously leaned into this style more often, I could have my cake and eat it too&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;Thoughts for another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Games await.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Full List of Blaugust 2025 Participants</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/blaugust-2025-is-here/">little while</a> since I posted the list of Blaugust participants. The numbers have grown over the course of the month, too!

And if you look at it funny and kinda squint a little bit, you might stretch me to two and a quarter. Maybe even two and a half &#8212; as the missing game I <em>had</em> played before, at its PlayStation release. I just thought I might pick it up again on PC, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong> is, frankly, amazing. The gameplay trailers we saw in the four years of development often seemed as if coming directly from a game designer&#8217;s fever dream.

Turns out, there <em>was</em> a reason my friends and I have played through all three Borderlands games to date, sometimes multiple times! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was with that lens some of the gameplay coming out from content creators grabbed my attention a bunch more, and here we are, considering prioritising it against even Hollow Knight: Silksong!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Battlefield 6 &#8212; 11 October</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/other-games/battlefield-6-open-beta/">The beta</a> was enough to convince my friend group that we want in.

What I didn&#8217;t appreciate until quite recently is that it isn&#8217;t just a Singleplayer game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is there co-op, but you can even (optionally) go into a full &#8216;Online&#8217; mode where it is more of an MMO-lite, with world events/bosses, and the whole nine yards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh- it&#8217;s also free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which can be boon or bane; but at least how the devs are talking now &#8212; the monetisation seems restricted to cosmetics only. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a slew of sponsored videos like this one, where there is clearly a desire to build interest in the West before the release later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is coming across as a bit of an &#8216;everything to everyone&#8217; game at the moment, which again&#8230; Could be concerning.

Because I <em>thought</em> it was a simple DPS race (I was <em>very</em> close to achieving it this way), but I was underestimating the game again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a mechanic there which needed to be respected.

There is a double standard at play there. But this time, one <em>against</em> rather than for myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <em>other</em> people post short posts &#8212; it&#8217;s fine.

They keep you pushing, keep you improving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But stack too many on top of yourself, and suddenly you’re not climbing higher &#8212; you’re just weighed down. And even when you <em>know</em> others would enjoy the same change-up from you that you enjoy from them, it’s hard to let yourself off the hook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>can</em> though. Hell, you <em>should</em>. Recognising when you&#8217;re holding these double standards against yourself is important. Even if not all the time, then just&#8230; Every once in a while, cut yourself some slack in order to do something a little off the beaten path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Variety isn’t just the spice of life, it&#8217;s also the secret ingredient in keeping your motivation to blog high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; And now I kinda want some KFC&#8230; </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Older Posts on Motivation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a topic that comes up with some regularity here, not least because all these years on, I&#8217;m somewhat shocked I haven&#8217;t fully lost it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t my <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/somethings-different-here/">first time blogging</a>, after all!

You can find it as you go. But it is important to recognise your motivation <em>is</em> a &#8216;why&#8217;, and not a &#8216;what&#8217;. (Generally.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/staying-motivated/">Staying Motivated</a></strong> &#8212; may involve a degree of change!

Cyberpunk 2077, for all its launch faults, is in fine form now. It wasn&#8217;t abandoned or given bare minimum technical touch-ups. Instead, it had literal <em>years</em> of additional development effort put in to make it sing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bring it up in the context of a brilliant post by <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/">Frostilyte</a>, asking the question: &#8220;<a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/18/is-it-wrong-to-support-grounded-2-in-early-access/">Should <em>Grounded 2</em> even be <em>allowed</em> to utilise <em>Early Access</em>?</a>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My title probably spoils this, but: <em><strong>yes</strong></em>. Not only <em>should</em> Grounded 2 be &#8216;allowed,&#8217; I wish more big titles had the guts to wear the Early Access label when it fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyberpunk sure should have. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, gamers were left feeling anything &#8212; or everything &#8212; from frustration to disappointment, or even betrayal. Slap the EA badge on it and suddenly? The consumer transparency preserves a mountain of goodwill and space to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281" height="461" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190826000049_1-830x461.jpg" width="830" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>No Man&#8217;s Sky</em></strong>: Another example where the &#8216;Early Access&#8217; tag really should&#8217;ve been applied.

Although I would hope not a controversial one: <em>If, for whatever reason, you&#8217;re not going to finish the game before putting it out, maybe at least be honest about this fact.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Frostilyte had more than just us consumers in mind.

AAA&#8217;s adopting &#8216;Early Access&#8217; doesn&#8217;t materially change things for the worse, and in fact, there is an argument to be made that says such a move would further legitimise &#8216;Early Access&#8217; and broaden the range of people willing to try it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>What even is an &#8216;Indie&#8217; anyway?</strong><br />The term covers a vast spectrum, from the solo dev mortgaging their house we mentioned, to &#8216;indie elites&#8217; like Supergiant, Team Cherry, or Larian, pulling in millions with sizable teams.

Getting in at the ground floor on a Paradox game is generally a good idea if you want to have any hope of learning the game in question without reliance on extensive &#8216;let&#8217;s play&#8217; styled tutorial videos. xD</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Silent Hill <em>f</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230; <em>think</em>&#8230; I&#8217;m interested?

Said mention? Just a sole entry logging ~5 hours of play time, and that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll say now what I didn&#8217;t say then: I <em>loved</em> almost everything about my time with Enshrouded, even at that early point (which must&#8217;ve basically been at release).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was just one disappointing factor for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In multiplayer, the quest state is (was? I should look into this) determined by the world state. And not just for things where maybe it makes sense (e.g., rescuing an NPC) but for <em>everything</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you, as I do, prefer to have independent bases *in addition* to the more communal setup&#8211; so far as the quests are concerned anyway, too bad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is absolutely a nitpick, and even if that is unchanged, the look of this update, let alone whatever may have come up to this point, might be the point at which I let it go and jump back in regardless.

I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb and suggest there probably won&#8217;t be as long of a wait this time around, assuming a lot of technology (and perhaps even asset) re-use from Wukong.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vampire: the Masquerade -Bloodlines 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno about this one anymore.

Which is a shame, as this occupied the #1 spot on my Steam wishlist for probably a good few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess I might be listing it here now more out of morbid curiosity than anything else.

There are always various things I want to do, each and every day &#8211; <em>want to</em> being the operative word here, not <em>have to</em>, which makes all the difference to me &#8211; and it still feels like I&#8217;m having a big adventure.</p>\n<p>By now I&#8217;m firmly settled in tier five, which means that I&#8217;ve pretty much explored the whole of Hagga Basin (with only a few bandit outposts missing here and there), fulfilled almost all contracts, and of course crafted a Scout Ornithopter as well as the much bigger Assault variant. I actually had to modify my base&#8217;s hangar quite a bit to make room for the latter, and it still just about fits in there.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8549" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8549 size-full" height="287" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky2.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8549">It dwarfs the buggy parked below, and that thing&#8217;s by no means small</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Just like the buggy before it, getting the first flying vehicle has changed how the game is played substantially. It obviously makes getting to places go much quicker, and even regions <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/23/every-day-on-arrakis-is-an-adventure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as jagged as Hagga Rift</a> have become pretty easy to traverse all of a sudden.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8550" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8550 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8550">No more getting lost down there, ha!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In most other games I&#8217;d probably have perceived this as a downside. In my opinion advanced means of travel often lead to the game world shrinking to the point of not feeling like a <em>world</em> at all anymore. On Arrakis it&#8217;s different somehow.</p>\n<p>First of all, it&#8217;s <em>extremely</em> fun! Turning off the engines and gliding in near silence over and across this beautiful landscapes is a feeling that screenshots can&#8217;t convey &#8211; it has to be experienced.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8551 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky4.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Another important aspect is that the game is very well designed in terms of progression.</p>\n<p>Just as I was realizing how big even the starting area is and how far apart the safe zones are, I got to build a sand bike. Next up the weight and volume of all kinds of stuff kept getting bigger, and harvesting the increasing amounts of required resources by hand got a bit tedious&#8230;buggy to the rescue!</p>\n<p>And now that I can fly everywhere? What do you know, the next tier of resources can only be found far out in the middle of nowhere &#8211; and &#8220;nowhere&#8221; is completely irradiated to boot, so getting in and out quickly is key.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8552" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8552 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8552">I&#8217;m NOT stepping into that sludge, hazmat suit or no!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In other words, everything happens or becomes available at just the right time, which I find pretty amazing.</p>\n<p>The devs took that into account when designing the various contracts, too. In the early game everything is relatively close by, and backtracking is rarely needed. By contrast, the other day I flew no less than four times to Harko Village and back to Hagga Basin because multiple quest lines I was working on required it. Without my own &#8216;thopter this would have been extremely inconvenient &#8211; and expensive, too &#8211; but as these were mid- to late-game contracts it is (correctly) assumed that zipping to and fro isn&#8217;t a problem anymore at that point.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8553" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8553 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky6.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8553">So they <strong>do</strong> have castles and such on Arrakis after all</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Speaking of quests, I&#8217;ve recently finished the first DLC-storyline, and I think it&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s divided into a continuation of the main story, which all players get for free, and a separate, paywalled questline.</p>\n<p>The latter&#8217;s overarching theme is &#8220;Bad AI&#8221;, or at the very least &#8220;Dangerous AI&#8221;, and not only does that fit well into the time we&#8217;re living in, it&#8217;s also a way for the devs to do something very different while not actually deviating from Dune lore.</p>\n<p>The screenshot above shows a game world designed by an AI for its coder and best (and only) friend. I think you can guess what kind of game it&#8217;s supposed to be. I especially appreciate the effort that went into changing even loot containers and such to fit the game&#8217;s aesthetics. It&#8217;s actually quite a sad story, but I liked it.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8554 size-full" height="299" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky7.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Another AI has developed more of a sinister personality, and its hiding place very much reflects that. It&#8217;s basically <em>Dead Space</em> on Arrakis. Really intense, that one!</p>\n<p>Recovering the third AI (which actually comes first when you play through it in order) wasn&#8217;t as memorable, but it&#8217;s still a cool introduction to the theme.</p>\n<p>Each of these quests culminates in a boss battle. Those aren&#8217;t particularly difficult, but I was glad to have <em>The Sentinel</em> equipped (as always), the little floating turret from the Mentat skill tree, because it helped immensely with keeping the swarms of AI-controlled opponents at bay.</p>\n<p>As of yet I haven&#8217;t even built the DLC-exclusive vehicle, the Treadwheel, nor have I used the Duneman building set, but I can highly recommend buying this piece of content for the storyline alone. It&#8217;s of the short variety for sure, but add in the other stuff and I think it&#8217;s well worth the 13 bucks.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8555" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8555 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8555">&#8220;Help me, Mailvaltar, you&#8217;re my only hope!&#8221; Or something.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The new main story quests are pretty cool, too. Among other things I&#8217;ve infiltrated the hideout of a Harkonnen cannibal (seriously), eliminated a cultist leader, and solved a full-blown murder mystery. Like most endeavours in this universe all of this turns out to be quite a bit more ambiguous than it seems at first.

It&#8217;s&#8230;janky, for lack of a better word. For example, it&#8217;s very easy to get stuck on the tiniest pieces of terrain, which can get you in big trouble when multiple enemies are trying to kill you at the same time.</p>\n<p>Also, you get staggered or stunned all the fricking time, and while that&#8217;s not due to said jankyness but a deliberate design decision (at least I assume that it is) that&#8217;s not really fun, and also <em>very</em> dangerous for obvious reasons.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8557" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8557 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8557">Gross&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Surprisingly though, I enjoy the combat quite a lot despite these shortcomings.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not really difficult in the usual sense of the word, but since it&#8217;s always a bit unpredictable it&#8217;s not exactly easy either. And, as I&#8217;ve talked about in the post linked at the top, there <em>is</em> a death penalty in place, so dying isn&#8217;t something that I want to happen often. Side note: I made a mistake in that post when I said that you drop only Solaris when you die in PvE &#8211; items you&#8217;ve looted like schematics, spice-infused dust etc. drop on death too, and you&#8217;ll usually want that stuff back. In short, there&#8217;s always a bit of tension, but not too much, which is just the way I like it.</p>\n<p>But who knows, maybe I&#8217;ve just grown fond of the Funcom-jankyness during my hundreds of hours playing The Secret World.

While I was building my first two bases in <em>Dune: Awakening</em> those limits already reared their ugly head, as I had a really hard time imagining how to mold all those different floors, walls, roofs, inclines and whathaveyou into anything other than a functional but ugly cube. I would not have made a good architect, that much is certain.</p>\n<p>I knew that I wanted my next and probably permanent main base to look at least somewhat nice though, so I started to look around and see what other players have done to get some inspiration.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, YouTube turned out to be the best place for that. What <em>did</em> surprise me was that some folks don&#8217;t just show off their great designs, they&#8217;ve even included step by step instructions to recreate them.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8517 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s what I did to get started. Many thanks to Arathy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@crimsonfelisbuilds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crimson Builds</a> for creating this base and taking the time to make that video!</p>\n<p>I still had to get a bit creative though, because, as you can see, the site I&#8217;d chosen to build the base at isn&#8217;t just flat land &#8211; what can I say, I <em>need</em> to have a room with a view &#8211; and the game doesn&#8217;t support terraforming. You <em>can</em> build in, around and even through concrete rock, but there are limits. Also, when there&#8217;s rock or sand inside your base you can&#8217;t place any facilities or furniture on top of it.</p>\n<p>To circumvent losing too much usable space on the ground floor I&#8217;d raised the foundations as much as possible at first &#8211; it seemed to be a good idea at the time. I didn&#8217;t place all of them right away though, as I needed to procure a lot more resources for the full build first. To protect the buggy and myself in the meantime I quickly erected some walls and a roof, and placed some generators, water cisterns and storage containers to collect and refine the building materials on site.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8518 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion3.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Once preparations were completed I tore down the roof and walls again and extended the foundations in all directions to complete the intended footprint &#8211; at least I tried to. Unfortunately the natural ground declines a bit towards the cliffs, and the game didn&#8217;t let me place the last row for lack of support.</p>\n<p>Adjacent foundations have to be built at the same height, so I had no other choice than to tear them all down and start over. However, there was lots of stuff lying around by now. Grrrr!</p>\n<p>What happened next was basically a game of Tetris. Move all facilities to one side, tear some foundations down, build new ones on a lower level, push everything onto those, destroy the rest&#8230;all while trying not to get a sunburn and hoping for the next sandstorm to take its sweet time.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8519" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8519 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8519">I&#8217;ve got the power! Still not enough though&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It all worked out in the end, and once the foundations were in place finishing the build wasn&#8217;t much of a problem.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using this base for about ten days since then, and I&#8217;m really digging it. Also, <em>now</em> I&#8217;m much more in my element again, namely taking something that&#8217;s already there and refining it to my liking. I add, remove or memodel bits and pieces all the time, and I&#8217;ll continue to do so until I&#8217;m completely satisfied.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;generator wing&#8221; seen above, for example, was a thorn in my side right from the start. Then I remembered that those things basically don&#8217;t have to be touched anymore once they&#8217;re up and running, so I built another floor on top of them and covered the gap with some stairs. Now it&#8217;s as if that part of the house doesn&#8217;t exist, and I&#8217;ve gained an elevated relaxation- or conference-area that I didn&#8217;t have room for before.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8520" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8520 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8520">The pillar I&#8217;m standing on usually isn&#8217;t there of course</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I have few points of comparison, but I think the building system is really robust and fairly easy to use.

You can buy more and more different furniture- as well as building-sets over time, too. I just wish those schematics would state the required resources.

It&#8217;s been a long time indeed since a game has kept me engaged the way <em>Dune: Awakening</em> has and still does.</p>\n<p>The fact that I&#8217;ve played more than 80 hours over less than three weeks isn&#8217;t even what&#8217;s the most remarkable about it &#8211; this is not the first time I&#8217;m bingeing on a game that I enjoy, after all. No, what&#8217;s really extraordinary is that each and every one of those hours felt exciting and full of discovery and adventure. I&#8217;m not exaggerating.</p>\n<p>If all survival games are like this I totally understand now why they are so popular.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8480" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8480 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures2.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8480">What exactly have you guys been doing here again&#8230;?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But what makes the game feel so different from basically anything else I&#8217;ve played? Well, there are quite a few contributing factors.</p>\n<p>First of all, there is actual danger. Heat, storms, radiation, fricking high rock formations and deep chasms, quicksand, overall pretty tough enemies and, of course, sandworms. On Arrakis absolutely everything is trying to kill you.</p>\n<p>Now, except for when <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/15/the-desert-giveth-shai-hulud-taketh-away/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">being swallowed by a worm</a> the penalty for dying usually isn&#8217;t all that harsh. You drop any Solari you had on you, and if you didn&#8217;t place a respawn beacon nearby you may find yourself quite a ways away from where you were. You can still go back and reclaim your cash though, so all you&#8217;ll lose is some time. And water. And probably some durability on your vehicle of choice.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8481" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8481 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8481">Oh, you&#8217;ve got to be kidding me</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Dying&#8217;s not the end of the world, is what I&#8217;m saying, but you&#8217;d still prefer it didn&#8217;t happen. Which is why I always try to be cautious and alert, and I&#8217;ve died only three times total thus far as a result.</p>\n<p>For me this really hits kind of a sweet spot. Death penalties suck ass in games where you inevitably die very often, possibly even without you having any chance to prevent it &#8211; think an MMORPG dungeon group wiping repeatedly because others aren&#8217;t doing their jobs.</p>\n<p>However, when dying is of absolutely no consequence there can be no sense of danger. So penalizing death, but not too severely, <em>and</em> giving me the agency to prevent it from ever happening (at least theoretically) is the optimal way to do it in my opinion, as it causes just the right amount of tension.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8482" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8482 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8482">I cranked up the brightness by a lot already, believe it or not</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As I said earlier, human beings and gigantic worms aren&#8217;t the only dangerous things on Arrakis. The area pictured on the two screenshots above is called Hagga Rift, and I&#8217;ve never seen, much less traversed, a more jagged and fascinating, yet also disorienting and treacherous landscape in a game before.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine getting around on foot or bike isn&#8217;t an easy feat here, and I got very confused during my first forays into the area. That it gets really dark the closer to the canyon&#8217;s bottom you get doesn&#8217;t help one bit.</p>\n<p>Even when I slowly started to know my way around the environment kept throwing curveballs at me. Like when I fell through a hole in the floor while looting a shipwreck (did I mention that it&#8217;s fricking dark down there?), only that said hole didn&#8217;t lead to where I thought it would &#8211; as it turned out I&#8217;d already been on the ship&#8217;s lowest deck, and I now found myself in a free fall all the way down into the canyon. Bless the Maker and His water for suspensor belts!</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8483" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8483 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8483">Plants!! I never thought I&#8217;d see the day&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There are many little examples like this that perfectly showcase a world that has been deliberately and meticulously crafted, brick by brick. If there was any kind of procedural generation at work here it certainly doesn&#8217;t feel like it.</p>\n<p>Each of the various areas, despite technically all falling into the &#8220;desert biome&#8221; category for obvious reasons, has a very distinct style, and poses its own challenges when traversing it. Just the other day I ventured into another hitherto undiscovered region, and this one looks and feels completely different yet again (shown above). Reminds me a bit of Arizona, to be honest.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the landscape either, the enemies and their bases also have their very own aesthetics. Like this lair that, if you ask me, kinda screams &#8220;death cult&#8221;&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8484" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8484 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures6.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8484">No, I&#8217;m not staying, but thanks for asking</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The imperial testing stations I&#8217;ve <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/10/arrakis-is-a-perilous-place-even-in-the-shade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">talked about before</a> are also varied enough to not become a bore.

In the end I always do make it back of course, and that&#8217;s just the greatest and most satisfying sensation.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8486" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8486 size-full" height="305" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8486">We want it just like it was. A brand new dune buggy. Otherwise we&#8217;ll get mad!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t even mentioned yet that I&#8217;ve crafted this cool ride by now, have I? Well, there it is.</p>\n<p>Having a buggy really changes the game quite significantly. For one, its cutteray sucks so much more material out of resource nodes than the handheld version that it&#8217;s not even funny. Naturally it can also carry a crapton of stuff to go along with that, which is not only great for gathering, but also for moving shit around between bases &#8211; or for moving bases altogether.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8487" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8487 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8487">Leaving my Borg Cube behind for good&#8230;more about my new base next time</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At this stage of the game these features aren&#8217;t just nice to have though, they pretty much become a necessity. Building things like better refineries, bigger water cisterns and so on requires more and more resources, and as a consequence your base keeps growing not only in size, but also in terms of how much stuff you have crammed into it.</p>\n<p>Which is another thing that Dune: Awakening does very well in my opinion: progression.</p>\n<p>It all feels very natural to me, and it&#8217;s paced just right. Moving through the resource tiers happens more or less on autopilot thus far, and I feel neither forced to rush anything, nor held back in any way. It&#8217;s also very satisfying to progress to the next tier because of little details like, for instance, the bigger ore refinery not only allowing you to process new types of materials, but also being more efficient when refining the &#8220;old&#8221; tiers.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8488" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8488 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8488">These things keep getting bigger and bigger though</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I really like how the skill trees open up more and more over time, too. Many abilities and passives have three ranks, but when you first gain access to a new class you can only spend points on the first rank of each. Working for the advanced trainers (most of which are found in either Arakeen or Harko Village) unlocks the second and third ranks as well as the special Spice-skills over the course of several quests.</p>\n<p>Since basically everything you do in the game rewards XP you keep levelling up all the time (I&#8217;m currently at level 129), and as each ding grants one additional skill point they tend to pile up. Thus, whenever I&#8217;ve increased the rank of a skill tree or unlocked a new one, I&#8217;ve always had just about the right amount of available skill points to pick or level up the ones that seemed useful to me.</p>\n<p>One thing that&#8217;s severely lacking, though, is having skill loadouts or something like that. It&#8217;s really tedious to swap around skills one by one, and since we can choose only three at a time (until you&#8217;ve reached a certain point in the main story it&#8217;s actually only <em>two</em>) not switching at all isn&#8217;t an option. Please, Funcom, do it! Give it a cooldown of a minute or two, I don&#8217;t care, but we really need this.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures11.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8489 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures11.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>And that shall be enough for today.

Well, when I realized that I didn&#8217;t have nearly enough screenshots of Imperial Testing Station No. 10 for <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/10/arrakis-is-a-perilous-place-even-in-the-shade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my post about the adventure I had in there</a> I decided to pay Station No. 2 another visit and take some more there. And, to be quite honest, I&#8217;d become a bit too comfy and carefree by then, so instead of hugging the rocky areas as much as possible I took a pretty long route across open sand. I thought that I&#8217;d be okay as long as I stayed clear of drum sand.</p>\n<p>I was mistaken. When the aggro meter turned red while I was still a couple hundred meters away from safety I knew I was in trouble. Luckily I had a booster equipped to the sandbike (the alternatives being a cargo crate or passenger seat), and I saved that for the moment you see on the picture above so as to not overheat it too early.</p>\n<p>How close of a call was it? Well&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8441" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8441 size-full" height="303" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8441">When the red squiggly line seen below me looks like this, GTFO!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The moment I hit the screenshot key I thought I was done for.

I have, for example, farmed one specific chest for days on end, because I wanted to get my hands on the unique rifle that only drops there. Said rifle is just one of three schematics on that chest&#8217;s table though, and I got the (also useful) sandbike engine once, and the scattergun (which I didn&#8217;t want at all) <em>six fricking times</em> before the rifle finally made an appearance.</p>\n<p>I have even logged off there to do something else for a while, then logged back in just to loot the chest again.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8446" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8446 size-full" height="315" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8446">Sometimes they&#8217;re smaller for some reason</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Despite the RNG repeatedly being a dick I quite enjoy this whole part of the gameplay loop though.

You go there, clear them out, loot everything and leave again. Calling these places &#8216;dungeons&#8217; would be overstating things, because they range from a single campfire to a couple of adjacent rooms or caverns at most.</p>\n<p>However, there are <em>real</em> dungeons too. They go by the rather unimpressive name <em>&#8220;Imperial Testing Station No. XY&#8221;</em>, but I assure you, they are anything but.</p>\n<p>You get to explore the first one of those, Station No. 2 (don&#8217;t ask me what happened to No. 1&#8230;) in the newbie region already, and while that wasn&#8217;t a cakewalk when I went there only a couple of hours into the game, it didn&#8217;t quite make me break a sweat either.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8405" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8405 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8405">Doesn&#8217;t look too intimidating, now does it?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The other day a contract (i.e. side quest) asked me to investigate Imperial Testing Station No. 10, which is located to the far east of my current area. So I stocked up on ammo, bandages and water, mounted my sandbike and got going.</p>\n<p>The entrance (seen above) looks pretty much exactly like that of Station No. 2, so I thought I knew what to expect. And I did&#8230;but, as it would soon turn out, not really.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests these places are (or were) facilities for scientific or military research, and past the entrance they lie completely underground. Hence you have to go down some pretty steep and long ramps at first.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8406" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8406 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon4.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8406">Good thing I&#8217;m not claustrophobic</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I could soon tell that the enemies here are tougher and more numerous than I was used to, and I had to fight tooth and nail from the get-go. Many of them have a Holtzman shield now (to be fair, so have I), and most packs have at least one heavy gunner, who wield some kind of gatling gun.</p>\n<p>Fortunately my usual tactic of aggroing a group, then backtracking a bit and hiding behind something or around a corner works even better in the tight confines of these stations. This way the guys with melee weapons will sprint after you first, and you can hopefully dispatch them with your own knife or sword before their homies catch up.</p>\n<p>I also made generous use of grenades and turrets, and generally kept kiting and using cover as much as I could.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8407" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8407 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8407">Some of these shots were actually taken someplace else&#8230;I had more pressing things to do than sightseeing!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I was so tense and focused the whole time that I didn&#8217;t pay attention to how long I was at it already, but after a while it dawned on me&#8230;this thing just kept going, and going, and going still.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for me you can&#8217;t really get lost down there (I hate mazes with a passion). Sometimes a path branches off, but one of the two options always leads to a dead end soon, so there&#8217;s effectively only one way you can go. At least that wasn&#8217;t a concern.</p>\n<p>But what if I&#8217;d died? I&#8217;m not sure how quickly enemies respawn, but it&#8217;s seemingly something like 10-15 minutes. Which means that I would have had to fight my way down here again all the way from the top.</p>\n<p>Then I remembered that one of the things you can craft on the fly, provided you have the resources on hand, is a placeable respawn beacon. By then I had looted enough scrap metal to make a couple, so I plopped one down right away, just to be safe.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8408" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8408 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon6.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8408">How big <strong>is</strong> this place?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Deeper and deeper I went, with no end in sight. Aside from loot chests and enemies &#8211; of whom I&#8217;d probably dispatched nearly fifty by now &#8211; I found various audio recordings providing the place&#8217;s backstory. Don&#8217;t ask me about that though, for I was much too focused on the path ahead of me to actually listen.</p>\n<p>To make things even more tense my supply of ammo and bandages had started to noticably wane by now. You find that stuff left and right, but I was consuming even more than I got. About time to finish this, I thought.</p>\n<p>Then I <em>finally</em> came to a door with a green energy barrier, which I assumed had to lead into the boss room.</p>\n<p>You see, such barriers are usually red at first, unless you have already found the corresponding &#8216;identification band&#8217;. I hadn&#8217;t picked up any kind of key during my whole run, so why was this one green? Ah, but I&#8217;d seen this before, in Testing Station No. 2! As soon as I&#8217;d walked through the door there it turned red and wouldn&#8217;t let me get out until the boss was dead.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8409" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8409 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon7.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8409">Looks so inviting&#8230;should say &#8220;DANGER AHEAD&#8221; instead!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I placed a new respawn beacon right in front of the door, checked my weapons and bandages one last time, and went in.</p>\n<p>I found myself in a large, two-story hangar of sorts, and immediately had to fight for my life. I used the same tactics as before and dispatched the first batch of enemies, then another one. While doing so I noticed someone shooting at me from quite a distance&#8230;sniper! I tried to always have something between us while fighting the others, but still got hit once, and all of a sudden I was poisoned.</p>\n<p>I started losing health fast while still fighting some other guy. Luckily I managed to finish him off quickly and applied a bandage right away. I don&#8217;t know if that stopped the poison or if it had just worn off by then, but my health bar turned from green to red again and I could heal up to full normally. Phew.</p>\n<p>Using every bit of cover I could find I then got near enough for the sniper to switch to a different weapon, but I just made short work of him with my knife.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8410" style="width: 1208px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8410 size-full" height="771" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon8.jpg" width="1208" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8410">The slow blade penetrates the shield!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I had assumed the sniper to be the boss, but apparently not. By now the contract had updated its objective to &#8220;Kill Inna Hiller&#8221;, and that wasn&#8217;t checked off yet.</p>\n<p>The hangar&#8217;s upper level was clear now, but the doors (plural because there&#8217;s one at both ends) were still red, so I went downstairs &#8211; only to get instantly perforated by a heavy gunner. Seriously, I went from full shields and health to dead in like three seconds, tops. Guess I&#8217;d found the boss, eh?</p>\n<p>I respawned on my beacon and went in again. I had learned by now that Holtzman shields are turned off whenever the wearer fires a ranged weapon, but considering how quickly I&#8217;d died I wanted her not to shoot <em>me</em> of course. So I tried to get her to start firing, only to immediately take cover and let my grenades and turret do the work, which, after a while, did the trick. Phew again. But what&#8217;s that? This wasn&#8217;t Inna Hiller either?!?</p>\n<p>At least the doors were green now, so on to the next room. This one was much smaller, but also with some opportunities to take cover. To my relief these four enemies didn&#8217;t pose much of a problem, and now the contract was finally completed. Phew the third.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8411" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8411 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8411">Loot on the right, ID band on the left (the tiny purple ring)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I looted the super chest (more about those another time), and to my extreme delight the key that lay right next to it indeed led to a shortcut back to the surface, just as I&#8217;d hoped the whole time. This, too, seems to be a standard feature of these stations, and I think it&#8217;s great design.</p>\n<p>And so my first proper dungeon run in Dune: Awakening had come to a victorious close.</p>\n<p>To tell you the truth, I&#8217;m absolutely sure that I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten anywhere near the boss fight(s), let alone beat those, without the aforementioned grenades. These aren&#8217;t consumables that you buy or craft and then equip like in most games, but come from the Trooper skill <em>Explosive Grenade</em>. If you play the game and haven&#8217;t already, I highly suggest to unlock that and give it a try. It&#8217;s <em>so</em> helpful! If you have a Technique-slot to spare also use <em>Battle Hardened</em> to reduce its cooldown a little (as well as that of all other Trooper skills, including the grappling hook).</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8412" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8412 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8412">My work is done!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m not exaggerating when I say that it&#8217;s been a very, <em>very</em> long time since I had a solo PvE experience as gripping as this one.</p>\n<p>Now, do I want every session to be like this? Hell no! Those one and a half hours (or however long it actually was) left me completely exhausted. But I was also exhilarated, and so very pleased with myself at the end! Games that can make me feel like that are a rare breed these days, so hats off to you, Funcom!</p>\n<p>Oh, and as if all of this hadn&#8217;t been enough excitement for a day I came <em>this</em> close to getting swallowed by a sandworm while collecting screenshots for this post.

In the case of Valheim, fellow bloggers like <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/search/label/Valheim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bhagpuss</a> and <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/category/valheim/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wilhelm</a> made it sound quite fun, too.</p>\n<p>I, however, played none of them despite all the praise they got. The very idea of having to take care of a character who needs to eat and drink, who can be too hot or too cold, and/or who also needs shelter lest the faintest of breezes kills him within seconds, just sounded like the antithesis of fun to me. I’m pretty sure that I actually tried a game with similar mechanics a long time ago…I can’t for the life of me remember what it was, but my vague memories of it aren’t fond either way.</p>\n<p>The thing is though, these games usually <em>do</em> have a whole bunch of features and characteristics that very much appeal to me, namely exploration, resource gathering, crafting and, above all, base building. Which is why, despite said dislike of survival mechanics, I’ve always eyed them curiously from the sidelines.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8370 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Hence when I started to read really good things about <em>Dune: Awakening</em>, for example over at <a href="https://chasingdings.com/category/mmos/dune-awakening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chasing Dings!</a>, <a href="https://www.heartlessgamer.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heartless Gamer</a> and <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Friendly Necromancer</a>, an ever growing desire to try it out took hold of me. Next thing I know is that I’m watching various videos about the game on YouTube, and once I see what players are capable of doing with its base building system I can’t resist any longer.</p>\n<p>Thus I finally decided to harden up and add some spice to my gaming diet &#8211; literally.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that I’ve only played about fifteen hours up to now, so these are going to be impressions of just the early game. To give you the bottom line up front though: I&#8217;m really digging it so far.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8371 size-full" height="278" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with why I chose this game over the others.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m not the biggest Dune fan ever &#8211; I&#8217;ve actually yet to read the novels &#8211; I quite like the first movie as well as the new ones. In terms of aesthetics and vibe the Denis Villeneuve films really are something else, and the game is very much based on those. The story takes place in an alternate timeline, but one that&#8217;s pretty interesting.</p>\n<p>Specific IP aside, I&#8217;ll take a futuristic, or shall we say &#8216;technologically advanced&#8217; setting over fantasy, dark ages or some such any day of the week.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the game looks freaking awesome. I&#8217;m by no means a graphics-snob, but here the high level of detail and realism really help to get the feel from the movies across.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8372 size-full" height="298" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read my ramblings about <i>ArcheAge</i> or <i>The Secret World</i> you know that I love me a flexible skill system. Not only does Dune: Awakening have that, you can actually unlock <i>all</i> classes on one character.</p>\n<p>You accumulate a crapton of skillpoints over time, too. I assume that it won&#8217;t be enough to unlock absolutely everything, but it seems that you&#8217;ll at the very least be able to create the combat build of your choice while also having all traversal skills as well as the various passives to gather more resources, consume less durability and so on active at the same time.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t like your build anymore or find that you&#8217;ve missed something important, fret not. Respeccing the whole thing can be done every 48 hours and doesn&#8217;t cost a thing.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8373 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Speaking of traversal, holy macaroni, the game is really fun in this regard, even before you&#8217;ve built any of the awesome vehicles.</p>\n<p>Spread across the classes you can unlock a grappling hook, an extremely fast sprint and an anti-gravity-bubble, and there’s also an equippable hover-device to either craft or loot. While these are already great on their own their real strenght comes into play when combined. For example, use the hook to propel yourself up a cliff, then press Space in mid-air to hover, and your momentum will carry you much higher or further.</p>\n<p>Getting up and down the game&#8217;s mountains, some of which being actually pretty high (and falling damage is a thing of course), becomes quite easy once you get the hang of it. And also, like I said, a lot of fun.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8374 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>As of yet I&#8217;ve only managed to build the smallest of the vehicles, the sandbike seen above. Even with only tier one parts it’s already much faster than running, and since the game world is anything but small owning one speeds up resource gathering trips or bandit base raids considerably. To no-one’s surprise it&#8217;s also a hoot to drive.</p>\n<p>My next goal is the sand buggy. The name is a bit misleading I feel, because it&#8217;s actually more like a hauler with lots of carrying capacity and built-in mining laser. A gatherer&#8217;s wet dream, in other words.</p>\n<p>The Ornithopters, of which there are three variants, should be the most fun of course, but those will probably take me a good while to get.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8375 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Resource acquisition comes in various flavors.</p>\n<p>Whenever you&#8217;re in an area where specific stuff can be found, some of it just lies on the ground here and there, waiting to be picked up. The amounts you get that way are pretty negligible though, even early on.</p>\n<p>What you&#8217;re really after is resource nodes. Those usually look like a big rock, clump or stack made out of the material in question. Scan these nodes with your mining tool and then cut along the blue line that appears to break them and get a good chunk of the stuff.</p>\n<p>Once you’re able to build a dew scythe you can collect water from plants, but early on most of this precious resource will come from siphoning off dead opponents’ blood and purifying it. The next step up the ladder will be to dissolve whole corpses in some kind of high-tech sarcophagus (I kid you not).</p>\n<p>Collecting Spice has again its own mechanics, but I&#8217;ll talk about that when I&#8217;ve experienced it myself.</p>\n<p>Overall I like how resource acquisition works in this game quite a lot. Since looting dead enemies and their bases, shipwrecks and research stations is yet another way to get your hands on valuable stuff there&#8217;s much variety here, so things shouldn&#8217;t get boring too quickly.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8376 size-full" height="293" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>This is my first base, and it&#8217;s obviously crap. I hastily slapped the first iteration of it down while the sun was scorching me, and instead of starting over from scratch at night I just kept adding to it whenever I needed more space. I didn&#8217;t know yet that <em>all</em> of the resources are refunded when you tear something down again, which is really great as it incentivises trying stuff out and also takes the sting out of relocating.</p>\n<p>Which will probably happen a couple of times, so this one is temporary anyway. I&#8217;ll design something better &#8211; hopefully much better &#8211; for my main base, once I know where I actually want to build that.</p>\n<p>Provided I’ll find an open spot there, that is &#8211; this <i>is</i> open world housing after all. It seems to me that there&#8217;s lots of space to go around though, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, the building system itself is pretty spiffy and, like I said, some folks have done ridiculously cool stuff with it already.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8377 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So what about the survival mechanics then?</p>\n<p>To my surprise I&#8217;m totally fine with them. I would actually go as far as saying that I prefer them being in the game just the way they are, instead of having none at all. Why? Because they add a little bit of tension and thus a sense of danger and adventure, while in reality not being <i>that</i> dangerous after all.</p>\n<p>You see, there is no hunger, so all you need is water, and that&#8217;s not really much of a problem right from the start. Sure, you can&#8217;t outright ignore it, but the game doesn&#8217;t make it overly hard for you to stay alive.</p>\n<p>Freezing at night ain&#8217;t a thing, but sunstroke sure is. To avoid that you only need to find yourself a bit of shadow though, so that&#8217;s usually not a big problem. Even if you do overheat, all that happens is that your hydration wanes much faster, and, again, you quite quickly get to a point where water reserves become more or less a non-issue (for your body at least; it seems that higher tier crafting will require tons of it, too).</p>\n<p>Aside from that there&#8217;s sandstorms and, of course, Shai-Hulud, aka sandworms. I don’t know yet how that might change later on, but in the starting area avoiding both is a concern, but not hard to do at all.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressionsx.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8378 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressionsx.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So, yeah, all things considered I really like what this game has to offer so far, and I haven’t even talked about crafting or combat yet as this is already getting long as it is.</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">To me Dune: Awakening is more than the sum of its parts anyway. Playing it feels like I&#8217;m having a big, exciting adventure, and that’s one of the things I enjoy the most when playing video games.</span></p>\n<p>More to follow.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/07/its-time-to-spice-things-up/feed/', 'slash_comments': '4', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/437dcc44b8a84b55b593db055be0b2ad5e4f7270a3a8d9b83303bcaa0310d98d?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressionsx.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I do appreciate having the ability to destroy a game&#8217;s environment (anyone else looking forward to <em>Battlefield 6</em>, by the way?

Once again I was inspired to try out someone new by seeing him do his thing in the live-action adaptation made by Marvel Studios.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t tell you whether it&#8217;s actually any good as an adaptation because I know nothing about the comics, but the show in and of itself is absolutely brilliant in my opinion.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s very much carried by Oscar Isaac, who plays the character(s) to perfection. The way he switches from Marc Spector to Steven Grant or vice versa in a heartbeat, completely changing his accent and speech melody, as well as his whole demeanor and body language, is nothing short of amazing. Sometimes you can see the transition in his eyes alone! I liked him as an actor before, but this performance easily made him one of my favourites.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;m a big fan of ancient egyptian mythology, Moon Knight&#8217;s adventures also get bonus points from me for their themes and setting. In any case, I can strongly recommend watching the show if you haven&#8217;t yet.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8307" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8307 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight1.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8307">&#8220;Oh, the idiot&#8217;s in control&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;I heard that!&#8221; *angrily shakes his fist*</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So what about the ARPG&#8217;s take on Khonshu&#8217;s avatar?</p>\n<p>I think he&#8217;s really fun. Unlike some other heroes he isn&#8217;t more or less locked into either melee or ranged combat, as he&#8217;s got various abilities of both flavors at his disposal. He can even morph some of them into one or the other via his talents and traits, which are unlocked from level 32 onward.</p>\n<p>When fighting up close he uses weapons like truncheons, nunchucks and a bo staff, while depending on his signature crescent blades for ranged combat. Strangely, some skills have him shoot those blades out of a pair of pistols. I don&#8217;t know how that&#8217;s supposed to work, but I assume that it&#8217;s canon.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8308" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8308 size-full" height="308" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight2.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8308">&#8220;Did he just throw the gun??&#8221; Well, not exactly&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>His unique resource is called <em>Khonshu&#8217;s Favor</em>. It starts out empty, and some abilities build it up over time. Once at 100% he can use either of two spenders (or both at the same time if specced for it), which completely depletes all favor and gives him big buffs for quite a while.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s great about this is that most of his skills need no resources whatsoever, so you can basically use everything off cooldown, and spam those that don&#8217;t have one endlessly.</p>\n<p>His signature ability is a barrage of very quick attacks with a big finisher at the end. This one, too, can be switched between melee and ranged, and while the former does more damage I prefer the latter as it&#8217;s much easier (and also safer) to use. You can &#8220;weave&#8221; it around a bit if you&#8217;re quick, but in essence it&#8217;s a single-target skill, which is quite unusual for a signature. The upside is that it literally melts bosses&#8230;well, not <em>literally</em>, but&#8230;you know what I mean&#8230;and that&#8217;s a trade-off I&#8217;m very willing to make.</p>\n<p>His Ultimate, however, is by no means lacking in room clearing capability, as it peppers a pretty large area with gunfire and rockets for 20 seconds straight. You can still move and attack with your other skills in the meantime, too. Great stuff.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8309" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8309 size-full" height="315" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8309">Call in the Batwing&#8230;err&#8230;I mean, the &#8220;Moon Copter&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I gotta say, I really appreciate how unique every hero I&#8217;ve tried up to now plays and feels. I believe they doubled down on this when they released the BUE (Biggest Update Ever) in January &#8217;17, and while that patch was met with a ton of criticism by the playerbase as well, I think they did a good job in this regard at the very least.</p>\n<p>I also really like how much control I have over each character&#8217;s specific playstyle. The aforementioned traits &#8211; it&#8217;s basically a talent tree that lets you choose one out of three options every few levels &#8211; offer more substantial alterations to a hero&#8217;s kit than most games do. Said switching between melee and ranged capabilities, or giving an attack a huge damage boost and additional DoT in exchange for a longer cooldown are just a few examples.</p>\n<p>Granted, I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface so far, what with 58 more heroes waiting to be played. But, again, the ones I have given a shot are really unique and fun, and Moon Knight is no exception.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8310" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8310 size-full" height="355" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8310">&#8220;What are we wearing??&#8221; &#8220;She said I needed a suit.&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, the ceremonial armor from Khonshu&#8217;s temple, not psycho Colonel Sanders!&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Basically the only thing that he&#8217;s lacking is a high-quality costume based on his signature armor from the show &#8211; which is no surprise of course, as the game was shut down five years before that even came out. Fortunately the one I&#8217;m wearing on all screenshots seen in this post, based on Steven Grant&#8217;s version of MK (known as &#8220;Mr. Knight&#8221;, I believe), comes pretty close to the one Oscar Isaac wears when Steven&#8217;s in charge, so that&#8217;s at least something.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s enough for today.

Even the top row isn&#8217;t &#8220;free&#8221;, it just doesn&#8217;t cost any real money</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The idea for this post came to me when I recently watched someone review other players&#8217; <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> accounts (yep, that&#8217;s a thing in gacha game circles). Several times during the video the host says that this character or that weapon should totally be leveled up to the maximum because &#8220;it&#8217;s a free power upgrade&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve played any gacha game before I don&#8217;t need to tell you this, but in case you haven&#8217;t: the resources to level stuff up are far from being free!</p>\n<p>Now, I know what they <em>mean</em> by saying that. To farm for things in this type of game you need stamina (in ZZZ it&#8217;s called battery charge), which replenishes on its own over time. So, <em>technically speaking</em>, given enough time you have a virtually unlimited amount at your disposal, which of course cannot be said about gacha currency, hence the distinction.</p>\n<p>However, in reality there&#8217;s quite a bunch of caveats to calling those upgrade mats &#8220;free&#8221;.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8279" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8279 size-full" height="270" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8279">I sure as hell didn&#8217;t get all this just because I&#8217;m such a nice guy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For one, your stamina pool always has a cap. Usually it&#8217;s 24 hours worth of recharge, sometimes even less, which means that you have to spend it very regularly in order to use as much as the game is willing to hand out to you.</p>\n<p>More importantly though, to spend stamina you actually have to, you know, <em>do stuff</em>. I mean, that goes without saying, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>Now, granted, in ZZZ I can burn six hours&#8217; worth of battery in about ten seconds if I&#8217;m in a hurry (or actually need and want just the most basic of materials), but even that can become a chore if done each and every day. Hell, spending my stamina in <em>Genshin Impact</em> became such a burden after a while that I had to <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2021/08/24/oh-boy-here-we-go-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quit playing altogether</a> for a long time. But to my point, even if stuff like this <em>does</em> only take a couple of minutes each day &#8211; that&#8217;s still not fricking <em>free</em>!</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8280" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8280 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8280">Even adopting a cute cat was <strong>a lot</strong> of work, believe you me</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But what about rewards I get just for logging in &#8211; those are surely freebies, aren&#8217;t they?</p>\n<p>Well, here&#8217;s the thing. The idea behind all of this, whether it&#8217;s &#8220;only&#8221; farming a bunch of stages for a couple of minutes or even &#8220;just&#8221; logging in, is that at least <em>some</em> players will not immediately log out again. <em>Since I&#8217;m already here</em>, they might say to themselves, <em>maybe I&#8217;ll also take a quick peek at the new event</em>, or whatever. And before they know it they&#8217;ve spent an hour or more in the game. And <em>time</em>, seemingly contrary to some people&#8217;s opinion, is neither free nor without value.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the incentive to log in can be so big that it might lead to stuff happening that you didn&#8217;t actually want to happen at all. Here&#8217;s an example. A couple of weeks ago an email informed me about ZZZ celebrating its first anniversary by gifting everyone an S-rank character and weapon of their choosing from the standard pool.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to play that game anymore (I even <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/06/06/eight-years-of-blogging-about-mostly-old-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said so</a> not too long ago), but this? Well, guess what&#8230;I re-installed and patched up the ~70 GB client, claimed the &#8220;free&#8221; stuff and then thought to myself, well, now I kinda want to try them out, and let&#8217;s have a look at what&#8217;s new in the game, too, and&#8230;sure enough I went and played the game for many hours over the following couple of weeks.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8281" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281 size-full" height="283" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8281">They sure know how to tug those heartstrings</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As long as I&#8217;m having fun that&#8217;s not actually a bad thing though, is it?</p>\n<p>Not really, no. Playing the story chapters I&#8217;d missed, visiting new areas and doing some events really <em>was</em> quite fun. However, considering that I&#8217;d much rather play <em>Marvel Heroes</em> right now, the fact that they&#8217;ve managed to pull me back in, and that I now feel almost obligated &#8211; again &#8211; to at least log in and spend some battery every day (and tend to my video store, and hang out with my agents, and&#8230;see what I mean?) does bug me quite a bit.</p>\n<p>And, yeah, that&#8217;s completely on me, I do realize that. Nobody <em>forces</em> me to do anything. I know for a fact that I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s susceptible to these practices though &#8211; which is exactly why they exist in the first place of course.

Having concluded the Avengers timeline&#8230;Thanos timeline&#8230;whatever you wanna call it, I&#8217;m now revisiting the few good flicks operating outside of that. Ok, if you also count the X-Men franchise it&#8217;s actually more than a few, but I&#8217;ve watched those too recently to go back to them yet again.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m mostly talking about stand-alone entries now. For example, I still quite enjoy <em>Punisher: War Zone</em> (rest in peace, Ray Stevenson), and just the other day I had an absolute blast with 2018&#8217;s <em>Venom</em> once again.</p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;d just hit level cap with the Punisher in <em>Marvel Heroes</em> I thought, well, what better time to give everyone&#8217;s favourite symbiote a spin. Boy, what a great decision that was.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8249" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8249 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8249">WE are Venom!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Like many heroes (or villains&#8230;depending on who you ask, I guess) he has his own mechanics and special resource to go along with it. Actually he has <em>two</em> resources to manage, because some of his abilities consume his own hitpoints, and also deal more damage the less he has left. To make permanently running around on low health feasible he&#8217;s a pretty tanky dude, and I&#8217;m looking forward to how this feels at higher levels.</p>\n<p>His unique resource is called <em>Ichor</em>, and it looks the part. Yuck. Thankfully it starts at full when you enter a level, unlike, say, Scarlet Witch&#8217;s <em>Chaos Energy</em>, which has to be built up first (I don&#8217;t know her full kit though, so take this with a grain of salt).</p>\n<p>Consequently you can go all-in right from the start, spending Ichor as well as hitpoints galore. As long as you weave in abilities that recharge at least one or the other, depending on what you need, you should be good.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8250" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8250 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8250">Have a nice life</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Most importantly, it plays well, and also looks and feels really great. It&#8217;s hard to get good screenshots of it, because his powers move so damn fast and twitchy (as they should), but I hope it comes across at least somewhat on the ones I&#8217;m showing here.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8251" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8251 size-full" height="330" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8251">So many snacks, so little time</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Having played a new (to me) hero for a couple of hours now has also highlighted some more aspects of the game where the developers went the extra mile to make each of them unique and fun.</p>\n<p>For example, every character has a basic movement ability right from the start. It&#8217;s basically a short dash, meant to get out of harm&#8217;s way quickly. The Punisher does a forward roll, Captain America lunges with his shield held in front of him, Venom shoots a tendril of ichor and then pulls himself after it. Some are too lazy to move on their own and just teleport.</p>\n<p>It gets really crazy at level 10 though, when everyone gets their &#8220;travel power&#8221;. These aren&#8217;t for combat (they even have a short cast-time), but they&#8217;re a godsend for traversing the huge maps quickly. And I mean <em>quickly</em>. I really wish every ARPG had something like this, because not only takes it the sting out of any backtracking you might have to do, it&#8217;s also <em>fun as hell</em>!</p>\n<p>Cap and the Punisher just sprint really fast, Blade, Wolverine and Ghost Rider&#8230;well, ride their motorbikes, while Iron Man, Wanda and others fricking <em>fly</em> (Ant-Man rides a flying ant of course)! It&#8217;s not just for show either. While they can&#8217;t go over higher obstacles like freight containers or buildings, getting to another floor level or from rooftop to rooftop without taking the stairs or bridges is no problem. And as for Venom, well&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8252" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8252 size-full" height="310" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8252">Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Holy macarony, how awesome is <em>that</em>? I assume Spidey and Carnage do something similar. Mechanically it&#8217;s the same as flying, so bonus points for that.</p>\n<p>Of course each hero also has their own lore-appropriate ultimate ability.\xa0 Iron Man activates the <em>House Party Protocol</em>, the Punisher calls in an armored and armed-to-the-teeth van that would make B.A. Baracus blush, and Cap&#8230;take a guess&#8230;<em>AVENGERS ASSEMBLE</em>!</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re really powerful, too. To balance that they have a whopping 10 minute cooldown to begin with, but you can shave that down to 7 or so (I think) by upgrading it.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8253" style="width: 1237px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8253 size-full" height="726" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom6.jpg" width="1237" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8253">Hell yeah, THAT&#8217;S what I&#8217;m talking about</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another cute tidbit is how heroes automatically talk to each other when they meet in the hub areas. When I&#8217;m standing around with the Punisher and an Iron Man walks by, my guy says &#8220;You should stick to making the hardware, Stark, not using it!&#8221;, for example.</p>\n<p>Sure, stuff like that can get repetitive after a while, but I usually can&#8217;t help but chuckle at the amount of snark these guys have for one another. I wonder whether this is where the <em>Overwatch</em> devs took their inspiration from, because those heroes do it in quite a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>Now you&#8217;ll have to excuse me though, those bad guys aren&#8217;t gonna bite off their heads themselves&#8230;</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Blaugust 2025 post count: 2</span></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/08/05/with-great-power-comes-great-fun/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/437dcc44b8a84b55b593db055be0b2ad5e4f7270a3a8d9b83303bcaa0310d98d?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom6.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

There is confusion about how perks should work. There is excitement at the new possibilities. There are cooks in the kitchen, brewing up the next meta. And I\'m just over here saying, “folks, this ain’t right.”</p><p>&nbsp;The main thing that "ain\'t right" is that the old perks are showing up on new gear drops, allowing for super-stacking of old and new perks together. Then, with the new perk charm slots, where you can slot one of the new perk charms, you can pick the same perk that is already on the item. For example: I was able to stack four instances of Enchanted Ward on a single armor piece—a dream for a tank, but a setup that makes zero logical sense.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I scoured for dev updates all day yesterday, and the only hint that something might be wrong was a note from Kay (the lead for New World) that the team was investigating the reports. Investigating—not "fixing a bug." I was worried this might be the new state of gear and was not excited about what it might mean.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Fortunately, fast forward to today, and NW Joel posted that it was not working as intended and provided clarity on what should or should not be happening. The old perks should not be allowed on new gear, and the same perk should not be allowed twice on the same item. Other perk stacking, like having multiple magical resists on a single armor piece, was confirmed as "working as expected," which is fine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Now we wait for a fix to be rolled out, which will involve updating a lot of perks on gear drops and will no doubt ruffle some feathers for players who have invested upgrade materials into gear. The devs were clear they are not planning on refunding any materials or umbral crystals invested in crafting or upgrades (full text copy of the dev response pasted below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;So I sit at level 70 still, with some slightly upgraded gear from my old gear set. I\'ll be waiting for the fix to be deployed before I jump into targeting my endgame build update.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/1o7jdmb/gearing_update/" target="_blank">Reddit thread discussing NW Joel\'s update</a></p><p>Text of what NW Joel posted:&nbsp;<br /><br /><i></i></p><blockquote><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hey all,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Wanted to give a couple updates on a few issues related to perks and gear that you may have encountered recently.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Old Perks on new gear. This is unintentional. We are investigating this right now and a likely fix will be replacing old perks with new sockets if you end up in this scenario. Again this is still under investigation so the outcome may change here. For now have fun min/maxing these combos, but this gear will be subject to change for anyone that uses old perk mods on new gear and the mods will not be refunded if we decide to change this interaction.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen screenshots of multiple of the same charm on an item. Though it is intentional to have multiple of the same socket type it is not intentional to have multiple of the exact same charm itself. If you are in this state any duplicate charms do not stack and you are wasting perk space. An additional note that it is intended for multiple variant perks such as Void Protection II &amp; Flame Protection II to roll on the same items. There is diminishing returns when stacking perks and its something we are watching.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Spider Cave: There was a cave that was giving out a considerable volume of loot that attracted players to it. Overall much of this loot is what I would consider entry gear for endgame and much of the chase will be around sets and 4 sockets. If it werent for the performance concerns, we would have left it. With that being said I will look towards alternative paths long term like this without congregating every last one of you to the same spot.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I added a known issue where upgrading artifacts final perk can revert your gs back down to 700 if you have spent umbral. We are working on a fix for this. For now I would recommend against it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Focused on getting fixes for gear and content ASAP so I am less active in here than the last week apologies.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sorry for the delay in responses from me, I have been busy working on fixes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Edit for clarity: Replace old perks with new perks not new sockets. Items would stay 3 socket.

There is confusion about how perks should work. There is excitement at the new possibilities. There are cooks in the kitchen, brewing up the next meta. And I\'m just over here saying, “folks, this ain’t right.”</p><p>&nbsp;The main thing that "ain\'t right" is that the old perks are showing up on new gear drops, allowing for super-stacking of old and new perks together. Then, with the new perk charm slots, where you can slot one of the new perk charms, you can pick the same perk that is already on the item. For example: I was able to stack four instances of Enchanted Ward on a single armor piece—a dream for a tank, but a setup that makes zero logical sense.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I scoured for dev updates all day yesterday, and the only hint that something might be wrong was a note from Kay (the lead for New World) that the team was investigating the reports. Investigating—not "fixing a bug." I was worried this might be the new state of gear and was not excited about what it might mean.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Fortunately, fast forward to today, and NW Joel posted that it was not working as intended and provided clarity on what should or should not be happening. The old perks should not be allowed on new gear, and the same perk should not be allowed twice on the same item. Other perk stacking, like having multiple magical resists on a single armor piece, was confirmed as "working as expected," which is fine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Now we wait for a fix to be rolled out, which will involve updating a lot of perks on gear drops and will no doubt ruffle some feathers for players who have invested upgrade materials into gear. The devs were clear they are not planning on refunding any materials or umbral crystals invested in crafting or upgrades (full text copy of the dev response pasted below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;So I sit at level 70 still, with some slightly upgraded gear from my old gear set. I\'ll be waiting for the fix to be deployed before I jump into targeting my endgame build update.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/1o7jdmb/gearing_update/" target="_blank">Reddit thread discussing NW Joel\'s update</a></p><p>Text of what NW Joel posted:&nbsp;<br /><br /><i></i></p><blockquote><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hey all,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Wanted to give a couple updates on a few issues related to perks and gear that you may have encountered recently.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Old Perks on new gear. This is unintentional. We are investigating this right now and a likely fix will be replacing old perks with new sockets if you end up in this scenario. Again this is still under investigation so the outcome may change here. For now have fun min/maxing these combos, but this gear will be subject to change for anyone that uses old perk mods on new gear and the mods will not be refunded if we decide to change this interaction.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen screenshots of multiple of the same charm on an item. Though it is intentional to have multiple of the same socket type it is not intentional to have multiple of the exact same charm itself. If you are in this state any duplicate charms do not stack and you are wasting perk space. An additional note that it is intended for multiple variant perks such as Void Protection II &amp; Flame Protection II to roll on the same items. There is diminishing returns when stacking perks and its something we are watching.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Spider Cave: There was a cave that was giving out a considerable volume of loot that attracted players to it. Overall much of this loot is what I would consider entry gear for endgame and much of the chase will be around sets and 4 sockets. If it werent for the performance concerns, we would have left it. With that being said I will look towards alternative paths long term like this without congregating every last one of you to the same spot.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I added a known issue where upgrading artifacts final perk can revert your gs back down to 700 if you have spent umbral. We are working on a fix for this. For now I would recommend against it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Focused on getting fixes for gear and content ASAP so I am less active in here than the last week apologies.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sorry for the delay in responses from me, I have been busy working on fixes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Edit for clarity: Replace old perks with new perks not new sockets. Items would stay 3 socket. Sorry noticed that in the first paragraph.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; From above - An additional note that it is intended for multiple variant perks such as Void Protection II &amp; Flame Protection II to roll on the same items.

Some doors open and you walk through; others are a teleport.&nbsp; I am not the biggest fan of this design choice; I\'d prefer all doors work equally the same.</li><li>I made level 70 at the end of my play session.&nbsp; I still am in progress on the main story quest and have multiple side quests in the new zone to pick up yet.&nbsp; I won\'t complain about fast leveling but had hoped I\'d of needed to invest a little more time and effort to max my level.</li><li>I was able to upgrade one item to 780 GS with the umbrals that I achieved via the quests and a few PvP arena matches.&nbsp; Per the dev notes we should be able to get 5 pieces upgraded to 800 each week which means likely 2 weeks for a full set.</li><li>Holy gear drops! Everything is dropping gear.&nbsp; I have so much stuff in my inventory and I didn\'t even take advantage of the bugged super loot party that they patched out!&nbsp; Since the new gear and upgrade system is new I am not sure what to salvage and what not to, but I am going to need to spend some time here because I can\'t keep going at this pace filling up storage!</li><li>Attributes were squashed and with it the amount of damage players are doing is way down.&nbsp; PvP encounters last longer and feel less spikey.&nbsp; Also heavy armor players feel less tanky.&nbsp; We are all still on old gear so I am sure this will change as we all move towards 800 GS.</li><li>Performance has been great for me in the open world but FPS dips&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Things I still need to try:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Catacombs; the new 3 person procedural dungeons</li><li>The launch version of the new OPR map; Tower of Calomel</li><li>Playing around with perk charms</li></ul><p>Some screenshots to go with the adventures</p><p>&nbsp;<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

I put in a few hours last night and made some progress through the new zone and story quests.&nbsp; Here are some quick thoughts.</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The visual are amazing and it is a treat to run across the zone and explore the numerous locations.&nbsp; Multiple locations have spyglasses at their highest points that give a cinematic view of nearby locations which has driven me to immediately go explore further.</li><li>Sound is bugged and in some instances deafening as loud bell sounds or loud metal grating sounds override everything else.&nbsp; This makes combat feel off and required me to reduce over all volume in the game to save my sanity.&nbsp; It seems to mostly be an issue in indoor areas.</li><li>Doors.&nbsp; So many doors.&nbsp; There are several haunted castles and catacombs that are interconnected mini-areas separated by doors. Some doors open and you walk through; others are a teleport.&nbsp; I am not the biggest fan of this design choice; I\'d prefer all doors work equally the same.</li><li>I made level 70 at the end of my play session.&nbsp; I still am in progress on the main story quest and have multiple side quests in the new zone to pick up yet.&nbsp; I won\'t complain about fast leveling but had hoped I\'d of needed to invest a little more time and effort to max my level.</li><li>I was able to upgrade one item to 780 GS with the umbrals that I achieved via the quests and a few PvP arena matches.&nbsp; Per the dev notes we should be able to get 5 pieces upgraded to 800 each week which means likely 2 weeks for a full set.</li><li>Holy gear drops! Everything is dropping gear.&nbsp; I have so much stuff in my inventory and I didn\'t even take advantage of the bugged super loot party that they patched out!&nbsp; Since the new gear and upgrade system is new I am not sure what to salvage and what not to, but I am going to need to spend some time here because I can\'t keep going at this pace filling up storage!</li><li>Attributes were squashed and with it the amount of damage players are doing is way down.&nbsp; PvP encounters last longer and feel less spikey.&nbsp; Also heavy armor players feel less tanky.&nbsp; We are all still on old gear so I am sure this will change as we all move towards 800 GS.</li><li>Performance has been great for me in the open world but FPS dips&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Things I still need to try:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Catacombs; the new 3 person procedural dungeons</li><li>The launch version of the new OPR map; Tower of Calomel</li><li>Playing around with perk charms</li></ul><p>Some screenshots to go with the adventures</p><p>&nbsp;<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

Today, there’s <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank">an update about how ARC Raiders will handle character wipes</a>. The system is called <strong>Projects</strong> and is optional. It offers players who want to wipe their character and start over fresh the chance to do so—gaining some bragging rights and cosmetic rewards in the process. I think this is an interesting take on the topic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Many online action games with player progression systems have implemented the concept of “wipes” with the intent to reset everything back to even on a set cadence. The goal is to keep the game fresh for veteran players and ensure that newer players can enjoy the game without staring at a mountain of progress to get on equal footing with the veterans. This makes sense for dedicated veterans and new players alike but misses what is likely the biggest player group: what I call the “core gamer.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;These core gamers, like myself, can’t put massive hours per week into a game, and thus, games with wipes become less attractive because the destination never feels reachable. We are always stuck in the progression step, and while progression is an attractive feature in the games we play, it’s the persistence of that progression that’s the main draw in the first place. Restarting after a mandatory wipe just feels bad. My friend and I quit <strong>Once Human</strong>, a game we both were enjoying, after the first wipe we were subjected to. We found ourselves logging in the next day irritated at the prospect of cutting down a hundred trees and breaking up a hundred rocks again to set out on the same journey we had just felt we’d reached an established point in.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;ARC Raiders</strong> smartly acknowledges that players like me are a core audience for their game, and the Projects concept seems like a good middle ground for all player groups—veterans, newbies, and the core alike. I really like how they’ve framed their decision here:</p><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides. Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall. So, as we have done with several other mechanics, before mimicking other established mechanics, we’d like to try our own method. Ideally to the end that best suits ARC Raiders and a larger majority of its players."&nbsp;</i></blockquote><p></p><p>The main concept of the Projects is that their initiation is <strong>player-controlled</strong>. If I have time in my upcoming gaming schedule, I can opt to start the project, and that will reset my character; my efforts will then go into the project. If I want to play the game more casually, without dedicated time in the schedule, then I don\'t have to start the project; I just keep on with my persistent progression.</p>\n<p>There are still details to understand about how players on Projects interact with those that are not. I assume they will be mixed into matches to avoid creating a queue issue where players are waiting for matches to start.

Today, there’s <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank">an update about how ARC Raiders will handle character wipes</a>. The system is called <strong>Projects</strong> and is optional. It offers players who want to wipe their character and start over fresh the chance to do so—gaining some bragging rights and cosmetic rewards in the process. I think this is an interesting take on the topic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Many online action games with player progression systems have implemented the concept of “wipes” with the intent to reset everything back to even on a set cadence. The goal is to keep the game fresh for veteran players and ensure that newer players can enjoy the game without staring at a mountain of progress to get on equal footing with the veterans. This makes sense for dedicated veterans and new players alike but misses what is likely the biggest player group: what I call the “core gamer.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;These core gamers, like myself, can’t put massive hours per week into a game, and thus, games with wipes become less attractive because the destination never feels reachable. We are always stuck in the progression step, and while progression is an attractive feature in the games we play, it’s the persistence of that progression that’s the main draw in the first place. Restarting after a mandatory wipe just feels bad. My friend and I quit <strong>Once Human</strong>, a game we both were enjoying, after the first wipe we were subjected to. We found ourselves logging in the next day irritated at the prospect of cutting down a hundred trees and breaking up a hundred rocks again to set out on the same journey we had just felt we’d reached an established point in.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;ARC Raiders</strong> smartly acknowledges that players like me are a core audience for their game, and the Projects concept seems like a good middle ground for all player groups—veterans, newbies, and the core alike. I really like how they’ve framed their decision here:</p><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides. Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall. So, as we have done with several other mechanics, before mimicking other established mechanics, we’d like to try our own method. Ideally to the end that best suits ARC Raiders and a larger majority of its players."&nbsp;</i></blockquote><p></p><p>The main concept of the Projects is that their initiation is <strong>player-controlled</strong>. If I have time in my upcoming gaming schedule, I can opt to start the project, and that will reset my character; my efforts will then go into the project. If I want to play the game more casually, without dedicated time in the schedule, then I don\'t have to start the project; I just keep on with my persistent progression.</p>\n<p>There are still details to understand about how players on Projects interact with those that are not. I assume they will be mixed into matches to avoid creating a queue issue where players are waiting for matches to start. This would be ideal in my book, as it would mix players pursuing different goals into the same matches—and if there is anything ARC Raiders excels at, it’s player-versus-player confrontation.</p>\n<p>Also, it will be key to enabling friends to play together that those on a Project can still play with those that are not. There are likely some considerations to avoid abuse—where, if a project (as featured in the article) requires certain items, those items can\'t just be given to a player by another player dropping them in a match.

I believe <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ashleyruhl.bsky.social/post/3lp5hucgsjc27" target="_blank">it\'s technically available to view online</a>, but only if you have an expensive subscription to the GDC website. So I was quite pleased when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JawaFace" target="_blank">/Jawaface</a> pointed out to me last week that at least the&nbsp;<a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1035592/Game-Narrative-Summit-Labor-of" target="_blank">slides for the presentation</a> were now freely available to view for everyone.</p><p>Slides alone obviously don\'t give you the whole picture, but they do give you a pretty good idea of just what was discussed.

If I as a layperson had to sum up Ashley\'s message to other developers based on these slides, I\'d say it\'s to not give up on passion projects for your game because your time will eventually come, and that you can get a surprising amount done by repurposing existing tools.</p><p>What I as a player found the most interesting though was the below slide, clearly added to show that date nights were a success. It shows the completion rates for the new main story added with patch 7.5 (that was <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/06/desperate-defiance-now-were-getting.html">Desperate Defiance</a>) compared to the four date nights that were added in the previous patch (for Lana, Theron, Arcann and Koth).</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUXLsalcbbyAEIl-E-s6TwerJXtfsougkZpsv_lrAlnTGytUWCS9nVYc83kzVeJpNBB0KVBSSDbMBHrtmbc3BHDqXfAK6XEtXLIJLsP2Twk9KA4kiUKShOJA_8o8O-MKknrlbQJQnwU9QlYs1VTehaJpbe385M81b29Xl0-arPo8kyYD385FxQ1Wgr_L8/s1906/Date%20night%20analytics.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="226" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUXLsalcbbyAEIl-E-s6TwerJXtfsougkZpsv_lrAlnTGytUWCS9nVYc83kzVeJpNBB0KVBSSDbMBHrtmbc3BHDqXfAK6XEtXLIJLsP2Twk9KA4kiUKShOJA_8o8O-MKknrlbQJQnwU9QlYs1VTehaJpbe385M81b29Xl0-arPo8kyYD385FxQ1Wgr_L8/w400-h226/Date%20night%20analytics.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />It shows that 30 days after release, more players had completed at least one of the available date nights than 7.5\'s story. Now, you could argue that maybe that\'s not an entirely fair comparison, seeing how date night missions only take about five minutes and are available to anyone who\'s completed the "Knights of" expansions, while 7.5 required your character to be all caught up with several years of additional story updates added since then (plus it also took more time to complete). Nonetheless...<p></p><p>I thought this was quite impressive. As someone who\'s generally less interested in the romance aspect of the game compared to others, I was kind of surprised just how popular these were. Also that Lana looks to be about twice as popular as any of the other three companions in this comparison, but then I guess she\'s the only woman running against three men.

I believe <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ashleyruhl.bsky.social/post/3lp5hucgsjc27" target="_blank">it\'s technically available to view online</a>, but only if you have an expensive subscription to the GDC website. So I was quite pleased when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JawaFace" target="_blank">/Jawaface</a> pointed out to me last week that at least the&nbsp;<a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1035592/Game-Narrative-Summit-Labor-of" target="_blank">slides for the presentation</a> were now freely available to view for everyone.</p><p>Slides alone obviously don\'t give you the whole picture, but they do give you a pretty good idea of just what was discussed. It being from a conference for game developers, the talk was obviously primarily targeted at that audience and covered things like the technical side of setting up certain cut scenes for example. If I as a layperson had to sum up Ashley\'s message to other developers based on these slides, I\'d say it\'s to not give up on passion projects for your game because your time will eventually come, and that you can get a surprising amount done by repurposing existing tools.</p><p>What I as a player found the most interesting though was the below slide, clearly added to show that date nights were a success. It shows the completion rates for the new main story added with patch 7.5 (that was <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/06/desperate-defiance-now-were-getting.html">Desperate Defiance</a>) compared to the four date nights that were added in the previous patch (for Lana, Theron, Arcann and Koth).</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUXLsalcbbyAEIl-E-s6TwerJXtfsougkZpsv_lrAlnTGytUWCS9nVYc83kzVeJpNBB0KVBSSDbMBHrtmbc3BHDqXfAK6XEtXLIJLsP2Twk9KA4kiUKShOJA_8o8O-MKknrlbQJQnwU9QlYs1VTehaJpbe385M81b29Xl0-arPo8kyYD385FxQ1Wgr_L8/s1906/Date%20night%20analytics.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="226" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUXLsalcbbyAEIl-E-s6TwerJXtfsougkZpsv_lrAlnTGytUWCS9nVYc83kzVeJpNBB0KVBSSDbMBHrtmbc3BHDqXfAK6XEtXLIJLsP2Twk9KA4kiUKShOJA_8o8O-MKknrlbQJQnwU9QlYs1VTehaJpbe385M81b29Xl0-arPo8kyYD385FxQ1Wgr_L8/w400-h226/Date%20night%20analytics.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />It shows that 30 days after release, more players had completed at least one of the available date nights than 7.5\'s story. Now, you could argue that maybe that\'s not an entirely fair comparison, seeing how date night missions only take about five minutes and are available to anyone who\'s completed the "Knights of" expansions, while 7.5 required your character to be all caught up with several years of additional story updates added since then (plus it also took more time to complete). Nonetheless...<p></p><p>I thought this was quite impressive. As someone who\'s generally less interested in the romance aspect of the game compared to others, I was kind of surprised just how popular these were. Also that Lana looks to be about twice as popular as any of the other three companions in this comparison, but then I guess she\'s the only woman running against three men. I guess this is why those of us who aren\'t that crazy about Lana will never be able to get rid of her... (I\'m joking.

I was in fact very aware that I was getting close, but to be honest the flashpoint had been a bit unpleasant from my perspective, so that distracted me... When we clicked the console at the end to trigger completion, I got about ten different message pop-ups about achievements, Conquest and seasonal progression, and the couple of seconds it took me to realise "oh snap, I also dinged legacy level 50; I should take a screenshot" were too much of a delay, as the relevant text had already faded from my screen again.</p><p>You may be wondering how my legacy on Shae Vizla ended up getting ahead of Satele Shan, the Leviathan and Tulak Hord, where I\'ve been playing for longer, and the answer is simply that I played on SV pretty intensely for a few months when it first came out, which ended up giving me a boost. It\'s also the secondary server where I\'ve completed the largest number of class stories, with that number currently sitting at four (warrior, consular, trooper and bounty hunter).</p><p>That said, these days it doesn\'t really get any extra play time compared to the other servers on which I primarily play for Galactic Seasons.

This Sunday it occurred to me to work my way through the levels in /who (so typing "/who 1-9", "/who 10-19" etc. in quick succession) and around 8pm Sydney time, what I would expect to be prime time for the APAC region, there were only a little over 100 people online on Imp side. Even if we\'re generous and assume about the same amount of activity on Republic side, 200 concurrent players is not a lot for an official SWTOR server. Maybe there are other times of day when it\'s busier if the population is still skewed towards including as many US and EU players as there seemed to be at launch, but it can\'t be <i>that</i> much better I reckon.</p><p>Anyway! The other three servers on which I haven\'t hit legacy level 50 yet are not that far off either at this point - I believe they are all around legacy level 45 or so.

When we clicked the console at the end to trigger completion, I got about ten different message pop-ups about achievements, Conquest and seasonal progression, and the couple of seconds it took me to realise "oh snap, I also dinged legacy level 50; I should take a screenshot" were too much of a delay, as the relevant text had already faded from my screen again.</p><p>You may be wondering how my legacy on Shae Vizla ended up getting ahead of Satele Shan, the Leviathan and Tulak Hord, where I\'ve been playing for longer, and the answer is simply that I played on SV pretty intensely for a few months when it first came out, which ended up giving me a boost. It\'s also the secondary server where I\'ve completed the largest number of class stories, with that number currently sitting at four (warrior, consular, trooper and bounty hunter).</p><p>That said, these days it doesn\'t really get any extra play time compared to the other servers on which I primarily play for Galactic Seasons. It does always make me a bit sad to remember <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/11/a-week-of-apac-adventure.html">how bustling and alive the Shae Vizla server was at its launch</a> compared to how it is now. This Sunday it occurred to me to work my way through the levels in /who (so typing "/who 1-9", "/who 10-19" etc. in quick succession) and around 8pm Sydney time, what I would expect to be prime time for the APAC region, there were only a little over 100 people online on Imp side. Even if we\'re generous and assume about the same amount of activity on Republic side, 200 concurrent players is not a lot for an official SWTOR server. Maybe there are other times of day when it\'s busier if the population is still skewed towards including as many US and EU players as there seemed to be at launch, but it can\'t be <i>that</i> much better I reckon.</p><p>Anyway! The other three servers on which I haven\'t hit legacy level 50 yet are not that far off either at this point - I believe they are all around legacy level 45 or so. I wouldn\'t expect to ding 50 there this season, but I could see myself hitting that milestone on all three servers in quick succession at some point next year.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/legacy-level-50-on-shae-vizla.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/legacy-level-50-on-shae-vizla.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'thr_total': '1'}

I wish I could credit the original artist (Minicrit?) with a link, but alas, RIP Google Plus. </i><br /></p><p><b>The big PvP debacle on original Ilum</b></p><p>Another thing that made headlines around launch was the planet Ilum and the PvP taking place there. You see, the western ice shelf where the Gree visit nowadays used to be a dedicated PvP area. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JNT33oSXjE" target="_blank">This brief video by Force Gaming</a> should give you an idea of how it was <i>supposed</i> to work. It was released about two weeks after launch, and the video notes that at the time, people were just flipping objectives and not much PvP was going on. This was "fixed" with a patch... that in turn <a href="https://spinksville.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/swtor-the-oops-we-just-broke-high-level-world-pvp-patch/" target="_blank">broke the area in a whole bunch of other ways</a>. The result were crazy AoE fests that the game\'s engine couldn\'t deal with very well, which caused people to gain valour way too fast, even as they were just dying over and over in the mayhem. It was just chaos and caused endless complaints.</p><p>Once again, this is something I didn\'t actually get to experience directly, as I took my time levelling and didn\'t get to Ilum until about three months later, by which time all the craziness had already died down. In January 2013, I actually wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-strangeness-of-ilum-year-later.html">The strangeness of Ilum a year later</a>", but in those first weeks after launch, it was seemingly all people would talk about on forums and news sites, about how this newly launched MMO clearly didn\'t know how to deal with PvP and was therefore already failing horribly.</p><p><b>The original Rakghoul event</b></p><p>The recurring Rakghoul Resurgence event is probably old hat to most of you at this point - just another world event that comes around every so often and which has been around for what feels like forever. The very first Rakghoul event in April 2012 though... that was something else. The activities it came with weren\'t really any more exciting than what we have in the repeating event, but the vibe was very different and unique, mainly because we had no idea it was coming.</p><p>The game was still very new at the time, had a lot going on and we were getting patches and updates about more patches all the time... but this came as a complete surprise, and the experience of everyone being confused about what was going on and slowly figuring things out over the course of the first day was unique and exciting in a way that I think is hard to convey nowadays. You can read <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/world-event.html">the blog post I wrote about it at the time</a> to get an idea though. (I also wrote <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-plague-day-4.html">two</a> <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-event-end.html">follow-ups</a>.)</p><p>Ultimately the fact that it was a time-limited one-off was also one of the biggest criticisms Bioware received, which is why they eventually swapped to making new events recurring. The Rakghouls would eventually join the rotation in <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-rakghouls-are-here.html">early 2014</a>.</p><p><b>The Grand Acquisitions Race</b></p><p>The Grand Acquisitions Race (sometimes also referred to as "the Chevin event") was SWTOR\'s second one-time world event, and a lot less exciting than the original Rakghoul incursion on Tatooine. One reason for this was that <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/world-event-take-2.html">we actually knew that it was coming</a>, even if we didn\'t know the details. The second reason however was that it was simply <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-grand-acquisitions-race-in-review.html">a lot less exciting in terms of activities</a>, as all there was to do was a time-gated puzzle quest chain and farming currency crates on Nar Shaddaa. I have to chuckle a bit when I occasionally see people say that this event should be brought back. People didn\'t even care about it that much when the game was still in its heyday and a limited-time world event was something exciting! Still, I guess my point is you had to be there to know just how underwhelming it really was.</p><p><b>The return of Revan</b></p><p>I think this one might be a bit hard to parse for anyone who started playing after 2014. We all&nbsp;know Revan is in the game, right? There\'s a whole expansion called "Shadow of Revan", no? Well, for a moment, try to imagine that there wasn\'t. Revan is in the game, but only in this weird side quest that you\'ll only see if you like doing group content, and he\'s a prisoner one moment and a genocidal maniac the next, and if you blink you\'ll miss him dying as well. Also note that you had to have levelled through and done group content <i>on both factions</i> to be able to make sense of this brief cameo, something which fans of the original KotOR were not at all happy about.</p><p>Then it\'s 2014 - we\'ve been level 55 for a bit over a year, got several new daily areas and raids, everything\'s kind of chugging along nicely if you\'re not dying for your character\'s personal story to be continued... and then we start getting <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/04/assault-on-tython-and-korriban.html">a new series of flashpoints</a> that\'s being promoted as a new story arc called "Forged Alliances". That Theron guy is kinda cute, but aside from that it\'s all a bit mysterious. Who are these new troublemakers in the shadows? The answer came <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/09/legacy-of-rakata.html">in September</a>, in a post in which I felt the need to give a spoiler warning.</p><p>Whoa, Revan is back? Revan is <i>alive</i>? Is it really him though? And then <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/10/quick-30-announcement-thoughts.html">a whole expansion with his name</a>! It was exciting times for a while, showing once again that Revan\'s name still attracted the crowds. I think reception of the expansion storyline was ultimately a bit mixed - it gave the character a better send-off than the base game had for sure, but it was still a bit awkward in the eyes of some.</p><p><b>The launch of Knights of the Fallen Empire</b></p><p>Did you realise that we\'re less than a month away from the KotFE expansion turning ten years old? I\'m sure I\'m not the only long-time player who still thinks of everything pre-KotFE as the good old days, and everything that came after it as "the new stuff". It is after all a fact that it changed the game in bigger ways than perhaps anything that came afterwards, with the introduction of features like level sync or its complete overhaul of the companion system.</p><p>Still, I\'m not even talking about all of that. What made KotFE\'s launch a "you had to be there" moment was just <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/06/fallen-empire-stuff.html">how absolutely insane the hype was</a>. A new CGI trailer for the first time since launch! Accidental leaks with announcements that could be interpreted in multiple possible ways! General Star Wars hype as <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-star-wars-hype-is-building-up.html">we were all looking forward to the sequel trilogy</a>! (Oops.) Absolute mayhem!</p><p>And when it came out, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/10/knights-of-fallen-empires-story-is.html">people (including me) did indeed love it</a>! Mainstream gaming sites were like "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/knights-of-the-fallen-empire-a-great-solo-star-wars-story/" target="_blank">hey, this game still exists and is good</a>"! It felt like we were all set for a big SWTOR renaissance... except it all fizzled out within a couple of months. People thought the story was neat, but they didn\'t want to hang around to wait for one new chapter per month. They felt there wasn\'t enough to do at endgame. And those of us who <i>did</i> stick around quickly found out how tedious the new story was to play through on alts, never mind the plot going in directions that became more and more aggravating. For the second time in its life, SWTOR had released (something) with a lot of hype and then failed to live up to it.</p><p><b>Galactic Command</b></p><p>For anyone who might not know, Galactic Command was a new gearing/endgame progression system introduced&nbsp;with the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion, and in its original iteration, it was the worst system of its kind that I\'ve personally ever seen. To add insult to injury, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/10/galactic-command-bioware-trying-to.html">people (including me) were telling them from the moment it was announced that it was a bad idea</a>, but the devs were all "nah, it\'ll work and be fun, you\'ll see".</p><p>It didn\'t and it wasn\'t. For me, the early days of Galactic Command <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/12/control-alt-escape.html">were one of my all-time low points with the game</a>. Fortunately the devs scrambled to fix it immediately after launch, but it took about six months to get it into what could be described as an "acceptable" state and many players <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/11/galactic-command-is-alright-now.html">held a grudge long after</a>. It\'s another one of those things that in hindsight makes you wonder what could\'ve been <i>sooo</i> bad about it, but if you were there, you know.</p><p><b>Theron\'s betrayal</b></p><p>I did say there were spoilers in here,&nbsp;didn\'t I?&nbsp;I think looking at the game\'s storylines as a whole, the Fractured Alliances story (consisting of the three flashpoints Crisis on Umbara, Traitor Among the Chiss and The Nathema Conspiracy) is probably not among many people\'s favourites. The writing definitely felt like it had dug itself into a bit of a hole with Knights of the Eternal Throne, and it wasn\'t clear how it was going to get out of it.</p><p>I actually think that Fractured Alliances ultimately succeeded in what it set out to do, but it\'s fair to say that it was a bumpy ride. One thing I really did enjoy about it though was the community interactions it created. Theron\'s betrayal in Crisis on Umbara was not well-received for a <i>variety</i> of reasons, but it was interesting to watch the conversation around it evolve as more people started to believe that the whole thing was just a ruse. In hindsight, there are some hints towards this from the beginning, but they were easy to overlook at first.</p><p>People just didn\'t want their love interest to betray them, and there was even a hashtag called #believeintheron making the rounds on Twitter. I remember seeing screenshots of people assembling on Odessen with all their Therons out and forming a heart-shape or something. I just thought that was very cool, and actually kind of made me more invested in the final outcome than the story itself would have been able to do on its own.</p><p><b>Darth Malgus\' return</b></p><p>Back in 2017, I wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/10/11-npcs-that-died-before-their-time.html">11 NPCs That Died Before Their Time</a>" and Darth Malgus was second on my list. I just couldn\'t believe that they put him in all the cinematic trailers and then simply had him get killed off in one of the first endgame flashpoints! I\'m not sure I was aware at the time that there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajDDJDY0Y-k" target="_blank">a supposedly deleted scene from the KotFE trailer</a> that showed Malgus being delivered to Valkorion, frozen in a block of carbonite. Even if I was, it seemed obvious at the time that they\'d deleted it for a reason and for all intents and purposes, Malgus was still considered dead.</p><p>When he really did come back with the Ossus update at the end of 2018, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-return-of-spoiler.html">I absolutely loved it</a>. It was a really well-presented surprise, and while I don\'t think it was as big as the return of Revan, for me personally it was actually <i>more</i> meaningful than that had been. It\'s hard to think that it\'s already been seven years since then - at this point it feels like it should be obvious to everyone playing the game in any capacity at all that Darth Malgus is alive. However, that moment when we first found out was definitely special. (Cue some comment about how he\'s unfortunately outstayed his welcome since then.)</p><p><b>Move to Broadsword</b></p><p>Two years ago, when <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/swtor-to-move-from-bioware-to-broadsword.html">IGN leaked the news that Star Wars: The Old Republic was going to be transferred from Bioware to some largely unknown studio called Broadsword Entertainment</a>, all hell broke loose in the community for a few weeks.&nbsp;I think dedicated SWTOR players are quite used to endless doom-saying about the game and are well-practised at ignoring it by this point, but this sounded serious, and it was not at all clear what the consequences were going to be.</p><p>To me it was probably more worrying than even the original free-to-play announcement had been, and I found myself seeking solace in spending a lot more time than usual talking to fellow content creators. I also felt compelled to try and do my own part by practising something vaguely resembling journalism, which meant assembling information from different sources and trying to put it into context for people. In hindsight it seems almost silly how much we worried, considering how little changed from a player perspective after the studio transition, but at the time it was big news.</p><p><b>Runner-ups:</b></p><p>I could\'ve tried to come up with even more stories, but I thought that 10 was a good number to stop at. Nonetheless, here are three more events that I considered mentioning but decided against because they were mostly negative but also ultimately not <i>that</i> interesting to talk about in detail in my opinion:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The original free-to-play transition</li><li>The Legacy of the Sith expansion launch</li><li>The whole <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/character-modernisation-panic-on-pts.html">character texture update</a> drama</li></ul><p>Which of all of these events were you personally around for?

You can read <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/world-event.html">the blog post I wrote about it at the time</a> to get an idea though. (I also wrote <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-plague-day-4.html">two</a> <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-event-end.html">follow-ups</a>.)</p><p>Ultimately the fact that it was a time-limited one-off was also one of the biggest criticisms Bioware received, which is why they eventually swapped to making new events recurring. The Rakghouls would eventually join the rotation in <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-rakghouls-are-here.html">early 2014</a>.</p><p><b>The Grand Acquisitions Race</b></p><p>The Grand Acquisitions Race (sometimes also referred to as "the Chevin event") was SWTOR\'s second one-time world event, and a lot less exciting than the original Rakghoul incursion on Tatooine. One reason for this was that <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/world-event-take-2.html">we actually knew that it was coming</a>, even if we didn\'t know the details. The second reason however was that it was simply <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-grand-acquisitions-race-in-review.html">a lot less exciting in terms of activities</a>, as all there was to do was a time-gated puzzle quest chain and farming currency crates on Nar Shaddaa. I have to chuckle a bit when I occasionally see people say that this event should be brought back. People didn\'t even care about it that much when the game was still in its heyday and a limited-time world event was something exciting! Still, I guess my point is you had to be there to know just how underwhelming it really was.</p><p><b>The return of Revan</b></p><p>I think this one might be a bit hard to parse for anyone who started playing after 2014. We all&nbsp;know Revan is in the game, right? There\'s a whole expansion called "Shadow of Revan", no? Well, for a moment, try to imagine that there wasn\'t. Revan is in the game, but only in this weird side quest that you\'ll only see if you like doing group content, and he\'s a prisoner one moment and a genocidal maniac the next, and if you blink you\'ll miss him dying as well. Also note that you had to have levelled through and done group content <i>on both factions</i> to be able to make sense of this brief cameo, something which fans of the original KotOR were not at all happy about.</p><p>Then it\'s 2014 - we\'ve been level 55 for a bit over a year, got several new daily areas and raids, everything\'s kind of chugging along nicely if you\'re not dying for your character\'s personal story to be continued... and then we start getting <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/04/assault-on-tython-and-korriban.html">a new series of flashpoints</a> that\'s being promoted as a new story arc called "Forged Alliances". That Theron guy is kinda cute, but aside from that it\'s all a bit mysterious. Who are these new troublemakers in the shadows? The answer came <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/09/legacy-of-rakata.html">in September</a>, in a post in which I felt the need to give a spoiler warning.</p><p>Whoa, Revan is back? Revan is <i>alive</i>? Is it really him though? And then <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/10/quick-30-announcement-thoughts.html">a whole expansion with his name</a>! It was exciting times for a while, showing once again that Revan\'s name still attracted the crowds. I think reception of the expansion storyline was ultimately a bit mixed - it gave the character a better send-off than the base game had for sure, but it was still a bit awkward in the eyes of some.</p><p><b>The launch of Knights of the Fallen Empire</b></p><p>Did you realise that we\'re less than a month away from the KotFE expansion turning ten years old? I\'m sure I\'m not the only long-time player who still thinks of everything pre-KotFE as the good old days, and everything that came after it as "the new stuff". It is after all a fact that it changed the game in bigger ways than perhaps anything that came afterwards, with the introduction of features like level sync or its complete overhaul of the companion system.</p><p>Still, I\'m not even talking about all of that. What made KotFE\'s launch a "you had to be there" moment was just <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/06/fallen-empire-stuff.html">how absolutely insane the hype was</a>. A new CGI trailer for the first time since launch! Accidental leaks with announcements that could be interpreted in multiple possible ways! General Star Wars hype as <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-star-wars-hype-is-building-up.html">we were all looking forward to the sequel trilogy</a>! (Oops.) Absolute mayhem!</p><p>And when it came out, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/10/knights-of-fallen-empires-story-is.html">people (including me) did indeed love it</a>! Mainstream gaming sites were like "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/knights-of-the-fallen-empire-a-great-solo-star-wars-story/" target="_blank">hey, this game still exists and is good</a>"! It felt like we were all set for a big SWTOR renaissance... except it all fizzled out within a couple of months. People thought the story was neat, but they didn\'t want to hang around to wait for one new chapter per month. They felt there wasn\'t enough to do at endgame. And those of us who <i>did</i> stick around quickly found out how tedious the new story was to play through on alts, never mind the plot going in directions that became more and more aggravating. For the second time in its life, SWTOR had released (something) with a lot of hype and then failed to live up to it.</p><p><b>Galactic Command</b></p><p>For anyone who might not know, Galactic Command was a new gearing/endgame progression system introduced&nbsp;with the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion, and in its original iteration, it was the worst system of its kind that I\'ve personally ever seen. To add insult to injury, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/10/galactic-command-bioware-trying-to.html">people (including me) were telling them from the moment it was announced that it was a bad idea</a>, but the devs were all "nah, it\'ll work and be fun, you\'ll see".</p><p>It didn\'t and it wasn\'t. For me, the early days of Galactic Command <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/12/control-alt-escape.html">were one of my all-time low points with the game</a>. Fortunately the devs scrambled to fix it immediately after launch, but it took about six months to get it into what could be described as an "acceptable" state and many players <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/11/galactic-command-is-alright-now.html">held a grudge long after</a>. It\'s another one of those things that in hindsight makes you wonder what could\'ve been <i>sooo</i> bad about it, but if you were there, you know.</p><p><b>Theron\'s betrayal</b></p><p>I did say there were spoilers in here,&nbsp;didn\'t I?&nbsp;I think looking at the game\'s storylines as a whole, the Fractured Alliances story (consisting of the three flashpoints Crisis on Umbara, Traitor Among the Chiss and The Nathema Conspiracy) is probably not among many people\'s favourites. The writing definitely felt like it had dug itself into a bit of a hole with Knights of the Eternal Throne, and it wasn\'t clear how it was going to get out of it.</p><p>I actually think that Fractured Alliances ultimately succeeded in what it set out to do, but it\'s fair to say that it was a bumpy ride. One thing I really did enjoy about it though was the community interactions it created. Theron\'s betrayal in Crisis on Umbara was not well-received for a <i>variety</i> of reasons, but it was interesting to watch the conversation around it evolve as more people started to believe that the whole thing was just a ruse. In hindsight, there are some hints towards this from the beginning, but they were easy to overlook at first.</p><p>People just didn\'t want their love interest to betray them, and there was even a hashtag called #believeintheron making the rounds on Twitter. I remember seeing screenshots of people assembling on Odessen with all their Therons out and forming a heart-shape or something. I just thought that was very cool, and actually kind of made me more invested in the final outcome than the story itself would have been able to do on its own.</p><p><b>Darth Malgus\' return</b></p><p>Back in 2017, I wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/10/11-npcs-that-died-before-their-time.html">11 NPCs That Died Before Their Time</a>" and Darth Malgus was second on my list. I just couldn\'t believe that they put him in all the cinematic trailers and then simply had him get killed off in one of the first endgame flashpoints! I\'m not sure I was aware at the time that there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajDDJDY0Y-k" target="_blank">a supposedly deleted scene from the KotFE trailer</a> that showed Malgus being delivered to Valkorion, frozen in a block of carbonite. Even if I was, it seemed obvious at the time that they\'d deleted it for a reason and for all intents and purposes, Malgus was still considered dead.</p><p>When he really did come back with the Ossus update at the end of 2018, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-return-of-spoiler.html">I absolutely loved it</a>. It was a really well-presented surprise, and while I don\'t think it was as big as the return of Revan, for me personally it was actually <i>more</i> meaningful than that had been. It\'s hard to think that it\'s already been seven years since then - at this point it feels like it should be obvious to everyone playing the game in any capacity at all that Darth Malgus is alive. However, that moment when we first found out was definitely special. (Cue some comment about how he\'s unfortunately outstayed his welcome since then.)</p><p><b>Move to Broadsword</b></p><p>Two years ago, when <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/swtor-to-move-from-bioware-to-broadsword.html">IGN leaked the news that Star Wars: The Old Republic was going to be transferred from Bioware to some largely unknown studio called Broadsword Entertainment</a>, all hell broke loose in the community for a few weeks.&nbsp;I think dedicated SWTOR players are quite used to endless doom-saying about the game and are well-practised at ignoring it by this point, but this sounded serious, and it was not at all clear what the consequences were going to be.</p><p>To me it was probably more worrying than even the original free-to-play announcement had been, and I found myself seeking solace in spending a lot more time than usual talking to fellow content creators. I also felt compelled to try and do my own part by practising something vaguely resembling journalism, which meant assembling information from different sources and trying to put it into context for people. In hindsight it seems almost silly how much we worried, considering how little changed from a player perspective after the studio transition, but at the time it was big news.</p><p><b>Runner-ups:</b></p><p>I could\'ve tried to come up with even more stories, but I thought that 10 was a good number to stop at. Nonetheless, here are three more events that I considered mentioning but decided against because they were mostly negative but also ultimately not <i>that</i> interesting to talk about in detail in my opinion:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The original free-to-play transition</li><li>The Legacy of the Sith expansion launch</li><li>The whole <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/character-modernisation-panic-on-pts.html">character texture update</a> drama</li></ul><p>Which of all of these events were you personally around for? Do you agree with my characterisation of how things went down? Are there any other major events in the game\'s history that you would\'ve included on this list?</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/10-moments-in-swtors-history-for-which.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/10-moments-in-swtors-history-for-which.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcsNcSxsfLhqSOCaVxJ1NWyLqP7L1d0CpzEKRIBtfDaSk-qki1XmEbXD298DqygHNtvzeinCG5LPio-Lfhykc8VHK5o4NA8R5o4FR3PeNiivndjqvOTvp8p7wP_RwslOKqfAELchTtXMzIVcPGmzMqh4rSicws7DVUaamRntcOPi3KRkceF2sv2MZ3H7A/s72-w99-h400-c/Getdown%20battle.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '13'}

I mean, isn\'t that a <i>little</i> bit pay-to-win? I seem to remember a time when something like "free raid gear on login if you subscribe" would have generated some outrage, but I\'ve seen very few comments even go in that general direction. I\'m not saying that people <i>should</i> be upset or anything, it\'s just... part of me does bristle a bit at how gamers as a whole have been slow-cooked into finding real money translating into in-game power less and less objectionable. Which does include me by the way!</p><p>I know I\'m going to use these tokens to buy my alts on the other servers some better gear (since the login rewards are per server, not account-wide), and I can\'t argue with the people who\'ve told me that it\'s not a big deal, considering that Rakata has been our endgame gear for three and a half years now - not to mention that SWTOR is generally not a game focused on grinding gear anyway. I just can\'t quite shake the feeling that it does still feel a little wrong <i>somehow</i> at the same time.</p><p>Anyway, if you\'ve ever wanted endgame gear in SWTOR just for subscribing and logging in, now\'s your chance. With each Rakata piece only costing 2 tokens, you could be fully kitted out after four weeks.</p><p>What I\'m actually interested in (though I doubt we\'ll find out) is how much of an impact this is going to have on subscriptions. I was recently told by someone that according to some financial report, SWTOR\'s revenue was pretty steady, but subscriptions have been down lately and more money has come in through microtransactions instead. While I haven\'t been able to verify a source for this, it does at least sound plausible if you think about it.</p><p>What are reasons to subscribe nowadays? You need to be a subscriber to do operations, but that\'s a system that receives relatively little support and new content. I\'m sure many people sub up for at least a month to check out the newest story updates every so often, but due to the voice actors\' strike, we haven\'t had a new installment of <i>that</i> since June last year. And they just removed a bunch of free-to-play restrictions that were meant to annoy people into subscribing as well. (Which I do think is a good thing for the game, holistically speaking, but I would still also expect it to lead to at least a slight drop in subscriptions in the short term.) So unless SWTOR is one of your main hobbies and you\'re constantly subscribed because of that (as is the case for me), incentives to become a new sub have been pretty weak for a while.</p><p>I guess Galactic Seasons have been another reason, since you need to be a subscriber to unlock <i>all</i> the rewards... but that\'s not a lot. For the game\'s sake, I hope that these new rewards find an audience.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>This past Tuesday the new login rewards event for subscribers started, and it will run until early December.

I mean, isn\'t that a <i>little</i> bit pay-to-win? I seem to remember a time when something like "free raid gear on login if you subscribe" would have generated some outrage, but I\'ve seen very few comments even go in that general direction. I\'m not saying that people <i>should</i> be upset or anything, it\'s just... part of me does bristle a bit at how gamers as a whole have been slow-cooked into finding real money translating into in-game power less and less objectionable. Which does include me by the way!</p><p>I know I\'m going to use these tokens to buy my alts on the other servers some better gear (since the login rewards are per server, not account-wide), and I can\'t argue with the people who\'ve told me that it\'s not a big deal, considering that Rakata has been our endgame gear for three and a half years now - not to mention that SWTOR is generally not a game focused on grinding gear anyway. I just can\'t quite shake the feeling that it does still feel a little wrong <i>somehow</i> at the same time.</p><p>Anyway, if you\'ve ever wanted endgame gear in SWTOR just for subscribing and logging in, now\'s your chance. With each Rakata piece only costing 2 tokens, you could be fully kitted out after four weeks.</p><p>What I\'m actually interested in (though I doubt we\'ll find out) is how much of an impact this is going to have on subscriptions. I was recently told by someone that according to some financial report, SWTOR\'s revenue was pretty steady, but subscriptions have been down lately and more money has come in through microtransactions instead. While I haven\'t been able to verify a source for this, it does at least sound plausible if you think about it.</p><p>What are reasons to subscribe nowadays? You need to be a subscriber to do operations, but that\'s a system that receives relatively little support and new content. I\'m sure many people sub up for at least a month to check out the newest story updates every so often, but due to the voice actors\' strike, we haven\'t had a new installment of <i>that</i> since June last year. And they just removed a bunch of free-to-play restrictions that were meant to annoy people into subscribing as well. (Which I do think is a good thing for the game, holistically speaking, but I would still also expect it to lead to at least a slight drop in subscriptions in the short term.) So unless SWTOR is one of your main hobbies and you\'re constantly subscribed because of that (as is the case for me), incentives to become a new sub have been pretty weak for a while.</p><p>I guess Galactic Seasons have been another reason, since you need to be a subscriber to unlock <i>all</i> the rewards... but that\'s not a lot. For the game\'s sake, I hope that these new rewards find an audience.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/subscriber-login-event.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/subscriber-login-event.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWR7RA_aPyOZi65LF_K35f4vq5BJsGKfVuLfuPYi6Ol9p1SsTsuUC1BgmqQOtNvQh50gzS6bfax4HG7bvyf1Tq-2eUCIQ8xz9Cj8njyjiv9goES4BSXFNUTtjF8D_RR4gTZUcfmNlGpgXU74lZzJj6cUc3Qm3uDx4Z4GsCgcAm87Awr98lRfNHqfe8L-w/s72-w400-h118-c/Subscriber%20event%20login%20reward.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

While my initial reaction was skewing towards slightly negative, I was telling myself that this is probably one of those cases where I\'m just a weird outlier for liking something (group conversations in pug flashpoints) that many people don\'t like, and that I\'ll see the benefits of this change soon enough. I still remember <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-czerka-flashpoints-in-review.html">when the Czerka flashpoints first came out</a>&nbsp;back in 2013, I was actually somewhat disappointed at first that they were so streamlined without any interactive cut scenes, but I got over that pretty quickly.</p><p>One of the seasons objectives this week was to run either the Black Talon or the Esseles on veteran mode via the group finder, and with me doing Galactic Seasons on all servers I had plenty of opportunity to see the new change in action. For the most part, the experience was... fine. I\'m not going to pretend that I would have had so much more fun if I\'d gotten the full cut scene experience six times instead of the new fade to black thing. Primarily, it was all just kind of <i>weird</i>, with a lot of running back and forth with no discernible purpose when you don\'t actually have the story cut scenes to tell you what is happening.</p><p>There was one run that really annoyed me though. I got into an Esseles on a level 80 healer, and the other three members of the group were a level 80 dps, a level 10 and a level 14. I don\'t know if the two lowbies were new players or just alts, but either way they were subject to certain limitations at their low level, such as slower speed and lacking strong AoE abilities or defensives. Yet the level 80 was constantly mounting up and driving ahead, aggroing absolutely everything to pull it into a corner at the end, while the rest of us slowly jogged after them on foot. (I would\'ve been able to keep up more but I felt it was my duty to protect the lowbies, who would\'ve died several times if I hadn\'t healed them.)</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimdkGSdQiSS4eey0f_KQQR3sjZQc7opi2V6jnxakFbjNK6yJWa4tyEMsIlbA8XLuRqKFsYTtTQQEII7EpkfSR4E80GwU22CJrs5g_dFowEL44LXMuXxjBgkejuhPPZdutfZ0C3suWotuun1gT8_nTZetUXg6BBwFj1ckgC-RR4XL0MNhrLFRKho5AbC2Q/s300/Rushy%20player%20in%20the%20Esseles.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A chat screenshot from SWTOR.

I got the impression that at least one of them got a bit flustered by that and tried to overcompensate by mounting up and rushing ahead even of the level 80 at one point, just to then be told off because not everyone had made it up the elevator yet when we were put into combat as a result of that (which was technically correct but also must\'ve been confusing in terms of mixed messages).</p><p>I got really annoyed with that level 80\'s attitude but didn\'t say anything because frankly I was quite busy just keeping up with their constant running myself, as well as just keeping everyone else alive. I simply did what I could to support the lowbies, such as when one of them veered off towards the bonus boss while the 80 was just trying to go straight to the end. I just kept hoping that neither of the little guys were genuinely new players because if I had been a newbie in that situation, I would have been <i>so</i> put off from running flashpoints ever again.</p><p>Now, to be clear, all of this technically has nothing to do with the cut scene change, because people could act like that while the group conversations were still a thing. However, at least the cut scenes would put the brakes on things a little bit. They were a reminder that this flashpoint wasn\'t <i>designed</i> to be rushed like that. And I feel that the removal of the cut scenes does the opposite now, vindicating people like that level 80 in the sense that yes, the devs agree with you that flashpoints are something to get over and done with as quickly as possible. I feel like my opinion was validated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1mvj1j5/group_finder_flashpoint_skippers_are_insatiable/">a thread on the SWTOR subreddit</a>&nbsp;posted this week about how this kind of behaviour seemed to be worse than ever since the patch. In a comment thread there, someone who commented that "games are meant to be fun" also received the reply: "It\'s a season objective. <b>Literally not meant to be fun.</b> Just a way to progress."</p><p>I just kept thinking to myself: What are we doing here? Why are we optimising content for people who don\'t like it? And I realised that I\'m worried about SWTOR flashpoints going down the way of World of Warcraft dungeons.</p><p>WoW was my first MMO as well as my introduction to doing group content with random players, and I <i>loved</i> it. The first time I did the Deadmines? Amazing. I got yelled at for ninja-looting a chest because I didn\'t know any better, but I apologised, learned from it and we moved on. For about three or four years, dungeons were easily one of my favourite things to do in the game. However, somewhere along the line, things changed. Blizzard wanted players to run dungeons in greater numbers and more often, so they became increasingly incentivised for endless replay, and people\'s attitudes changed accordingly.</p><p>I still play WoW almost twenty years later, but I rarely do dungeons in its modern incarnation now. Every now and then some reward will lure me into queueing up for a pug dungeon again, just for me to instantly be reminded of why I no longer find them fun. Everything is just an insane rush to the end to pick up the reward and it\'s a casual or new player\'s absolute nightmare.</p><p>When I started playing SWTOR, I instantly fell in love with the game\'s flashpoints too. The Esseles and Black Talon are absolutely amazing experiences that have no real equivalent in other games when you play through them in a group for the first time and as intended (which is to say, actually paying attention to the story and listening to the group conversations). They are also clearly not intended to be re-run on a daily basis. Sure, they can be fun to re-play every now and then, to see what different conversation choices do and so on, but it\'s clearly not something you\'re supposed to do <i>all the time</i>. The game won\'t stop you from running it multiple times a day if you want to, but I think it\'s fair to say that you were effectively "doing it wrong" in that case and couldn\'t really complain if it wasn\'t super fun. The idea with SWTOR flashpoints was that they were still meant to be a bit of an adventure every time you entered one, something you can only really consume in moderation.</p><p>With this change... I don\'t really know anymore. I can even defend the removal of cut scenes as a temporary measure for the Galactic Season, mostly because it benefits me personally, but people like me, who do Galactic Seasons on every server, can hardly make up a significant chunk of the player base. Clearly the intent is to get more players into flashpoints that haven\'t done them before, but I\'m not sure this whole exercise is going to show them anything appealing enough to want to come back. Endless running along corridors with no rhyme or reason about what is going on? What\'s appealing about that?</p><p>I also saw someone comment somewhere that Final Fantasy XIV used to have a similar problem with new players having a bad experience in the group finder due to issues with cut scene skipping, and Square Enix\'s solution to that was to make the cut scenes unskippable for <i>everyone</i> and increase the reward payout to make sure veterans were being suitably compensated for the fact that the run was taking longer to accommodate the newbies. Now, I don\'t play FFXIV myself, so I can\'t tell you how well that worked out for everyone, but I think it shows that "whelp, we\'ve got to cater to the people who are in a hurry" is not an inevitability. SWTOR and FF have a lot in common in terms of their focus on story, so it\'s actually kind of odd to me now to see the SWTOR devs choose speed-running over story in this instance.</p><p>At this point, after thinking about it some more, I feel like instead of removing cut scenes all over the place they should\'ve gone back and reconsidered what flashpoints are all about and why people are funnelled into them the way they are. Why do people ask to skip cut scenes? Because they\'re in a flashpoint they don\'t really want to be in. Why are they in this flashpoint? Because we give extra rewards for queueing for a random flashpoint. Why do we give rewards for that? So people who want to run specific flashpoints can get groups for them. But why would people run the Esseles in a group these days when there is a solo mode available anyway? Maybe the devs should\'ve just taken it out of the group finder like they did Kuat and Colicoid War Games. Leaving it in but taking out everything that actually made it unique and insteresting just feels like extremely muddled game design to me. It just doesn\'t make sense in my head.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>I\'ve been having fun with the new season so far and will probably talk about that at some point, but the <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/a-farewell-to-pug-cut-scenes.html">removal of cut scenes and group conversations from the group finder</a> continues to weigh heavily on my mind.

(I would\'ve been able to keep up more but I felt it was my duty to protect the lowbies, who would\'ve died several times if I hadn\'t healed them.)</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimdkGSdQiSS4eey0f_KQQR3sjZQc7opi2V6jnxakFbjNK6yJWa4tyEMsIlbA8XLuRqKFsYTtTQQEII7EpkfSR4E80GwU22CJrs5g_dFowEL44LXMuXxjBgkejuhPPZdutfZ0C3suWotuun1gT8_nTZetUXg6BBwFj1ckgC-RR4XL0MNhrLFRKho5AbC2Q/s300/Rushy%20player%20in%20the%20Esseles.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A chat screenshot from SWTOR.

I got the impression that at least one of them got a bit flustered by that and tried to overcompensate by mounting up and rushing ahead even of the level 80 at one point, just to then be told off because not everyone had made it up the elevator yet when we were put into combat as a result of that (which was technically correct but also must\'ve been confusing in terms of mixed messages).</p><p>I got really annoyed with that level 80\'s attitude but didn\'t say anything because frankly I was quite busy just keeping up with their constant running myself, as well as just keeping everyone else alive. I simply did what I could to support the lowbies, such as when one of them veered off towards the bonus boss while the 80 was just trying to go straight to the end. I just kept hoping that neither of the little guys were genuinely new players because if I had been a newbie in that situation, I would have been <i>so</i> put off from running flashpoints ever again.</p><p>Now, to be clear, all of this technically has nothing to do with the cut scene change, because people could act like that while the group conversations were still a thing. However, at least the cut scenes would put the brakes on things a little bit. They were a reminder that this flashpoint wasn\'t <i>designed</i> to be rushed like that. And I feel that the removal of the cut scenes does the opposite now, vindicating people like that level 80 in the sense that yes, the devs agree with you that flashpoints are something to get over and done with as quickly as possible. I feel like my opinion was validated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1mvj1j5/group_finder_flashpoint_skippers_are_insatiable/">a thread on the SWTOR subreddit</a>&nbsp;posted this week about how this kind of behaviour seemed to be worse than ever since the patch. In a comment thread there, someone who commented that "games are meant to be fun" also received the reply: "It\'s a season objective. <b>Literally not meant to be fun.</b> Just a way to progress."</p><p>I just kept thinking to myself: What are we doing here? Why are we optimising content for people who don\'t like it? And I realised that I\'m worried about SWTOR flashpoints going down the way of World of Warcraft dungeons.</p><p>WoW was my first MMO as well as my introduction to doing group content with random players, and I <i>loved</i> it. The first time I did the Deadmines? Amazing. I got yelled at for ninja-looting a chest because I didn\'t know any better, but I apologised, learned from it and we moved on. For about three or four years, dungeons were easily one of my favourite things to do in the game. However, somewhere along the line, things changed. Blizzard wanted players to run dungeons in greater numbers and more often, so they became increasingly incentivised for endless replay, and people\'s attitudes changed accordingly.</p><p>I still play WoW almost twenty years later, but I rarely do dungeons in its modern incarnation now. Every now and then some reward will lure me into queueing up for a pug dungeon again, just for me to instantly be reminded of why I no longer find them fun. Everything is just an insane rush to the end to pick up the reward and it\'s a casual or new player\'s absolute nightmare.</p><p>When I started playing SWTOR, I instantly fell in love with the game\'s flashpoints too. The Esseles and Black Talon are absolutely amazing experiences that have no real equivalent in other games when you play through them in a group for the first time and as intended (which is to say, actually paying attention to the story and listening to the group conversations). They are also clearly not intended to be re-run on a daily basis. Sure, they can be fun to re-play every now and then, to see what different conversation choices do and so on, but it\'s clearly not something you\'re supposed to do <i>all the time</i>. The game won\'t stop you from running it multiple times a day if you want to, but I think it\'s fair to say that you were effectively "doing it wrong" in that case and couldn\'t really complain if it wasn\'t super fun. The idea with SWTOR flashpoints was that they were still meant to be a bit of an adventure every time you entered one, something you can only really consume in moderation.</p><p>With this change... I don\'t really know anymore. I can even defend the removal of cut scenes as a temporary measure for the Galactic Season, mostly because it benefits me personally, but people like me, who do Galactic Seasons on every server, can hardly make up a significant chunk of the player base. Clearly the intent is to get more players into flashpoints that haven\'t done them before, but I\'m not sure this whole exercise is going to show them anything appealing enough to want to come back. Endless running along corridors with no rhyme or reason about what is going on? What\'s appealing about that?</p><p>I also saw someone comment somewhere that Final Fantasy XIV used to have a similar problem with new players having a bad experience in the group finder due to issues with cut scene skipping, and Square Enix\'s solution to that was to make the cut scenes unskippable for <i>everyone</i> and increase the reward payout to make sure veterans were being suitably compensated for the fact that the run was taking longer to accommodate the newbies. Now, I don\'t play FFXIV myself, so I can\'t tell you how well that worked out for everyone, but I think it shows that "whelp, we\'ve got to cater to the people who are in a hurry" is not an inevitability. SWTOR and FF have a lot in common in terms of their focus on story, so it\'s actually kind of odd to me now to see the SWTOR devs choose speed-running over story in this instance.</p><p>At this point, after thinking about it some more, I feel like instead of removing cut scenes all over the place they should\'ve gone back and reconsidered what flashpoints are all about and why people are funnelled into them the way they are. Why do people ask to skip cut scenes? Because they\'re in a flashpoint they don\'t really want to be in. Why are they in this flashpoint? Because we give extra rewards for queueing for a random flashpoint. Why do we give rewards for that? So people who want to run specific flashpoints can get groups for them. But why would people run the Esseles in a group these days when there is a solo mode available anyway? Maybe the devs should\'ve just taken it out of the group finder like they did Kuat and Colicoid War Games. Leaving it in but taking out everything that actually made it unique and insteresting just feels like extremely muddled game design to me. It just doesn\'t make sense in my head.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/flashpoints-why-are-we-here.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/flashpoints-why-are-we-here.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimdkGSdQiSS4eey0f_KQQR3sjZQc7opi2V6jnxakFbjNK6yJWa4tyEMsIlbA8XLuRqKFsYTtTQQEII7EpkfSR4E80GwU22CJrs5g_dFowEL44LXMuXxjBgkejuhPPZdutfZ0C3suWotuun1gT8_nTZetUXg6BBwFj1ckgC-RR4XL0MNhrLFRKho5AbC2Q/s72-c/Rushy%20player%20in%20the%20Esseles.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '3'}

I loved it when I found my people! And when someone disagreed about what the "right" choice was in a certain scenario, there was usually some friendly banter to be had. No more.</p><p></p><p>(Just as a disclaimer so nobody gets the wrong idea: I didn\'t "force" any of these pugs to wait for me while I was watching cut scenes.

You can actually get <i>most</i> of the way towards your personal Conquest target by doing that every day, assuming that you\'ll also have a companion go up an influence level at least once or twice in the process.</p><p>It\'s felt kind of satisfying, but also made me realise just how slow of a process it is if you\'re just sitting there waiting for your companions to run missions or craft things, especially if your character isn\'t that progressed and therefore doesn\'t have that many companions yet and they aren\'t of particularly high influence. I haven\'t really felt the weight of that in a long time, considering how long most of my characters on Darth Malgus have been maxed out in everything.</p><p>Sadly my efforts haven\'t made much of a dent in the pile of mission discoveries yet since a lot of them require pretty high skills to use, but at least I\'m making <i>some</i> progress.

Like I said back then, other people feel motivated to play in order to earn free items; I feel driven to play in order to deal with all the free items that are being thrust upon me!</p><p>I also realised that with each character having three crew skills that cap out at 700 points each, raising them at a rate of one skill-up per day to maximise Conquest points would take almost six years per character. There really was no need for me to artificially try and slow things down.</p><p>So I\'ve been logging into at least one character per server per day over the past few weeks to level up their crew skills. You can actually get <i>most</i> of the way towards your personal Conquest target by doing that every day, assuming that you\'ll also have a companion go up an influence level at least once or twice in the process.</p><p>It\'s felt kind of satisfying, but also made me realise just how slow of a process it is if you\'re just sitting there waiting for your companions to run missions or craft things, especially if your character isn\'t that progressed and therefore doesn\'t have that many companions yet and they aren\'t of particularly high influence. I haven\'t really felt the weight of that in a long time, considering how long most of my characters on Darth Malgus have been maxed out in everything.</p><p>Sadly my efforts haven\'t made much of a dent in the pile of mission discoveries yet since a lot of them require pretty high skills to use, but at least I\'m making <i>some</i> progress. I think my main takeaway from the whole exercise is that next season I\'ll need to remember to run at least a couple of crew skills on the side during each "proper" play session to make sure I can get them levelled up more consistently.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/skilling-those-crews.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/skilling-those-crews.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'thr_total': '1'}

Dromund Kaas</b></p><p>If you split the seven planets that had dynamic encounters added in 7.7 into three groups - capital worlds, starter planets and Ilum - I think both of the capital worlds definitely came out on top. With more than twenty unique encounters per planet they offer the most variety of the bunch, as well as offering an easy way to grind Conquest points.</p><p>The encounters on Dromund Kaas are thematically very varied, mostly leaning into the different regional "themes" previously established in side missions, such as the spaceport being somewhat in disarray or the lightning spires being under attack. They mostly seem to be set in the same time period as those original exploration missions, though I noticed while dispersing unruly Imperial citizens in Kaas City that one of them yelled "What is Xarion hiding?", which I thought was an interesting detail that would place that one after Onslaught in the timeline.</p><p>In general, most of the encounters are quick and fun, and strategically placed in locations where people are bound to come through on their way to some other mission objective, making it very temping to allow yourself to be distracted for a moment to complete an encounter. Prime examples of this are doing "Bad Monkey" just after arriving at the spaceport, or hunting down the rogue bounty hunter while passing through Kaas City.</p><p>If I had to cite anything negative, I\'d say that there are a <i>couple</i> of encounters with flaws. The Apex Predator in "Shock and Awe" feels way overtuned for levelling players (trying to solo it on a level thirty-something with a healer companion I was chunked to death within only a couple of hits), and the final boss for "Kubaz Incursion" can be a bit annoyingly hard to find. "Powder Keg" actually being possible to fail is a neat idea but the fact that it\'s the only encounter of this kind and that it\'s not obvious at all what is going on unless you\'re already in the know makes it a bit unpleasant in that regard.</p><p>Also, I wish they\'d fix encounter voice lines sometimes playing when the encounter isn\'t even up, because every time my speeder rides past the lightning spires I get spammed with yells about multiple encounters that may not actually all be active.</p><p>Anyway, all in all it\'s still a fun romp, and the reason it\'s edging out Coruscant for first place in my opinion is that the map makes it both cheap and easy to get around if you want to do multiple encounters. Which brings us to...</p><p><b>2. Coruscant&nbsp;</b></p><p>In general, Coruscant is one of <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/03/all-swtor-planets-ranked-from-best-to.html">my top three planets in the entire game</a>, and most positive things I said about the dynamic encounters on Dromund Kaas above also apply to Coruscant. The reason I put it in second place is simply the fact that it\'s a bit of a pain to travel between dynamic encounters due to the planetary layout with the different sectors, which all count as being really far apart, which in turn means that moving between them always requires either a looong taxi ride or paying the maximum price for quick travel. Even if you do opt for quick travel though, the sectors are still laid out in such a way that it can be a pain to just travel from one dynamic encounter within the same sector to the next one.</p><p>The said, I adore most of the encounters in the Senate Plaza, which is where I\'m always passing through when I exit my stronghold, and I basically never pass on an opportunity to set off some fireworks or to help clean up the party\'s aftermath.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/s1920/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Fireworks going off at the Senate Plaza on Coruscant" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/w400-h225/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Negatives are that some of the Black Sun and Justicar encounters don\'t have nearly enough clickies if there\'s even more than one person trying to do the encounter at the same time, the way Ugnaught Engineering was horrifically bugged when it first came out and made people get into fights about who was supposedly <i>causing</i> it to bug, stealing kills or whatever (regardless of whether it was true or not), and the one encounter on the Senate Plaza that I don\'t like, "Understaffed".

Tython&nbsp;</b></p><p>Next we have the starter planets, which I think are all pretty similar in quality, and I don\'t feel particularly strongly about the order in which I\'ve ranked them against each other. The main reason I consider them worse than the capital planets it that there are very few encounters, so you\'ll run out of things to do pretty quickly if you\'re just trying to grind on a single planet, and that none of the DEs on the starter planets give Conquest points. I can see why the devs decided to have that limitation, but it still means that for someone who\'s very Conquest-focused like me, they tend to have a lot less replay value.</p><p>With that general preamble out of the way, Tython is definitely my favourite of the bunch, since it\'s my favourite of all the starter planets and I think all its dynamic encounters are very on point, whether you\'re doing simple chores at the Jedi Temple or beating back the flesh raiders.</p><p>The only thing I\'ll say is that I do wonder a little how having a dynamic encounter pop up the moment you leave your intro phase is going to affect new players\' perception of the planet and the game as a whole, and whether it might make things come off as a bit "loud" and overwhelming to less experienced gamers. I would love to have insight into the devs\' behavioural metrics on the starter planets for that one...&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>4. Hutta</b></p><p>Hutta is actually one of my least favourite planets, generally speaking, but I think in terms of dynamic encounters it works well enough. Again, the themes of the encounters go very well with what\'s also conveyed via the existing side missions, from dangerous wildlife to rebellious evocii.</p><p>The only thing I\'m not so sure about is having an encounter that is basically a vehicle quest right outside the spawn phase, because it makes me wonder whether that isn\'t a bit confusing/overwhelming for new players. Even if seeing a bunch of droids enter the gang wars right outside the Poison Pit <i>does</i> serve to drive home the point that the town is a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/s1920/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A walker on Ord Mantell surrounded by dozens of loot beams" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/w400-h225/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>5. Ord Mantell</b><p></p><p>Ord Mantell is one of two planets where I actually feel like some of the encounters are <i>slightly</i> off in tone. This may very well be my personal bias speaking, as someone who mains a trooper and was instantly scarred by being blamed for the death of Bellis the informant at the hands of the separatists by multiple people, but I always perceived the whole setting with the separatists as very dark and desperate. Even the smuggler story with all its goofiness has a pretty dark turn here with Corso\'s parents being dead because of the separatists and him having that one moment where he wants to execute that random sep in cold blood.</p><p>With that said, I just feel like some of the encounters involving separatists feel a bit too silly. Like that mad scientist type sending you out to shoot separatists with one of his droids? It\'s one thing if there\'s a specific NPC that\'s bit ridiculous when you talk to them, that\'s clearly just that one character, but the fact that you hear the dynamic encounter yells repeated endlessly even when you\'re just driving by gives them a much stronger impact on the mood in my opinion. Might just be me.</p><p><b>6. Korriban</b></p><p>That\'s also the reason why I rate Korriban last of this batch, because again, several of the encounters just feel a <i>bit</i> too goofy to me personally. Don\'t get me wrong, both the Sith warrior and inquisitor stories have plenty of humorous moments even on Korriban, but I still always got the vibe that as a <i>setting</i>, the planet is clearly meant to be very grim, with all the racial purity nonsense and dog-eat-dog behaviour encouraged in the acolytes. Stuff like k\'lor\'slugs running wild around the academy feels more like the kind of hijinx you\'d find in a young adult book series about a magic school. (That said, looking at how busy each planet is, this one actually seems to be very popular with people, so again, this might just be me.)</p><p><b>7. Ilum&nbsp;</b></p><p>Finally, in last place - alas, poor Ilum. I really wanted the addition of dynamic encounters to this planet to feel like a revival for it. I have some fond memories of Ilum from the game\'s early days, even though it felt somewhat unfinished even then, but over time it\'s only ever declined in relevance. Sadly I can\'t say that I feel like dynamic encounters have put it back on people\'s radar, and based on the small number of other people I see doing encounters there, I get the impression that it didn\'t really land for the majority of the population either.</p><p>Good things first: the theming is once again spot-on on this one. They really leaned into the Republic vs. Empire conflict from the original storyline and even added some encounter achievements that are meant to encourage world PvP. (I\'m 99% sure that almost nobody will bother with those, but I appreciate the effort.) On the Western Ice Shelf, they\'ve expanded on the lore of the Tonvarr Pirates that were previously only really relevant during the Gree event. It all works.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/s1920/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Sith Pureblood, surrounded by pets and companions, sits on the stone throne inside Fort Tonvarr" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/w400-h225/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The problem is simply that too many of the encounters are just not very fun. Too many of them have multiple stages and feature a large number of mobs - when sometimes mob-killing isn\'t even part of the main objective, which makes it feel like you\'re just endlessly wading back and forth through constantly respawning mobs to actually get to the next clicky you need. It just feels tedious to the point that my brain keeps trying to forget that Ilum is another planet that has dynamic encounters now and I very rarely even remember to go there.</p><p>All that said, I wanted to also give a shout-out to a change to dynamic encounters in general that came with 7.7 but that I didn\'t see in the patch notes: When they released these new encounters, they changed it so that on staged DEs, you no longer need to complete every single stage by yourself to get credit, but rather you can join in at any time and still get completion. I feel that this has been a great change and has been most noticeable for me during encounters such as the base attacks on Tatooine and Hoth. It used to be that I felt that there was no point in joining in if people were already fighting the stage two walker, as it wouldn\'t give me anything and I\'d just have to restart the encounter from scratch afterwards anyway. Now I\'ll gleefully jump in and help out because I\'ll actually be rewarded for it too, which I think has been a great change.</p><p>How many of the new encounters have you done at this point? And do you agree with my ranking of the planets or not?

Even if seeing a bunch of droids enter the gang wars right outside the Poison Pit <i>does</i> serve to drive home the point that the town is a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/s1920/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A walker on Ord Mantell surrounded by dozens of loot beams" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/w400-h225/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>5. Ord Mantell</b><p></p><p>Ord Mantell is one of two planets where I actually feel like some of the encounters are <i>slightly</i> off in tone. This may very well be my personal bias speaking, as someone who mains a trooper and was instantly scarred by being blamed for the death of Bellis the informant at the hands of the separatists by multiple people, but I always perceived the whole setting with the separatists as very dark and desperate. Even the smuggler story with all its goofiness has a pretty dark turn here with Corso\'s parents being dead because of the separatists and him having that one moment where he wants to execute that random sep in cold blood.</p><p>With that said, I just feel like some of the encounters involving separatists feel a bit too silly. Like that mad scientist type sending you out to shoot separatists with one of his droids? It\'s one thing if there\'s a specific NPC that\'s bit ridiculous when you talk to them, that\'s clearly just that one character, but the fact that you hear the dynamic encounter yells repeated endlessly even when you\'re just driving by gives them a much stronger impact on the mood in my opinion. Might just be me.</p><p><b>6. Korriban</b></p><p>That\'s also the reason why I rate Korriban last of this batch, because again, several of the encounters just feel a <i>bit</i> too goofy to me personally. Don\'t get me wrong, both the Sith warrior and inquisitor stories have plenty of humorous moments even on Korriban, but I still always got the vibe that as a <i>setting</i>, the planet is clearly meant to be very grim, with all the racial purity nonsense and dog-eat-dog behaviour encouraged in the acolytes. Stuff like k\'lor\'slugs running wild around the academy feels more like the kind of hijinx you\'d find in a young adult book series about a magic school. (That said, looking at how busy each planet is, this one actually seems to be very popular with people, so again, this might just be me.)</p><p><b>7. Ilum&nbsp;</b></p><p>Finally, in last place - alas, poor Ilum. I really wanted the addition of dynamic encounters to this planet to feel like a revival for it. I have some fond memories of Ilum from the game\'s early days, even though it felt somewhat unfinished even then, but over time it\'s only ever declined in relevance. Sadly I can\'t say that I feel like dynamic encounters have put it back on people\'s radar, and based on the small number of other people I see doing encounters there, I get the impression that it didn\'t really land for the majority of the population either.</p><p>Good things first: the theming is once again spot-on on this one. They really leaned into the Republic vs. Empire conflict from the original storyline and even added some encounter achievements that are meant to encourage world PvP. (I\'m 99% sure that almost nobody will bother with those, but I appreciate the effort.) On the Western Ice Shelf, they\'ve expanded on the lore of the Tonvarr Pirates that were previously only really relevant during the Gree event. It all works.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/s1920/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Sith Pureblood, surrounded by pets and companions, sits on the stone throne inside Fort Tonvarr" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/w400-h225/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The problem is simply that too many of the encounters are just not very fun. Too many of them have multiple stages and feature a large number of mobs - when sometimes mob-killing isn\'t even part of the main objective, which makes it feel like you\'re just endlessly wading back and forth through constantly respawning mobs to actually get to the next clicky you need. It just feels tedious to the point that my brain keeps trying to forget that Ilum is another planet that has dynamic encounters now and I very rarely even remember to go there.</p><p>All that said, I wanted to also give a shout-out to a change to dynamic encounters in general that came with 7.7 but that I didn\'t see in the patch notes: When they released these new encounters, they changed it so that on staged DEs, you no longer need to complete every single stage by yourself to get credit, but rather you can join in at any time and still get completion. I feel that this has been a great change and has been most noticeable for me during encounters such as the base attacks on Tatooine and Hoth. It used to be that I felt that there was no point in joining in if people were already fighting the stage two walker, as it wouldn\'t give me anything and I\'d just have to restart the encounter from scratch afterwards anyway. Now I\'ll gleefully jump in and help out because I\'ll actually be rewarded for it too, which I think has been a great change.</p><p>How many of the new encounters have you done at this point? And do you agree with my ranking of the planets or not? Let me know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/ranking-77-dynamic-encounter-planets.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/ranking-77-dynamic-encounter-planets.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/s72-w400-h225-c/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

I <i>did</i> get both of those things, but as I always do, I have some nits to pick as well.</p><p><b>Story is coming... but later and perhaps less than we\'d hoped</b></p><p>At least when talking with some of my friends, there had been a hope expressed that the next story patch would be one big "catch-up patch" giving us a bigger chunk of story than usual, kind of like how Echoes of Oblivion and Spirit of Vengeance (which were originally supposed to be separate pieces of content) were both released at the same time after delays caused by Covid.</p><p>This... is not going to be the case. 7.8, which will come out before Christmas, will have the "Galactic Threads" story that was originally meant to be included in patch 7.6 last Christmas, and then they\'ll speed up a little bit and add "Master\'s Engima", the story originally built for patch 7.7, with 7.8.1, which should then launch at some point early next year and would usually have included only the start of Galactic Season 10 and no story update.</p><p>While I\'m glad to finally have something close to a date, having to wait another four months or so until the next story drop still hurts - by that point the game will have gone nearly 18 months without a story patch, which is unprecedented in this MMO\'s history.</p><p>The other thing that stuck out to me is that if we\'re getting the story that was meant to be in 7.6 in 7.8, what was meant to be in 7.8 before that? No story? Ultimately it feels like aside from the delays, we also <i>lost</i> one of the twice-a-year story installments due to the strike, which sucks.</p><p>Same thing with date nights by the way - they mentioned working on one back in the 7.6.1 stream, but now we won\'t even get one with 7.7.1, with the next expected release (Torian and Kira) coming with 7.8.1 next year.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Galactic Season 9: Flashpoint Resurgence</b></p><p>As for GS9, its theme is flashpoints. Yippee! There will be Czerka buffs involved like there were for uprisings during GS8, which I don\'t really care about, but I\'m good with running flashpoints with or without buffs. Unfortunately it sounded like the objectives will be veteran mode only, which is a bit disappointing to me personally and will not encourage my guildies to group up I reckon, but still, it\'s flashpoints.</p><p>The most interesting bit of the stream to me personally was the devs talking about how they were using the occasion of this seasonal focus on flashpoints to make some changes to the activity finder. A big quality of life improvement they will make is that you\'ll finally be able to queue as multiple roles again, change roles while queueing (so that you can e.g. do dailies in a dps spec while queueing for a flashpoint as healer) and it will take both of your combat styles into account, meaning you could queue as all <i>three</i> roles if you wanted and have the right combat styles for it. Now, to be clear, only the last bit of that is actually new - both the ability to queue for multiple roles and the ability to queue as a different role than you\'re currently playing were in the game before but got patched out at some point, I think because they were buggy or causing issues of some sort. Still, I\'m very glad to see these features make a comeback at last.</p><p>They are also going to improve the loot you get in flashpoints while levelling, though it\'s not entirely clear what that will mean - I\'m guessing more gear that is actually appropriate for your level and combat style, because getting drops that you can\'t even use or not use for another twenty levels was definitely a thing sometimes.</p><p>For the max levels, you\'ll no longer have to queue for all flashpoints to be eligible for additional daily/weekly rewards, but can exclude a few that you may want to avoid. You still won\'t be rewarded for just spamming Hammer Station and nothing else, but you can untick a couple you don\'t like, which I guess is nice.&nbsp;</p><p><b>No more "spacebar plz"</b></p><p>The thing that kind of shocked me was that in connection to all these flashpoint changes, queued veteran and master mode flashpoints will no longer feature any cut scenes or group conversations; everything will just be auto-skipped and if there was some sort of decision to be made (such as whether to kill or spare the captain in the Black Talon) it will just do so automatically. If you want to see the conversations and cut scenes in the future, you\'ll need to do story mode (where available) or manually walk into the higher difficulty with some friends.</p><p>Now, I completely understand why they are doing this and I\'m sure many people will consider this a major quality of life improvement. I made a whole <a href="https://youtu.be/7Wy2EA4fZrQ?si=CP0QdGpEjH5tDKy6&amp;t=144">compilation poking fun at people\'s urge to skip the cut scenes</a> <i>seven years ago</i>. I\'ve seen it all, from the guy who drops group the moment you zone into the Esseles or Black Talon, to endless arguments about who isn\'t hitting their space bar and why. It was a source of friction for sure.</p><p>AND YET. I myself have always loved the group conversations in flashpoints and was generally happy to watch cut scenes if other people wanted to do so too. I enjoy running flashpoints, but I never "spammed" them to the point where getting the Esseles again made me frustrated. (The only flashpoint that I\'ve managed to get utterly sick of is Hammer Station, and that has nothing to do with cut scenes and everything to do with the community.)</p><p>I also felt that the group conversations often inspired fun little interactions, such as when a dark or light side choice got people chatting. My guildies have seen me express (not-entirely-serious) outrage at killing the engineers or leaving Asara behind in the Esseles more than a few times. And some of the cut scenes also just genuinely looked nice! I have a whole collection of screenshots of pugs in Czerka Corporate Labs, from that last cut scene that shows your group walking into the room looking heroic.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s1741/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Four SWTOR characters about to face down the last boss in Czerka Corporate Labs.

Telling me that you can <i>technically</i> build a group manually and walk in to still see the cut scenes is a bit of a cold comfort because let\'s be real, how often do people do that? How often have you run Kuat Drive Yards since it was removed from the group finder? I just feel like this is going to be one of those things that will end up having negative ripple effects that people won\'t fully feel until later down the line. Or maybe I\'m just a relic of ancient times for having actually enjoyed interacting with my pug mates in small ways, even if there was friction sometimes.</p><p><b>Be free, F2P-ers!</b></p><p>A big change for free-to-play players that\'s coming with the next patch is that the devs will be dropping a <i>lot</i> of the old restrictions on that type of account. You will now also get sprint at level 1,&nbsp;have all action bars unlocked,&nbsp;be able to hide your head slot&nbsp; and equip random purples that you get while levelling. Honestly, with some of the things they mentioned I didn\'t even know there were restrictions for that: What, F2P players couldn\'t display legacy titles before? Or equip companion customisations? WTF?</p><p>Even as someone who\'s always been subscribed, I think this is great news. SWTOR has had a reputation for having extremely draconian F2P restrictions for a long time - I remember how the limited action bars were a source of ridicule across the entire MMO community when the game first went free-to-play. I think the devs did the right thing by being cautious when they first changed payment model back in the day (mostly because other MMOs that followed suit later and kept crowing about how much more generous their F2P model was in comparison, such as Rift and Wildstar, did ultimately not end up doing well).</p><p>However, all of that was over a decade ago, times have changed, and there\'s just no reason to be quite so brutal with all those restrictions on what\'s effectively the game\'s free trial mode. Annoying players with arbitrary feature locks before they\'ve even left the starter planet was just never great, and I hope that these changes will give more people a chance to actually fall in love with what the game has to offer and then spend some money on it happily instead of feeling nagged from the get-go.</p><p><b>What about subscribers though?</b></p><p>So as not to leave subscribers feeling unappreciated, the game will run a new "subscriber login event" from September to December where you\'ll earn a special currency if you log in at least four times a week, which you can then use to buy some goodies. I kinda raised my eyebrow a bit at one of those goodies supposedly being "endgame gear" but we\'ll see. I really don\'t need more free stuff myself, but I can\'t blame them for trying to offer subscribers a bit more carrot while easing up on the F2P stick.</p><p><b>Say farewell to endless free CC</b></p><p>Speaking of carrots and sticks, regardless of your subscription status, you\'ve long gained 100 free Cartel Coins per month if you\'ve got a security key attached to your account. I often saw delighted comments from people who came back to the game after some time away to find that they\'d accumulated thousands of free Cartel Coins while not playing. While that was nice, considering for how long the game has been running at this point, I can\'t blame the bean counters for concluding that someone coming back after years and immediately finding $40 worth of Cartel Coins in their account was maybe not so good for their bottom line. No, that free CC is not going to go away, but it will only be awarded going forward if your account was actually active in the last 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Decos, Graphics, DirectX</b></p><p>Under "other topics about which I don\'t have that much to say", we have the Feast of Prosperity returning this autumn with some awesome new decos that I\'ll definitely want to grind for. (I actually broke my habit of ignoring Twitch chat to type "LOVE LAMP" when they showed the new ceiling lights.)&nbsp;</p><p>The character customisation updates continue, with Rattataki getting updated textures next, and dark-side corruption getting a much-needed revamp so that it no longer turns every character into a pasty white dude regardless of their previous skin colour. (I might actually give showing it on my dark-siders a try once this goes live - I previously always disabled it precisely because it changed your skin colour <i>so</i> much and I didn\'t want to look like an albino axolotl.) Also, after they added all those skin colours for aliens in the last patch, they are expanding on this by adding more hair and montral colours with 7.7.1.</p><p>Finally, in technical news that I have to file under "I don\'t know enough about this to have an opinion but I guess it sounds good", they are making good progress on updating the game to DirectX 12 but there\'s still some work left to do.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, if you want ALL THE DEETS, including things I didn\'t mention here and images of various rewards, here are some other places you can look:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0E_bwCPnoM">VOD on YouTube</a> (Twitch had some hiccups and split it into several parts)&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/%5Bnews-category%5D/20250730">Official recap article</a></li><li><a href="https://swtorista.com/articles/what-to-expect-in-update-7-7-1-in-swtor-august-2025/">Swtorista</a></li><li><a href="https://todayintor.com/2025/06/28/swtor-7-7-1-update-news/">Today in TOR</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>I was somewhat disappointed by the <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/02/a-season-of-uprisings-and.html">last two</a> <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/05/77-dev-stream-more-alien-colours-are.html">dev streams</a>, but the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-sag-aftra-members-approve-2025-interactive-media-agreement">voice actors\' strike ended a few weeks ago</a>, so I was positive that we\'d get some good news about the next story update this time, and I was also hopeful that whatever they were going to announce about Galactic Season 9 was going to be more appealing to me than Season 8\'s uprising focus had been.

I made a whole <a href="https://youtu.be/7Wy2EA4fZrQ?si=CP0QdGpEjH5tDKy6&amp;t=144">compilation poking fun at people\'s urge to skip the cut scenes</a> <i>seven years ago</i>. I\'ve seen it all, from the guy who drops group the moment you zone into the Esseles or Black Talon, to endless arguments about who isn\'t hitting their space bar and why. It was a source of friction for sure.</p><p>AND YET. I myself have always loved the group conversations in flashpoints and was generally happy to watch cut scenes if other people wanted to do so too. I enjoy running flashpoints, but I never "spammed" them to the point where getting the Esseles again made me frustrated. (The only flashpoint that I\'ve managed to get utterly sick of is Hammer Station, and that has nothing to do with cut scenes and everything to do with the community.)</p><p>I also felt that the group conversations often inspired fun little interactions, such as when a dark or light side choice got people chatting. My guildies have seen me express (not-entirely-serious) outrage at killing the engineers or leaving Asara behind in the Esseles more than a few times. And some of the cut scenes also just genuinely looked nice! I have a whole collection of screenshots of pugs in Czerka Corporate Labs, from that last cut scene that shows your group walking into the room looking heroic.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s1741/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Four SWTOR characters about to face down the last boss in Czerka Corporate Labs.

Telling me that you can <i>technically</i> build a group manually and walk in to still see the cut scenes is a bit of a cold comfort because let\'s be real, how often do people do that? How often have you run Kuat Drive Yards since it was removed from the group finder? I just feel like this is going to be one of those things that will end up having negative ripple effects that people won\'t fully feel until later down the line. Or maybe I\'m just a relic of ancient times for having actually enjoyed interacting with my pug mates in small ways, even if there was friction sometimes.</p><p><b>Be free, F2P-ers!</b></p><p>A big change for free-to-play players that\'s coming with the next patch is that the devs will be dropping a <i>lot</i> of the old restrictions on that type of account. You will now also get sprint at level 1,&nbsp;have all action bars unlocked,&nbsp;be able to hide your head slot&nbsp; and equip random purples that you get while levelling. Honestly, with some of the things they mentioned I didn\'t even know there were restrictions for that: What, F2P players couldn\'t display legacy titles before? Or equip companion customisations? WTF?</p><p>Even as someone who\'s always been subscribed, I think this is great news. SWTOR has had a reputation for having extremely draconian F2P restrictions for a long time - I remember how the limited action bars were a source of ridicule across the entire MMO community when the game first went free-to-play. I think the devs did the right thing by being cautious when they first changed payment model back in the day (mostly because other MMOs that followed suit later and kept crowing about how much more generous their F2P model was in comparison, such as Rift and Wildstar, did ultimately not end up doing well).</p><p>However, all of that was over a decade ago, times have changed, and there\'s just no reason to be quite so brutal with all those restrictions on what\'s effectively the game\'s free trial mode. Annoying players with arbitrary feature locks before they\'ve even left the starter planet was just never great, and I hope that these changes will give more people a chance to actually fall in love with what the game has to offer and then spend some money on it happily instead of feeling nagged from the get-go.</p><p><b>What about subscribers though?</b></p><p>So as not to leave subscribers feeling unappreciated, the game will run a new "subscriber login event" from September to December where you\'ll earn a special currency if you log in at least four times a week, which you can then use to buy some goodies. I kinda raised my eyebrow a bit at one of those goodies supposedly being "endgame gear" but we\'ll see. I really don\'t need more free stuff myself, but I can\'t blame them for trying to offer subscribers a bit more carrot while easing up on the F2P stick.</p><p><b>Say farewell to endless free CC</b></p><p>Speaking of carrots and sticks, regardless of your subscription status, you\'ve long gained 100 free Cartel Coins per month if you\'ve got a security key attached to your account. I often saw delighted comments from people who came back to the game after some time away to find that they\'d accumulated thousands of free Cartel Coins while not playing. While that was nice, considering for how long the game has been running at this point, I can\'t blame the bean counters for concluding that someone coming back after years and immediately finding $40 worth of Cartel Coins in their account was maybe not so good for their bottom line. No, that free CC is not going to go away, but it will only be awarded going forward if your account was actually active in the last 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Decos, Graphics, DirectX</b></p><p>Under "other topics about which I don\'t have that much to say", we have the Feast of Prosperity returning this autumn with some awesome new decos that I\'ll definitely want to grind for. (I actually broke my habit of ignoring Twitch chat to type "LOVE LAMP" when they showed the new ceiling lights.)&nbsp;</p><p>The character customisation updates continue, with Rattataki getting updated textures next, and dark-side corruption getting a much-needed revamp so that it no longer turns every character into a pasty white dude regardless of their previous skin colour. (I might actually give showing it on my dark-siders a try once this goes live - I previously always disabled it precisely because it changed your skin colour <i>so</i> much and I didn\'t want to look like an albino axolotl.) Also, after they added all those skin colours for aliens in the last patch, they are expanding on this by adding more hair and montral colours with 7.7.1.</p><p>Finally, in technical news that I have to file under "I don\'t know enough about this to have an opinion but I guess it sounds good", they are making good progress on updating the game to DirectX 12 but there\'s still some work left to do.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, if you want ALL THE DEETS, including things I didn\'t mention here and images of various rewards, here are some other places you can look:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0E_bwCPnoM">VOD on YouTube</a> (Twitch had some hiccups and split it into several parts)&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/%5Bnews-category%5D/20250730">Official recap article</a></li><li><a href="https://swtorista.com/articles/what-to-expect-in-update-7-7-1-in-swtor-august-2025/">Swtorista</a></li><li><a href="https://todayintor.com/2025/06/28/swtor-7-7-1-update-news/">Today in TOR</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/07/some-interesting-news-from-swtors-771.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/07/some-interesting-news-from-swtors-771.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s72-w400-h249-c/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '10'}

I didn\'t mention it in those posts at the time, but one guildie who ended up popping a particularly large number of tokens to help us achieve victory admitted that she had used a character transfer to shuttle in extra Requisitions from another server, where she\'d been collecting them from her login rewards on the side.</p><p>Now, for additional context, my guild successfully conquered every single available planet at some point over the last decade - with one notable exception: Belsavis.

I\'m not sure why that is, but I can only guess that Belsavis might not come up as often in the rotation as other planets. A planet like Tatooine for example is tied to the Death Mark Conquest event, which in turn is tied to Bounty Contract Week and comes around once a month.

We had a lot of Requisitions saved up, but not <i>that</i> many.</p><p>Anyway, last week\'s Total Galactic War arrived and the matter was brought up again. Looking at the scoreboard, all the biggest guilds had committed early for a change, and the guild in the lead on Belsavis was none other than our frenemies the Czech Empire. They were not a top five guild, and <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/04/at-token-war-with-czech-empire.html">we\'d beaten them before</a>... but it had also been the fight of a lifetime, and they were the reason we were so acutely aware of the power of Personal Conquest Requisitions in the first place, so there was no chance that we\'d be able to surprise them.</p><p>I quickly had a look at possible alternative invasion targets (that we had conquered in the past but that newer members would\'ve liked us to conquer again) but nothing stood out as an easy or obvious option, so after a bit of deliberation I decided to commit us to Belsavis. We agreed that we\'d hold off on using any tokens for now and that we\'d play it by ear, deciding our next steps later in the week depending on how it went.</p><p>Interestingly, it went quite differently than a year ago. Back then, we\'d overtaken the Czechs quickly, and they\'d been quite happy to trail us for the rest of the week with a steady ten million point gap between us. This time, they\'d clearly made a push on launch day to get a solid lead from the beginning, and they did not want us to catch them. We were about three million behind by the end of the first day and I figured that this was a difference we should be able to make up quickly enough, but <i>somehow</i> we couldn\'t quite get there. In fact, by Thursday morning the Czechs had grown their lead to seven million, and by evening we were <i>sixteen</i> million points behind them.</p><p>There was a time when being that far behind would\'ve been reason enough for us to fold, but I knew that the game wasn\'t quite over yet this time, as the other Conquest guy and I - <i>if</i> we went ahead with the server transfers - would have over 50 million points in tokens at our disposal. We did discuss amongst ourselves that if they kept gaining points at the same rate we\'d likely have to give up, but for the time being, we kept going.</p><p>Even though I knew that we had a plan, it was honestly a bit demotivating to keep grinding away when we were so far behind. I heard more than one defeatist comment from guildies but still did my best to counter the psychological warfare. I basically told everyone that we\'d let them know once the battle was lost, but as of now it wasn\'t over yet and they just had to trust me and keep going. (People knew about the saved up Conquest Requisitions, but I didn\'t tell anyone outside the leadership circle about the exact numbers since we\'re not very strict about removing people from our Discord for inactivity, and I was paranoid about information getting leaked to the competition somehow.)</p><p>And it seemed to work! While people weren\'t necessarily in the best of spirits, they kept at it. At its worst, the Czech\'s lead grew to around 18 million points, but they only maintained that for a brief while and most of the time the gap between us seemed to hover between ten and sixteen million.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/s1920/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot of a party fighting the last boss in the Landing Party uprising" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/w400-h225/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Then the weekend came and with it a sudden and unexpected burst of energy. (I think I\'m actually starting to notice a trend here, that my guild is better at Conquest in the second half of the week than in the first half.)</p><p>An officer that had been on hiatus for months popped his head in the door, asked how Total Galactic War was going and quickly ground out a half-million points in one evening. Another guild member who hasn\'t really been playing SWTOR in a while piped up to say that he had the week off and fancied randomly lending us a hand with grinding points. The funniest moment to me personally was when another guy who hadn\'t logged in in months showed up on Monday evening and we had a conversation that went something like this (paraphrased):</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Me: Look at you, logging in for the first time since the last Total Galactic War! [I could tell because on log-in he triggered the "Conqueror of Oricon" achievement.]</li><li>Him: Hah, you got me there. Would you like me to pop some tokens?</li><li>Me: How do you even have any? You haven\'t been online and you said you popped them all last time.</li><li>Him: Oops, I guess I lied.</li></ul><p>All of Sunday afternoon and evening the guild was absolutely buzzing with activity and achievements were popping left and right as people went out of their comfort zone and tried content they hadn\'t done before in order to earn Conquest points. Guild PvP was more active than it had been in months and there was plenty of banter. Point gains aside, it was a joy to see.</p><p>We could see that the Czechs were active in the evening and trying to bolster their score with some planetary rampaging, but we actually had a similar number of people online and were absolutely on fire. By the end of the evening, the gap between us was down to less than ten million.</p><p>I expected Monday to be more quiet, so I was both pleasantly surprised and had a good laugh when I decided to do a quick check-in on Monday morning and saw seven people online in guild. Clearly our members were less constrained by work than I\'d expected.</p><p>We continued Sunday\'s trend at a slightly slower pace and the gap between us and first place continued to shrink all day. By the time the last person went to bed we were only about a million points behind.</p><p>Tuesday I was working from home and I had put a bit of time aside around the end of Conquest to pop my Personal Conquest Requisitions as needed. I had transferred four characters to Darth Malgus the day before (my first character transfers ever) and now held 182 tokens in my inventory and cargo hold. Several other people were online and trying to earn some last-minute points while buzzing with excitement. We were pretty much neck on neck with the Czechs, but still always about a million behind.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/s1920/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot showing my character\'s inventory and an entire cargo bay filled with Personal Conquest Requisitions" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/w400-h225/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>With eight minutes to go on the timer, I decided to start clicking my Requisitions. I\'d told myself that I wasn\'t even going to look at the score, but was just going to keep popping the tokens. We didn\'t really care about overshooting and wasting points, as for us, this was the fight to end all fights. We wanted Belsavis and winning it was all that mattered.</p><p>While I wasn\'t looking at the board, other guildies were, and I was cracking up as several complained about their scoreboard going blank at some point. I\'d like to think that we were pumping so many points into the system that we temporarily overloaded it. Anyway, it turned out that apparently the Czechs did not have a counter to a big final push this time, so I saw guildies cry out "twelve million ahead", "twenty million", "thirty million", "they are not doing anything" and: "Are you still clicking, guys?"&nbsp;</p><p>I eventually stopped with about twenty tokens left in my inventory, though my fellow Conquest buddy used up every last one of his. It had been overkill indeed, as the final scoreboard showed us more than fifty million points ahead of the competition. But it was definitely worth it, as Twin Suns Squadron owned Belsavis at last, earning several of us the "Galaxy Conqueror" legacy title. I think I mentioned before that this isn\'t actually something that\'s hard to get if you simply join a large guild that wins a lot without even trying - it\'s how I got the title on the Shae Vizla server myself. But to have earned it in a smaller guild with hard work and communal effort, over the course of over a decade, that felt pretty good.</p><p>We wondered a bit why the Czechs folded as soon as we started our final offensive, and we can only guess that since the "surprise attack coming from behind" didn\'t work for them last time, they frontloaded more of their efforts (including token pops) this time in order to stay in first place from the beginning (and hopefully demotivate us). They probably didn\'t know that this exact strategy <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/12/living-degen-conquest-life.html">had failed Ace of Saints against us back in December</a> as well, but that\'s how it goes.</p><p>I almost want to say that I feel like I can retire from Conquest, now that I\'ve finally achieved it all, but I honestly enjoy it too much to just give up on it I think. However, any future planetary conquests for newer members admittedly won\'t quite carry the same weight or garner the same amount of excitement as this one did.&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>Last week it was once again time for Total Galactic War.

Point gains aside, it was a joy to see.</p><p>We could see that the Czechs were active in the evening and trying to bolster their score with some planetary rampaging, but we actually had a similar number of people online and were absolutely on fire. By the end of the evening, the gap between us was down to less than ten million.</p><p>I expected Monday to be more quiet, so I was both pleasantly surprised and had a good laugh when I decided to do a quick check-in on Monday morning and saw seven people online in guild. Clearly our members were less constrained by work than I\'d expected.</p><p>We continued Sunday\'s trend at a slightly slower pace and the gap between us and first place continued to shrink all day. By the time the last person went to bed we were only about a million points behind.</p><p>Tuesday I was working from home and I had put a bit of time aside around the end of Conquest to pop my Personal Conquest Requisitions as needed. I had transferred four characters to Darth Malgus the day before (my first character transfers ever) and now held 182 tokens in my inventory and cargo hold. Several other people were online and trying to earn some last-minute points while buzzing with excitement. We were pretty much neck on neck with the Czechs, but still always about a million behind.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/s1920/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot showing my character\'s inventory and an entire cargo bay filled with Personal Conquest Requisitions" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/w400-h225/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>With eight minutes to go on the timer, I decided to start clicking my Requisitions. I\'d told myself that I wasn\'t even going to look at the score, but was just going to keep popping the tokens. We didn\'t really care about overshooting and wasting points, as for us, this was the fight to end all fights. We wanted Belsavis and winning it was all that mattered.</p><p>While I wasn\'t looking at the board, other guildies were, and I was cracking up as several complained about their scoreboard going blank at some point. I\'d like to think that we were pumping so many points into the system that we temporarily overloaded it. Anyway, it turned out that apparently the Czechs did not have a counter to a big final push this time, so I saw guildies cry out "twelve million ahead", "twenty million", "thirty million", "they are not doing anything" and: "Are you still clicking, guys?"&nbsp;</p><p>I eventually stopped with about twenty tokens left in my inventory, though my fellow Conquest buddy used up every last one of his. It had been overkill indeed, as the final scoreboard showed us more than fifty million points ahead of the competition. But it was definitely worth it, as Twin Suns Squadron owned Belsavis at last, earning several of us the "Galaxy Conqueror" legacy title. I think I mentioned before that this isn\'t actually something that\'s hard to get if you simply join a large guild that wins a lot without even trying - it\'s how I got the title on the Shae Vizla server myself. But to have earned it in a smaller guild with hard work and communal effort, over the course of over a decade, that felt pretty good.</p><p>We wondered a bit why the Czechs folded as soon as we started our final offensive, and we can only guess that since the "surprise attack coming from behind" didn\'t work for them last time, they frontloaded more of their efforts (including token pops) this time in order to stay in first place from the beginning (and hopefully demotivate us). They probably didn\'t know that this exact strategy <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/12/living-degen-conquest-life.html">had failed Ace of Saints against us back in December</a> as well, but that\'s how it goes.</p><p>I almost want to say that I feel like I can retire from Conquest, now that I\'ve finally achieved it all, but I honestly enjoy it too much to just give up on it I think. However, any future planetary conquests for newer members admittedly won\'t quite carry the same weight or garner the same amount of excitement as this one did.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/06/conquest-of-parison-planet.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/06/conquest-of-parison-planet.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiynfkO8DKwSt-WV0hG4eCNCQHK67LN3Ciwtoh_E47mPQ0n_VffdqsaVZl_Vz8lh2fdaky2xqnWCnUA274GdLMzvzara6euEjX0vMSXG2poRELBn718-BblOF9zy1fTUKadZu0EaIxcDhIrueM9ZWualWypASkgD0GKjP8-2ZObDy0dB9Q4zPLZ_J-e3EY/s72-w400-h225-c/Shintar%20on%20Belsavis%20with%20Galaxy%20Conqueror%20legacy%20title.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '5'}

This makes sense in so far as they fill a similar niche and the DEs were the new hotness, but it also meant that what previously made this objective so much fun to do - that it was so varied in its locations and could be done in a number of different ways - was kind of lost as we were just stuck on either Tatooine or Hoth week after week.</p><p>We\'ll see how they\'ll handle this in future seasons, but I think my personal preference would be if they simply merged the two types of objectives together, into something like "Complete Dynamic Encounters, Repeatable, Exploration, or Bonus Missions while defeating enemies on Coruscant or Dromund Kaas", therefore restoring the "rotating between different planets" aspect while also including dynamic encounters in the mix.</p><p>Still, I\'ve got to admit I\'m going to try and temper my expectations for whenever they announce Galactic Season 9, because I\'m definitely a bit bored of the repetition and lack of even small bits of newness at this point.

I think most raiders would posit that for them, raiding is about some sort of progression: seeing the content, beating the challenge, getting the gear... and once you\'ve hit your goal, you move on.</p><p>SWTOR doesn\'t really support that kind of attitude towards raiding anymore, or at least not if you\'re a long-term player. If you\'re coming to the game completely fresh, there\'s plenty to do and many encounters to work your way through, thanks to scaling keeping all the old content relevant, but new operations come out way too infrequently to keep existing players busy for very long.</p><p>I sometimes find myself wondering why I\'m still so focused on that part of the game after more than a decade to be honest. I\'ve seen all there is to see, many times, and while my skill at the game has improved over the years from sheer repetition, if I haven\'t been able to beat a higher-difficulty encounter that\'s been in the game for over a decade at this point, I\'m not holding my breath that it\'s still going to happen.</p><p>I guess it\'s just a habit, a way of hanging out a few times a week, and the fact that Mr Commando and I do it together has led to a sort of feedback loop where we keep each other going even if one person\'s interest flags at some point.</p><p>That said, there\'s been turnover in the people we raid <i>with</i> over the years, and every now and then we\'ll get some fresh faces who haven\'t yet seen it all and who\'ll be excited to tackle this or that operation for the first time, and I\'ll be like "sure", because what else am I going to suggest?</p><p>In line with that we cleared Dread Palace master mode again a couple of months ago, and it actually went so quickly and smoothly (considering that some people had never done it before), that I found myself daring to hope for some personal progression for the first time in a while, because I\'d never gotten the achievement for the timed run, which requires you to clear the instance within an hour.</p><p>Everyone was game for working on it, so we kept going back every week, just to get better at the fights and progress that little bit more quickly, with fewer wipes along the way. Progression was far from smooth, as some nights would see us one-shot the first four bosses in a timely manner just to keep failing on the final Council fight, while on others, we would mess up repeatedly at the very beginning and then never even finish the instance.</p><p>However, improvement did happen, and this Wednesday we finally got there. We were actually off to a very bad start at first and wiped twice on the very first encounter.

I think most raiders would posit that for them, raiding is about some sort of progression: seeing the content, beating the challenge, getting the gear... and once you\'ve hit your goal, you move on.</p><p>SWTOR doesn\'t really support that kind of attitude towards raiding anymore, or at least not if you\'re a long-term player. If you\'re coming to the game completely fresh, there\'s plenty to do and many encounters to work your way through, thanks to scaling keeping all the old content relevant, but new operations come out way too infrequently to keep existing players busy for very long.</p><p>I sometimes find myself wondering why I\'m still so focused on that part of the game after more than a decade to be honest. I\'ve seen all there is to see, many times, and while my skill at the game has improved over the years from sheer repetition, if I haven\'t been able to beat a higher-difficulty encounter that\'s been in the game for over a decade at this point, I\'m not holding my breath that it\'s still going to happen.</p><p>I guess it\'s just a habit, a way of hanging out a few times a week, and the fact that Mr Commando and I do it together has led to a sort of feedback loop where we keep each other going even if one person\'s interest flags at some point.</p><p>That said, there\'s been turnover in the people we raid <i>with</i> over the years, and every now and then we\'ll get some fresh faces who haven\'t yet seen it all and who\'ll be excited to tackle this or that operation for the first time, and I\'ll be like "sure", because what else am I going to suggest?</p><p>In line with that we cleared Dread Palace master mode again a couple of months ago, and it actually went so quickly and smoothly (considering that some people had never done it before), that I found myself daring to hope for some personal progression for the first time in a while, because I\'d never gotten the achievement for the timed run, which requires you to clear the instance within an hour.</p><p>Everyone was game for working on it, so we kept going back every week, just to get better at the fights and progress that little bit more quickly, with fewer wipes along the way. Progression was far from smooth, as some nights would see us one-shot the first four bosses in a timely manner just to keep failing on the final Council fight, while on others, we would mess up repeatedly at the very beginning and then never even finish the instance.</p><p>However, improvement did happen, and this Wednesday we finally got there. We were actually off to a very bad start at first and wiped twice on the very first encounter.

[...] not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which [everyone] shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position&#x201d;</blockquote><p>I wanted to know what these words meant to us today. I needed to know what parts of the American Dream we all still had in common. I had to make some sense of what was happening to our country. I&#x2019;ve been writing on my blog since 2004, and on November 7th, I started writing the most difficult piece I have ever written. </p><p>I asked so many Americans to tell me what the American Dream personally meant to them, and I wrote it all down.</p><p>Later in November, I attended a theater performance of The Outsiders at my son&#x2019;s public high school &#x2013; an adaptation of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1742507328643679&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GgwTbUV3qWhPvsHuYFgy7" rel="noreferrer">the 1967 novel by S.E. Hinton</a>. All I really knew was the famous &#x201c;stay gold&#x201d; line from the 1983 movie. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what &#x201c;stay gold&#x201d; meant: <em>sharing the American Dream.</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="2894" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_7003.jpg" width="2000" /></figure><p>We cannot merely attain the Dream. The dream is incomplete until we share it with our fellow Americans. That act of sharing is the final realization of everything the dream stands for.</p><p>Thanks to S.E. Hinton, I finally had a name for my essay, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/" rel="noreferrer">&#x201c;Stay Gold, America.&#x201d;</a> I published it on January 7th, with a <strong>Pledge to Share the American Dream</strong>.</p><p>In the first part of the Pledge, the short term, our family made eight 1 million dollar donations to the following nonprofit groups: <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.org/" rel="noreferrer">Team Rubicon</a>, <a href="https://childrenshungerfund.org/" rel="noreferrer">Children&#x2019;s Hunger Fund</a>, <a href="https://pen.org/">PEN America</a>, <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/" rel="noreferrer">The Trevor Project</a>, <a href="https://www.naacpldf.org/" rel="noreferrer">NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.firstgenerationinvestors.com/" rel="noreferrer">First Generation Investors</a>, <a href="https://www.globalrefuge.org/" rel="noreferrer">Global Refuge</a>, and <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/" rel="noreferrer">Planned Parenthood</a>. </p><p>Beyond that, we made many additional one million dollar donations to reinforce our technical infrastructure in America &#x2013; <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://archive.org" rel="noreferrer">The Internet Archive</a>, <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/" rel="noreferrer">The Common Crawl Foundation</a>, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="noreferrer">Let&#x2019;s Encrypt</a>, pioneering independent internet journalism, and several other crucial open source software infrastructure projects that power much of the world today.</p><p>I encourage every American to <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/" rel="noreferrer">contribute soon</a>, however you can, to organizations you feel are effectively helping those most currently in need.</p><p>But short term fixes are not enough.</p><p>The <strong>Pledge To Share The American Dream</strong> requires a much more ambitious second act &#x2013; deeper, long term changes that will take decades. Over the next five years, my family pledges half our remaining wealth to plant a seed toward foundational long term efforts ensuring that all Americans continue to have the same fair access to the American Dream.</p><p>Let me tell you about my own path to the American Dream. It was rocky. My parents were born into deep poverty in Mercer County, West Virginia, and Beaufort County, North Carolina. Our family eventually clawed our way to the bottom of the middle class in Virginia. </p><p>I won&#x2019;t dwell on it, but every family has their own problems. We did not remain middle class for long. But through all this, my parents got the most important thing right: they loved me openly and unconditionally. That is everything. It&#x2019;s the only reason I am standing here in front of you today.</p><p>With my family&#x2019;s support, I managed to achieve a solid public education in Chesterfield County, Virginia, and had the incredible privilege of an affordable state education at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/aboutuva/" rel="noreferrer">University of Virginia</a>. This is a college uniquely rooted in the beliefs of one of the most prominent Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson. He was a living paradox. A man of profound ideals and yet flawed &#x2013; trapped in the values of his time and place. </p><p>Still, he wrote &#x201c;Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&#x201d; at the top of the Declaration of Independence. These words were, and still are, revolutionary. They define our fundamental shared American values, although we have not always lived up to them. The American Dream isn&#x2019;t about us succeeding, alone, by ourselves, but about connecting with each other and succeeding together as Americans.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been concerned about wealth concentration in America ever since I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM" rel="noreferrer">2012 video by politizane</a> illustrating just how extreme wealth concentration already was. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>I had no idea how close we were to the American Gilded Age from the late 1800s. This period was given a name in the 1920s by historians referencing Mark Twain&#x2019;s 1873 novel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gilded_Age:_A_Tale_of_Today" rel="noreferrer">The Gilded Age, A Tale of Today</a>. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="800" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-151.png" width="1200" /></figure><p>During this time, labor strikes often turned violent, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike" rel="noreferrer">Homestead Strike of 1892</a> resulting in deadly confrontations between workers and Pinkerton guards hired by factory owners. Rapid industrialization created hazardous working conditions in factories, mines, and railroads, where thousands died due to insufficient safety regulations and employers who prioritized profit over worker welfare.</p><p>In January 2025, while I was still writing <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/" rel="noreferrer">&#x201c;Stay Gold, America&#x201d;</a>, we entered the period of greatest wealth concentration in the entirety of American history. As of 2021, the <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-this-chart-explains-americans-wealth-across-income-levels/" rel="noreferrer">top 1% of households controlled 32% of all wealth</a>, while the bottom 50% only have 2.6%. It&#x2019;s difficult to find more recent data, but wealth concentration has only intensified in the last four years.</p><p>We can no longer say &#x201c;Gilded Age.&#x201d;</p><p>We must now say &#x201c;The First Gilded Age.&#x201d;</p><p>Today, in our <em>second</em> Gilded Age, more and more people find their path to the American Dream blocked. When Americans face unaffordable education, lack of accessible healthcare, or lack affordable housing, they aren&#x2019;t just disadvantaged &#x2013; they&#x2019;re trapped, often burdened by massive debt. They have no stable foundation to build their lives. They watch desperately, working as hard as they can, while life simply passes them by, without even the freedom to choose their own lives.</p><p>They don&#x2019;t have time to build a career. They don&#x2019;t have time to learn, to improve. They don&#x2019;t get to start a business. They can&#x2019;t choose where their kids will grow up, or whether to have children at all, because they can&#x2019;t afford to. Here in the land of opportunity, the pursuit of happiness has become an endless task for too many. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="1141" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-152.png" width="1178" /></figure><p>We are denying people any real chance of achieving the dream that we promised them &#x2013; that we promised the entire world &#x2013; when we founded this nation. It is such a profound betrayal of everything we ever dreamed about. Without a stable foundation to build a life on, our fellow Americans cannot even <em>pursue</em> the American Dream, much less achieve it.</p><p>I ask you this: as an American, what is the purpose of a dream left unshared with so many for so long? What&#x2019;s happening to our dream? Are we really willing to let go of our values so easily? We&#x2019;re Americans. We fight for our values, the values embodied in our dream, the ones we founded this country on. </p><p>Why aren&#x2019;t we sharing the American Dream? </p><p>Why aren&#x2019;t we giving everyone a fair chance at Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness by providing them the fundamentals they need to get there?</p><p>The Dream worked for me, decades ago, and I deeply believe that the American Dream can still work for everyone &#x2013; if we ensure every American has the same fair chance we did. The American Dream was never about a few people being extraordinarily wealthy. It&#x2019;s about everyone having an equal chance to succeed and pursue their dreams &#x2013; their own happiness. It belongs to them. I think we owe them at least that. I think we owe <em>ourselves</em> at least that.</p><p>What can we do about this? There are no easy answers. I can&#x2019;t even pretend to have the answer, because there isn&#x2019;t any one answer to give. Nothing worth doing is ever that simple. But I can tell you this: all the studies and all the data I&#x2019;ve looked at have strongly pointed to one foundational thing we can do here in America over the next five years.</p><p>Natalie Foster, co-founder of the <a href="https://economicsecurityproject.org/" rel="noreferrer">Economic Security Project</a>, makes a powerful case for the idea that, with all this concentrated wealth, we can offer a <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income</strong> in the poorest areas of this country &#x2013; the areas of most need, where money goes the farthest &#x2013; to unlock vast amounts of untapped American potential. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1620978466/"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="700" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/the-guarantee-book-natalie-foster-1.jpg" width="467" /></a></figure><p>This isn&#x2019;t a new idea. We&#x2019;ve been doing this a while now in different forms, but we never called it Guaranteed Minimum Income.</p><p>In <strong>1797</strong>, Thomas Paine proposed a retirement pension funded by estate taxes. It didn&#x2019;t go anywhere, but it planted a seed. Much later we implemented the Social Security Act in <strong>1935</strong> . The economic chaos of the Great Depression coupled with the inability of private philanthropy to provide economic security inspired Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s New Deal government programs. The most popular and effective program to emerge from this era was Social Security, providing a guaranteed income for retirees. Before Social Security, <em>half</em> of seniors lived in poverty. Today only 10% of seniors live in poverty.</p><p>In his <strong>1967</strong> book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Go_from_Here:_Chaos_or_Community%3F" rel="noreferrer">Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community</a>, Martin Luther King Jr made the moral case for a form of UBI, Universal Basic Income. King believed that economic insecurity was at the root of all inequality. He stated that a guaranteed income &#x2014; direct cash disbursements &#x2014; was the simplest and best way to fight poverty.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="1401" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-147.png" width="1920" /></figure><p>In <strong>1972</strong>, Congress established the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, providing direct cash assistance to low-income elderly, blind, and disabled individuals with little or no income. This cash can be used for food, housing, and medical expenses, the essentials for financial stability. As of January, 2025, over 7.3 million people receive SSI benefits.</p><p>In <strong>1975</strong>, Congress passed the Tax Reduction Act, establishing the Earned Income Tax Credit. This tax credit benefits working-class parents with children, encouraging work by increasing the income of low-income workers. In 2023, it lifted about 6.4 million people out of poverty, including 3.4 million children. <a href="https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.pdf" rel="noreferrer">According to the Census Bureau</a>, it is the second most effective anti-poverty tool after Social Security.</p><p>In <strong>2019</strong>, directly inspired by King, mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tubbs" rel="noreferrer">Michael Tubbs</a> &#x2013; at age 26, one of the youngest mayors in American history &#x2013; launched the $3 million <a href="https://www.stocktondemonstration.org/" rel="noreferrer">Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration</a>. It provided 125 residents with $500 per month in unconditional cash payments for two years. The program found that recipients experienced improved financial stability, increased full-time employment, and enhanced well-being.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="800" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-150.png" width="1200" /><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Michael Tubbs, Former Mayor of Stockton, on </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rSQCNd0Dr8" rel="noreferrer"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Creating a California for All</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>In my &#x201c;Stay Gold, America&#x201d; blog post, I referenced the Robert Frost &#x201c;Stay Gold&#x201d; poem and S.E. Hinton&#x2019;s famous famous novel The Outsiders, urging us to retain our youthful ideals as we grow older. Ideals embodied in the American Dream.</p><p>Which brings us to another Robert Frost poem, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken" rel="noreferrer">The Road Not Taken</a>. Our proposal to ensure access to the American Dream is to follow the path less travelled by:  <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income. </strong>GMI is a simpler, more practical, more scalable plan to directly address the root of economic insecurity with minimum bureaucracy.</p><p>We are partnering with GiveDirectly, who oversaw <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/united-states/" rel="noreferrer">the most GMI studies</a> in the United States, and OpenResearch, who just completed the <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/study" rel="noreferrer">largest, most detailed GMI study</a> ever conducted in this country in 2023. We are working together to launch a new Guaranteed Minimum Income initiative in <strong>rural American communities</strong>.</p><p>Network effects within communities explain why equality of opportunity is so effective, and why a shared American Dream is the most powerful dream of all. The potential of the American Dream becomes vastly greater as more people have access to it, <strong>because<em> they share it</em><em>.</em></strong></p><p>They share it with their families, their friends, and their neighbors. The groundbreaking, massive <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/documentation" rel="noreferrer">2023 OpenResearch UBI study data</a> showed that when you give money to the poorest among us, they consistently go <em>out</em> <em>of their way</em> to share that money with others in desperate need.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/documentation"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="966" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/openresearch-ubi-study-expenditures.png" width="1719" /></a></figure><p>The power of opportunity is not in what it can do for one person, but how it connects and strengthens bonds between people. When you empower a couple, you allow them to build a family. When you empower families, you allow them to build a community. When you guarantee fundamentals, you&#x2019;re providing a foundation for those connections to grow and thrive. This is the incredible power and value of community. That is what we are investing in &#x2013; each other.</p><p>A system where there are no guarantees creates conflict. It creates inequality. A massive concentration of wealth in so few hands weakens connections between us and prevents new ones. America began as a place of connection. Millions of us came together to build this nation, not individually, but together. Equality is connection, and connection is more valuable than any product any company will ever sell you.</p><p>Why focus on rural communities? There are consistently higher poverty rates in rural counties, with fewer job opportunities, lower wages, and worse access to healthcare and education. It&#x2019;s not a new problem, either &#x2014; places like Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, and American Indian reservations have been stuck in poverty for decades, with some counties like Oglala Lakota, SD (55.8%) and McDowell, WV (37.6%) hitting extreme levels. Meanwhile, urban counties rarely see numbers that high. The data from the US Census and USDA Economic Research Service make it clear: if you&#x2019;re poor in America, being rural makes it even harder to escape.</p><p>Rural areas also offer smaller populations, which is helpful because we need to start small with lots of tightly controlled studies that we can carefully scale and improve on for larger areas. We hope to build a large body of scientific data showing that GMI really does improve the lives, and the communities, of our fellow Americans.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="1067" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-149.png" width="1600" /></figure><h3 id="the-initial-plan-is-to-target-a-few-counties-that-i-have-a-personal-connection-to-and-are-still-currently-in-poverty-decades-later">The initial plan is to target a few counties that I have a personal connection to, and are still currently in poverty, decades later:</h3><ul><li>My father was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_County,_West_Virginia" rel="noreferrer">Mercer County</a>, West Virginia, where the collapse of coal mining left good people struggling to survive. Their living and their way of life is now all but gone, and good jobs are hard to find.</li><li>My mother&#x2019;s birthplace, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_County,_North_Carolina" rel="noreferrer">Beaufort County</a>, North Carolina, has been hit just as hard, with farming and factory jobs disappearing and families left wondering what&#x2019;s next.</li><li>Our third county is yet to be decided, but will be a community also facing the same systemic, generational obstacles to economic stability and achieving the American Dream.</li></ul><p>We will work with existing local groups to coordinate GMI studies where community members choose to enroll. We will conduct outreach and and provide mentorship to these opt-in study participants. It will be teamwork between Americans.</p><p>We hope Veterans will play a crucial role in our effort. We plan to work with local communities and veteran-serving organizations to engage veterans to support and execute our GMI programs &#x2013; the same veterans who served our country with distinction, returning home with exceptional leadership skills and a deep commitment to their communities. Their involvement ensures these programs reflect core American values of self-reliance and community service to fellow Americans. </p><p>We&#x2019;ll also partner with established community organizations &#x2014; churches, civic groups, community colleges, local businesses. These partnerships help integrate our GMI studies with existing support systems, rather than creating new ones.</p><p><a href="https://givedirectly.org/" rel="noreferrer">GiveDirectly</a> and <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/study" rel="noreferrer">OpenResearch</a> will build on their existing body of work, gathering extensive data from these refined studies. We&#x2019;ll measure employment, entrepreneurship, education, health, and community engagement. We&#x2019;ll conduct regular interviews with participants to understand their experience. How is this working for you? How can we make it better? You tell us. How can we make it better together?</p><p>Economic security isn&#x2019;t only about individual well-being &#x2013; it&#x2019;s the bedrock of democracy. When people aren&#x2019;t constantly worried about feeding themselves, feeding their family, having decent healthcare, having a place to live&#x2026; we have given them room to breathe. We have given them freedom. The freedom to raise their children, the freedom to start businesses, the freedom to choose where they work, the freedom to volunteer... the freedom to <em>vote</em>.</p><p>This isn&#x2019;t about ideology or government. It&#x2019;s about us, as Americans, working together to invest in our future &#x2013; possibly the greatest unlocking of human potential in our entire history. I do not say these things lightly. I&#x2019;ve seen it work. I&#x2019;ve looked at all the existing study data. A little bit of money is incredibly transformational for people in poverty &#x2013; the people who need it the most &#x2013; the people who cannot live up to their potential because they&#x2019;re so busy simply trying to survive. Imagine what they could do if we gave them just a little breathing room.</p><p>GMI is a long term investment in the future of what America should be, the way we wrote it down in the Declaration of Independence, perhaps incompletely &#x2013; but our democracy was always meant to be malleable, to change, to adapt, and improve.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="800" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-148.png" width="1200" /></figure><p>I&#x2019;d like to conclude by mentioning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz" rel="noreferrer">Aaron Swartz</a>. He was a precocious teenage programmer much like myself. Aaron helped develop RSS web feeds, co-founded Reddit, and worked with Creative Commons to create flexible copyright licenses for the common good. He used technology to make information universally accessible to everyone.</p><p>Aaron created a system to download public domain court documents from PACER, a government database that charged fees for accessing what he believed should be freely available public information. A few years later, while visiting MIT under their open campus policy and as a research fellow at Harvard, he used MIT&#x2019;s network to download millions of academic articles from JSTOR, another fee-charging online academic journal repository, intending to make this knowledge freely accessible. Since taxpayers had funded much of this research, why shouldn&#x2019;t that knowledge be freely available to everyone?</p><p>What Aaron saw as an act of academic freedom and information equality, authorities viewed as a crime&#x2014;he was arrested in January 2011 and charged with multiple felonies for what many considered to be nothing more than accessing knowledge that should have been freely available to the public in the first place.</p><p>Despite JSTOR declining to pursue charges and MIT eventually calling for leniency, federal prosecutors aggressively pursued felony charges against Aaron with up to 35 years in prison. Facing overwhelming legal pressure and the prospect of being labeled a felon, Aaron took his own life at 26. This sparked widespread criticism of prosecutorial overreach and prompted discussions about open access to information. Deservedly so. Eight days later, in this very hall, there was a standing room only memorial service praising Aaron for his commitment to the public good.</p><p>Aaron pursued what was right for we, the people. He chose to build the public good despite knowing there would be risks. He chose to be an activist. I think we should all choose to be activists, to be brave, to stand up for our defining American principles. </p><h2 id="there-are-two-things-i-ask-of-you-today">There are two things I ask of you today.</h2><ol><li>Visit <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/rural-us/">givedirectly.org/rural-us</a> where we&#x2019;ll be documenting our journey and findings from the initial three GMI rural county studies. Let&#x2019;s find out together how guaranteed minimum income can transform American lives.</li><li>Talk about <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income</strong> in your communities. Meet with your state and local officials. Share the existing study data. Share outcomes. Ask them about conducting GMI studies like ours in your area. We tell ourselves stories about why some people succeed and others don&#x2019;t. Challenge those stories. Economic security is not <em>charity</em>. It is an <em>investment</em> in vast untapped American potential in the poorest areas of this country.</li></ol><p>My family is committing 50 million dollars to this endeavor, but imagine if we had even more to share. Imagine how much more we could do, if we build this together, starting today. Decades from now, people will look back and wonder why it took us so long to share our dream of a better, richer, and fuller life with our fellow Americans.</p><p>I hope you join us on this grand experiment to share our American Dream. I believe everyone deserves a fair chance at what was promised when we founded this nation: Life, Liberty, and <em>the pursuit of The American Dream.</em></p>'}]}

It takes hard conversations that ask us to confront where we&#x2019;ve been, where we are, and who we want to be.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m incredibly honored to be joining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Vindman" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Alexander Vindman</strong></a> in giving a talk at the historic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union" rel="noreferrer">Cooper Union Great Hall</a> 14 days from now. I greatly admire the way Colonel Vindman was willing to put everything on the line to defend the ideals of democracy and the American Dream.</p><p>The American Dream is, at its core, the promise that hard work, fairness, and opportunity can lead to a better future. But in 2025, that promise feels like a question: <strong>How can we build on our dream so that it works for everyone?</strong></p><p>Alexander and I will explore this in our joint talk through the lens of democracy, community, and economic mobility. We come from very different backgrounds, but we strongly share the belief that everyone&apos;s American Dream is worth fighting for.</p><p>Alexander Vindman has lived many lifetimes of standing up for what&apos;s right. He was born in the Soviet Union and immigrated to the U.S. as a child, growing up in Brooklyn before enlisting in the U.S. Army. Over the next 21 years, he served with distinction, earning a Purple Heart for injuries sustained in Iraq and eventually rising to Director of European Affairs for the National Security Council. When asked to choose between looking the other way or upholding the values he swore to protect, he chose correctly. That decision cost him his career but never his integrity. I have a lot to learn about what civic duty truly means from Alex.</p><p>I build things on the Internet, like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://discourse.org/" rel="noreferrer">Discourse</a>. I write on the internet, on this blog. I&apos;ve spent years thinking about how people interact online, how communities work (or don&apos;t), and how we create digital spaces that encourage fairness, participation, and constructive discourse. Spaces that result in artifacts for the common good, like local parks, where everyone can enjoy them together. Whether you&apos;re running a country or running a forum, the same rules seem to apply: people need clear expectations, fair systems, strong boundaries, and a shared sense of purpose. </p><p>This is the part of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/" rel="noreferrer">Stay Gold</a> I couldn&apos;t tell you about, not yet, because I was working so hard to figure it out. How do you make long-term structural change that creates opportunity for everyone? It is an incredibly complex problem. But if we focus our efforts in a particular area, I believe we can change a lot of things in this country. Maybe not everything, but something foundational to the next part of our history as a country: <strong>how to move beyond individual generosity and toward systems that create security, dignity, and possibility for all</strong>.</p><p>I can&apos;t promise easy answers, but what I can promise is an honest, unfiltered conversation about how we move forward, with specifics. Colonel Vindman brings the perspective of someone who embodied American ideals, and I bring the experience of building self-governing digital communities that scale, which turned out to be far more relevant to the future of democracy than I ever would have dreamed possible.</p><p>Imagine what we can do if Alex and I work together.

My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn&#x2019;t forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. <br /><br />My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. <strong>They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. </strong></p><p>I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p><p>During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history" rel="noreferrer">federal minimum wage</a>, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with <a href="https://www.salliemae.com/blog/in-state-vs-out-of-state-tuition/" rel="noreferrer">lower in-state tuition</a>, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-year" rel="noreferrer">College tuition</a> at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years. These huge cost increases for healthcare, education, and housing are not compatible with the American Dream.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/chart-of-the-day-or-century-8/"><img alt="Stay Gold, America" class="kg-image" height="1141" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/consumer-price-increases-2020-2022.png" width="1178" /></a></figure><p>Programmers all over the world helped make an American Dream happen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080703183923/http://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noreferrer">in 2008</a> when we built <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a>, a Q&amp;A website for programmers creating a shared <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en" rel="noreferrer">Creative Commons</a> knowledge base for the world. We did it democratically, because that&#x2019;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_way" rel="noreferrer">American way</a>. We voted to rank questions and answers, and held elections for community moderators using <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked-choice_voting_in_the_United_States" rel="noreferrer">ranked choice voting</a>. We built a <strong>digital democracy</strong> &#x2013; of the programmers, by the programmers, for the programmers. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vijaygurbaxani/2021/06/08/the-18-billion-acquisition-of-stack-overflow-aims-to-turbocharge-the-worlds-software-knowhow/" rel="noreferrer">It worked</a>. <br /><br />With the guidance of my co-founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky" rel="noreferrer">Joel Spolsky</a>, I came to understand that the digital democracy of Stack Overflow was not enough. We must be brave enough to actively, openly share love with each other. That became the foundation for <a href="https://discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, a free, open source tool for constructive, empathetic community discussions that are also Creative Commons. We can disagree in those discussions because Discourse empowers communities to set <a href="https://frameshiftconsulting.com/2017/09/10/the-intolerable-speech-rule-the-paradox-of-tolerance-for-tech-companies" rel="noreferrer">boundaries the community agrees on</a>, providing tools to democratically govern and strongly moderate by enforcing these boundaries. <strong>Digital democracy <em>and empathy</em>,</strong> for everyone.</p><p>In order for digital democracy to work, we need to see each other through our screens.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://xkcd.com/438/"><img alt="Stay Gold, America" class="kg-image" height="253" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-240.png" width="382" /></a></figure><p>We often behave online <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/they-have-to-be-monsters/"><u>in ways we never would</u></a> in the real world because we cannot see the person on the other side of the screen.

I probably couldn&#x2019;t have accomplished this in any other country, and I was rewarded handsomely for a combination of hard work and good luck.

I earned millions of dollars. I thought that was the final part of the American Dream. But it wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>I recently attended a theater performance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)">The Outsiders</a> at my son&#x2019;s public high school. All I really knew was the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f46JMzVzSB4" rel="noreferrer">&#x201c;stay gold&#x201d; line</a> from the 1983 movie adaptation. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant: <a href="http://blog.asjournal.org/the-american-dream-reconsidered-the-outsiders-1967/" rel="noreferrer"><em>sharing</em> the American Dream</a>. </p><p>In the printed program, the director wrote:</p><blockquote>This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. <br /><br />We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and <strong>connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity</strong>. Whether you&#x2019;ve read this story recently, long ago, or not at all, I hope you are able to find inspiration in the strength and passion of youth. Thank you for being part of this journey with us.<br /><br /><a href="https://poets.org/poem/nothing-gold-can-stay"><strong>Stay gold</strong></a><strong>.</strong></blockquote><p>I <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/im-loyal-to-nothing-except-the-dream/" rel="noreferrer">believe deeply</a> in sharing The American Dream. It is the foundation of our country, the second paragraph in our <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript" rel="noreferrer">Declaration of Independence</a>, written by the founder of the public university I attended:</p><blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</blockquote><p>But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rewinding-jimi-hendrixs-national-anthem" rel="noreferrer">captured this distortion</a> so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>We are still trying to live up to those ideals today. In November 2024, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election" rel="noreferrer">enough of us voted</a> for people who interpret the dream in a way that I don&#x2019;t understand.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Stay Gold, America" class="kg-image" height="534" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-241.png" width="618" /></figure><p>34% of adults in America did <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-2024-our-very-complicated-democracy/election-2024-why-americans-dont-vote-episode-6.html" rel="noreferrer">not exercise their right to vote</a>. Why? Is it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States" rel="noreferrer">voter suppression</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering" rel="noreferrer">gerrymandering</a> causing indifference, or people who felt their vote didn&#x2019;t matter? The 7.6% that are ineligible to vote are mostly adults living in America who have not managed to attain citizenship, or people <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights" rel="noreferrer">convicted of a felony</a>. Whatever the reasons, 42% of adults living in America had no say in the 2024 election. The vote <a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/" rel="noreferrer">failed to represent everyone</a>.</p><p>I think many of the Americans who did vote are telling us they no longer believe our government is effectively <em>keeping America fair for everyone</em>. Our status as the <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/ethics-leadership/democracy-index" rel="noreferrer">world&#x2019;s leading democracy</a> is in question. We should make it easier for more eligible Americans to vote, such as <strong>making election day a </strong><a href="https://www.actforamerica.org/act-now/Make-Election-Day-a-National-Holiday" rel="noreferrer"><strong>national holiday</strong></a><strong>, universal </strong><a href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/issues/universal-mailed-ballots#issues_map" rel="noreferrer"><strong>mail in voting</strong></a><strong>, and adopting </strong><a href="https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>ranked choice voting</strong></a> so all votes carry more weight. We should also strengthen institutions keeping democracy fair for everyone, such as state and local election boards, as well as the Federal Election Commission.<br /><br />It was only after I attained the dream that I was able to fully see how many Americans have so very little. This much wealth starts to unintentionally distance my family from other Americans. I no longer bother to look at how much items cost, because <em>I don&#x2019;t have to</em>. We don&#x2019;t have to think about all these things that are challenging or unreachable for so many others. The more wealth you attain, the more unmistakably clear it becomes how unequal life is for so many of us.<br /><br />Even with the wealth I have, I can&#x2019;t imagine what it would feel like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/democrats-harris-billionaire-mistake/680779/" rel="noreferrer">to be a billionaire</a><em>.</em> <strong>It is, for lack of a better word, </strong><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>unamerican</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>In 2012, the top 1% of Americans held 24% of our country&#x2019;s wealth. By 2021, the top 1% of Americans held 30%.  So many have so little, while a tiny few have massive, wildly disproportionate wealth, which keeps growing. Now the global top 1% hold nearly <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/richest-1-bag-nearly-twice-much-wealth-rest-world-put-together-over-past-two-years" rel="noreferrer">twice as much wealth</a> as the rest of the world combined.<br /><br />I grew up poor in America, inspired by the promise of the American Dream that I could better myself and my family by building things that <em>mattered</em>:</p><blockquote>Work is service, not gain. The object of work is life, not income. The reward of production is plenty, not private fortune. We should measure the prosperity of a nation not by the number of millionaires, but by<strong> the absence of poverty, the prevalence of health, the efficiency of the public schools, </strong>and the number of people who can and do read worthwhile books<strong>. </strong>&#x2013; <a href="https://credo.library.umass.edu/view/full/mums312-b203-i031" rel="noreferrer">Du Bois</a></blockquote><p>Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#Types" rel="noreferrer">version of capitalism</a> delivered so much wealth to my family for my hard work in co-founding two successful companies. My partner and I gladly paid our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States" rel="noreferrer">full taxes</a>, and we always planned to give most of our remaining wealth to charities when we pass, following the <a href="https://givingpledge.org/pledger?pledgerId=177" rel="noreferrer">Warren Buffett Philanthropic Pledge</a>:</p><blockquote>More than 99% of my wealth will go to philanthropy during my lifetime or at death.</blockquote><p>I admire Buffett, but even having only a tiny fraction of his $325 billion fortune, to me this pledge was incomplete. When would this wealth be transferred? </p><p>Last year he <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/06/28/investing/warren-buffett-gates-donation" rel="noreferrer">amended the pledge</a>, giving all his wealth at death to a charitable trust run by his children, aged 71, 69, and 66, who <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/01/warren-buffett-pledge-100-billion" rel="noreferrer">do not make for natural charitable bedfellows</a>. I am only holding back enough wealth for my children so they can afford college educations and buy a home. I am compelled to, because being a parent is <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/on-parenthood/" rel="noreferrer">the toughest job I&#x2019;ve ever had</a>, and I am concerned about their future.</p><p>November 5th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election" rel="noreferrer">raised the stakes</a>. It is now time to allocate <strong>half the wealth</strong> I was so fortunate to be dealt within the next five years<strong>,</strong> not just for my own family, but for all my fellow Americans. </p><p>Our government seems to be slower and slower at delivering change due to the increased <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en" rel="noreferrer">polarization of our two party system</a>.

In an informal conversation, Fermi noted no convincing evidence of this, nor any signs of alien intelligence anywhere in the observable universe, leading him to ask, &#x201c;Where is everybody?&#x201d;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>To me, this is a compelling argument, in the same way that&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel?ref=codinghorror.obox.agency#Absence_of_time_travelers_from_the_future" rel="noopener noreferrer">the lack of evidence of any time travellers</a>&#xa0;is:</p><blockquote>Many have argued that the absence of time travelers from the future demonstrates that such technology will never be developed, suggesting that it is impossible. This is analogous to the Fermi paradox related to the absence of evidence of extraterrestrial life. As the absence of extraterrestrial visitors does not categorically prove they do not exist, so the absence of time travelers fails to prove time travel is physically impossible; it might be that time travel is physically possible but is never developed or is cautiously used. Carl Sagan once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers.</blockquote><p>It seems, to me at least, clear evidence that time travel is not possible, given the enormous amount of time behind us. Something, somewhere, would certainly have invented it by now... right?</p><p>So if not, what happened? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Great Filter</a>&#xa0;maybe?</p><blockquote>The Great Filter theory says that at some point from pre-life to Type III intelligence, there&#x2019;s a wall that all or nearly all attempts at life hit. There&#x2019;s some stage in that long evolutionary process that is extremely unlikely or impossible for life to get beyond. That stage is The Great Filter.</blockquote><p>I liked&#xa0;Wait But Why&#x2019;s take on this&#xa0;a lot, which covers <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html" rel="noreferrer">three main filter possibilities</a>:</p><ol><li><strong>Life is extraordinarily rare, almost impossible</strong></li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Great Filter Comes For Us All" class="kg-image" height="538" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-245.png" width="1024" /></figure><ol start="2"><li><strong>We are not a rare form of life, but near the first to evolve</strong></li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Great Filter Comes For Us All" class="kg-image" height="438" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-246.png" width="1024" /></figure><ol start="3"><li><strong>Almost no life makes it to this point</strong></li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Great Filter Comes For Us All" class="kg-image" height="528" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-247.png" width="1024" /></figure><p>Those are three Great Filter possibilities, but the question remains: why are we so alone in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe" rel="noreferrer">observable universe</a>? I grant you that&#xa0;what we&#xa0;<em>can</em>&#xa0;observe is appallingly tiny&#xa0;given the unimaginable scale of the universe, so &#x201c;what we can observe&#x201d; may not be enough by many orders of magnitude.</p><p>I encourage you to read the entire article, it&#x2019;s full of great ideas explained well, including many other Great Filter possibilities. Mostly I wanted to share <strong>my personal theory of why we haven&#x2019;t encountered alien life by now</strong>. Like computers themselves, things don&#x2019;t get larger. They get <em>smaller</em>. And <em>faster</em>. And so does intelligent life. </p><blockquote>Why build planet-size anything when the real action is in the small things? Small spaces, small units of time, <strong>everything gets smaller</strong>.</blockquote><p>Large is inefficient and unnecessary. Look at the history of computers: from giant to tiny and tinier. From slow to fast and faster. Personally, I have a feeling really advanced life eventually does away with all physical stuff that slows you down as soon as they can, and enters <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-infinite-space-between-words/" rel="noreferrer">the infinite spaces between</a>:</p><blockquote>This is, of course, a variant on the Fermi paradox: We don&#x2019;t see clues to widespread, large-scale engineering, and consequently we must conclude that we&#x2019;re alone. But the possibly flawed assumption here is when we say that highly visible construction projects are an inevitable outcome of intelligence.&#xa0;<strong>It could be that it&#x2019;s the engineering of the small, rather than the large, that is inevitable.</strong>&#xa0;This follows from the laws of inertia (smaller machines are faster, and require less energy to function) as well as the speed of light (small computers have faster internal communication). It may be &#x2013; and this is, of course, speculation &#x2013; that advanced societies are building small technology and have little incentive or need to rearrange the stars in their neighborhoods, for instance. They may prefer to build nanobots instead.<br /><br />&#x2013; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040604012520/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/tech/nextnews/archive/next031104.htm" rel="noreferrer">Seth Shostak</a></blockquote><p>Seth delivers an excellent TED talk on this topic as well: </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>If we can barely see far in the universe as is, there&#x2019;s no way we could possibly see into the infinite space and time between.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>That is of course just my opinion, but <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/her" rel="noreferrer">we&#x2019;ll see</a>... eventually.</p>'}]}

Yet there is something fundamental in our nature that desperately wants to get everyone together in one big room, to &#x201c;solve it.&#x201d; Our smarter, richer betters (in Babel times, the king&#x2019;s name was Nimrod) often preach the idea of a town square, a marketplace of ideas, a centralized hub of discourse and entertainment &#x2013; and we listen. But when I go back and read Genesis, I hear God saying: &#x201c;My children, I designed your brains to scale to 150 stable relationships. Anything beyond that is overclocking. You should all try Mastodon.&#x201d;</blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s been clear for quite some time that the early social media strategery of &#x201c;jam a million people in a colosseum and let them fight it out with free speech&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t panning out, but never has it been more clear than now, under the Elon Musk regime, that being beholden to the whims of a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-isnt-funny-bad-jokes-twitter-1234712950/" rel="noreferrer">billionaire going through a midlife crisis</a> isn&#x2019;t exactly healthy for society. Or you. Or me. Or anyone, really.</p><p>I tried to be fair; I gave the post-Elon Twitter era a week, thinking &#x201c;how bad could it possibly be?&#x201d; and good lord, <em>it was so much worse than I could have possibly ever imagined</em>. It&#x2019;s like Elon read the Dilbert pointy-haired-manager book on management and bonked his head on every rung of the ladder going down, generating an ever-growing laundry <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-terrible-things-hes-said-and-done" rel="noreferrer">list of terrible things</a> no manager should ever do. And he <em>kept going!</em></p><p>It&#x2019;s undeniably sad. <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/twitter-service-vs-platform/" rel="noreferrer">I really liked Twitter</a>, warts and all, from 2007 onward. In fact, it was the only &#x201c;social network&#x201d; I liked at all. Even when it became clear in the Trump era that Twitter was unhealthy for human minds, I soldiered on, gleaning what I could. I&#x2019;m not alone in that; Clay Shirky&#x2019;s moribund signoff at the end of 2022 reflected how I felt:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="I Fight For The Users" class="kg-image" height="1478" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/08/image-252.png" width="1333" /></figure><p>Indeed, Twitter was murdered at the whims of a billionaire high on Ketamine while it was (mostly) healthy, because of <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/elon-musk-x-twitter-purchase-daughter-jenna-musk-woke-virus" rel="noreferrer">the &#x201c;trans woke virus&#x201d;</a>.  </p><p>I urge you, all of you, <strong>to disavow Twitter and never look at it again</strong>. No one who cares about their mental health should be on Twitter at this point, or linking to Twitter and feeding it the attention it thrives on.

He demonstrated <strong>the very real dangers of any platform run by a king, a dictator, a tyrant, a despot, an autocrat</strong>.

We can and should have sane centralized services, of course, but <strong>it&#x2019;s imperative that we <em>also</em> build decentralized services which empower users and give them control</strong>, rather than treating them <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/are-you-a-digital-sharecropper/" rel="noreferrer">like digital sharecroppers</a>. That&#x2019;s what our <a href="https://discourse.org/" rel="noreferrer">Discourse project</a> is all about. I propose collective ownership of the content and the communities we build online. Yeah, it&#x2019;s more work, it&#x2019;s not &#x201c;free&#x201d; (sorry not sorry), but I have some uncomfortable news for you: those so-called &#x201c;free&#x201d; services <em>aren&#x2019;t really free</em>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="I Fight For The Users" class="kg-image" height="454" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-249.png" width="521" /></figure><p>Which, again, is not to say that &#x201c;free&#x201d; services don&#x2019;t have a place in the world, they do, but please don&#x2019;t harbor any illusions about what you are sacrificing in the name of &#x201c;free.&#x201d; Grow up.</p><p>I take a rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron" rel="noreferrer">Tron-like</a> view of the world when it comes to this stuff; in the software industry, our goal should be to <em>empower</em> users (with strong moderation tools), not exploit them. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="I Fight For The Users" class="kg-image" height="640" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-250.png" width="504" /></figure><p>So I encourage you to explore alternatives to Twitter, ideally open source, federated alternatives.

If you knew the right commands, you could type them in to load programs from cassette tape. But that was an expensive add-on option with early personal computers. For many of us, if we wanted the computer to do anything, we had to type in entire programs from books like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games">101 Basic Computer Games</a>, by hand... <a href="https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=2">like so</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Updating The Single Most Influential Book of the BASIC Era" class="kg-image" height="1049" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-257.png" width="784" /></figure><p>Yep, believe it or not, circa 1983, <em>this was our idea of a good time</em>. No, we didn&apos;t get out much. The book itself was a sort of greatest hits compilation of games collected from Ahl&#x2019;s seminal <a href="https://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n11/66_Dave_tells_Ahl__the_hist.php">Creative Computing Magazine</a> in the 1970s:</p><blockquote>As soon as Ahl made up his mind to leave DEC, he started laying the groundwork for Creative Computing. He announced intentions to publish the magazine at NCC in June 1974 and over the next few months contacted prospective authors, got mailing lists, arranged for typesetting and printing, and started organizing hundreds of other details.<br /><br />In addition, he also moved his family to Morristown, NJ, and settled into his new job at AT&amp;T. He had little spare capital, so he substituted for it with &#x201c;sweat equity.&#x201d; He edited submitted articles and wrote others. He specified type, took photos, got books of &#x201c;clip art,&#x201d; drew illustrations, and laid out boards. He wrote and laid out circulation flyers, pasted on labels, sorted and bundled mailings.<br /><br />By October 1974, when it was time to specify the first print run, he had just 600 subscribers. But Ahl had no intention of running off just 600 issues. He took all the money he had received, divided it in half, and printed 8000 copies with it. These rolled off the presses October 31, 1974. Ahl recounts the feeling of euphoria on the drive to the printer replaced by dismay when he saw two skids of magazines and wondered how he would ever get them off the premises. Three trips later, his basement and garage were filled with 320 bundles of 25 magazines each. He delivered the 600 subscriber copies to the post office the next day, but it took nearly three weeks to paste labels by hand onto the other 7400 copies and send them, unsolicited, to libraries and school systems throughout the country.</blockquote><p>I also <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-of-creative-computing/">loved Creative Computing</a>, but it was a little before my time:</p><ul><li>1971 &#x2013; Ahl ports the programs from FOCAL to BASIC.</li><li>1973 &#x2013; 101 BASIC Computer Games is first published by DEC.</li><li>1974 &#x2013; Ahl founds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Computing_(magazine)">Creative Computing</a> magazine and acquires the rights to the book from DEC.</li><li>1977 &#x2013; the &#x201c;trinity&#x201d; of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a> &#x1f5a5;&#xfe0f;, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">PET </a> &#xfe0f;&#x1f5a5;&#xfe0f;, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">TRS-80 </a> &#x1f5a5;&#xfe0f; microcomputers are released to the public, all with BASIC built in, at prices regular people could mostly afford. &#x1f64c;</li><li>1978 &#x2013; a second edition of BASIC Computer Games is released, this time published by Ahl himself.</li></ul><p>As you can see, there&#x2019;s no way average people in 1973-1976 were doing a whole lot with BASIC programs, as <em>they had no microcomputers capable of running BASIC to buy! </em>It took a while for inexpensive personal computers to trickle down to the mainstream, which brings us to roughly 1984 when the sequels started appearing.</p><p>There was a half-hearted attempt to <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/16765.basic-computer-games-small-basic-edition.aspx">modernize these early BASIC programs</a> in 2010 with SmallBasic, but I didn&#x2019;t feel these ports did much to bring the code up to date, and overall had little relevance to modern code practices.

The book quickly went into a second printing, for a total of 10,000 copies sold. &#x201c;That was far more books than there were computers around, so people were buying three, four, five of them for each computer.&#x201d;</blockquote><p>It went on to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games#Reception">first computer book to sell a million copies</a>. Quite a legacy.</p><p>I think we owe it to the world to bring this book up to date using <strong>modern, memory safe languages that embody the original spirit of BASIC, </strong>and modern programming practices including subroutines.</p><p>So let&#x2019;s do this. <strong>Please </strong><a href="https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games"><strong>join us on GitHub</strong></a>, where we&#x2019;re updating those original 101 BASIC games in 10 memory safe, general purpose scripting languages:</p><ul><li>Java / Kotlin</li><li>Python</li><li>C#</li><li>VB.NET</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>Ruby</li><li>Perl</li><li>Lua</li></ul><p>(Edit: as of March 2022, we&#x2019;ve a) offered Kotlin as an alternative to Java, b) removed Pascal since we can&#x2019;t guarantee memory safety there, and replaced it with Rust, which very much can, and c) added Lua which <em>just</em> cracked the top 20 in TIOBE and strongly meets the scripting and memory safe criteria.)</p><p>Now, bear in mind these are <em>very</em> primitive games from the 1970s. They aren&#x2019;t going to win any awards for gameplay, or programming sophistication. But they <em>are </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_mainframe_games">precious artifacts of early computing</a> that deserve to be preserved for future generations, including the wonderful <a href="http://www.bekerbots.com/botbooks.htm">original art by George Beker</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Updating The Single Most Influential Book of the BASIC Era" class="kg-image" height="318" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/Chomperanimated2.gif" width="300" /></figure><p><strong>We need your help to do this right</strong>, and <em>collaboratively together</em>, as with all modern programming projects.

About 50% more volume for considerably more than 2&#xd7; the power isn&#x2019;t a bad deal!)</p><p>I chose the Streacom DA2 as my personal build, because after experimenting heavily with the DAN A4 SFX, I realized you need more room to deal with extremely powerful CPUs and GPUs in this form factor, and I wanted a truly powerful system:</p><ul><li>Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/core/i9-processors/i9-9900ks.html">i9-9900KS</a> (8 core, 16 thread, 5.0 GHz) CPU </li><li>Samsung 970 PRO 1TB / Samsung 970 EVO 2TB / Samsung 860 QVO 4TB SATA</li><li>64GB DDR4-3000</li><li><a href="http://www.cryorig.com/h7.php">Cryorig H7</a> cooler (exact fit)</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU</li></ul><p>Compared to my old 2015-2017 system, a slightly overclocked i7-7700k, that at least gives me 2&#xd7; the cores (and faster cores, both in clock rate and IPC), 2&#xd7; the memory, and 2&#xd7; the M.2 slots (two versus one).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Building a PC, Part IX: Downsizing" class="kg-image" height="1576" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-161.png" width="2000" /></figure><p>The DA2 is a clever case though less perfect than the A4-SFX. What&#x2019;s neat about it is the hybrid open-air design (on the top and bottom) plus the versatile horizontal and vertical bracket system interior. Per the manual (PDF):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Building a PC, Part IX: Downsizing" class="kg-image" height="1262" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-162.png" width="2000" /></figure><p>Check out all the bracket mounting options.

You&#x2019;ll note that the front of the DA2 is totally solid, no air holes, so you do need that extra airflow.</p><p>I only have a few criticisms of this Streacom DA2 case:</p><ul><li>The side panels are tool free, which is excellent, but the pressure fit makes them fairly difficult to remove. Feels like this could be tweaked?</li><li>(Don&#x2019;t even think about using a full sized ATX power supply. In theory it is supported, but the build becomes so much more difficult. Use a SFX power supply, which you&#x2019;d expect to do for a mini-ITX build anyway.)</li><li>My primary complaint is that the <strong>power extension cable gets in the way</strong>. I had to remove it and re-attach it during my build. They should custom route the power cable upwards so it blocks less stuff.</li><li>Less of a criticism and more of an observation: if your build uses a powerful GPU and CPU, you&#x2019;ll need two case fans. There&#x2019;s mounting points for a 92mm fan in the rear, and the bracket system makes it easy to mount a 140mm fan blowing inward. You will definitely need both fans!</li></ul><p>Here&#x2019;s the configuration I recommend, open on both the top and bottom for maximum airflow, with three fans total:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Building a PC, Part IX: Downsizing" class="kg-image" height="1676" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-165.png" width="2000" /></figure><p>If you are a water cooling kind of person &#x2013; I am definitely not, I experienced one too many traumatic cooling fluid leaks in the early 2000s &#x2013; then you will use that 140mm space for the radiator.</p><p>I have definitely <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/is-your-computer-stable/">burn-in tested</a> this machine, as I do all systems I build, and it passed with flying colors. But to be honest, if you expect to be under full CPU and GPU loads for extended periods of time you <em>might</em> need to switch to water cooling due to the space constraints. (Or pick slightly less powerful components.)</p><p>If you haven&#x2019;t built a PC system recently, it&#x2019;s easier than it has ever been. Heck by the time you install the M.2 drives, memory, CPU, and cooler on the motherboard you&#x2019;re almost done, these days!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Building a PC, Part IX: Downsizing" class="kg-image" height="2667" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-166.png" width="2000" /></figure><p>There are a lot of interesting <a href="https://yuel-beast-designs.myshopify.com/products/motif-monument">compact mini-itx builds</a> out there.

They aren&#x2019;t much more than a battery and an electric motor to begin with. Remember the&#xa0;<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Sebastopol-s-Zap-Power-Systems-is-banking-on-3067718.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappy electric scooter</a>&#xa0;from twenty years ago?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="1435" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-272.png" width="1240" /></figure><p>What killed the electric scooter back then is the same thing that&#xa0;killed the electric car&#xa0;of year 2000: terrible lead-acid battery technology. It&#x2019;s too heavy, it lacks power, it doesn&#x2019;t have enough range, it takes too long to charge. These are all different ways of saying the same thing:&#xa0;<em>the battery sucks</em>. It wasn&#x2019;t until Lithium Ion batteries matured that both the electric car and the electric scooter &#x2013; and pretty much electric&#xa0;<em>everything</em>, if you think about it &#x2013; became viable.</p><p>Thus, one way to see if Lithium Ion battery prices are indeed generally dropping independent of all other manufacturing concerns is to examine the cost of electric scooters over the last few years. Let&#x2019;s consider one of the most popular models, the Xiaomi Mi M365:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="459" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-273.png" width="766" /></figure><p>This graph only shows roughly two years, from January 2018 to now; it looks like the original price for the Xiaomi M365 when it hit the US market in early 2017 was around $800. So&#xa0;<strong>the price of a popular, common electric scooter has&#xa0;<em>halved</em>&#xa0;in three years.</strong>&#xa0;Very good news indeed for electric vehicles of all types!</p><p>This dramatic drop in electric scooter price from 2016 to 2019 may not be surprising versus the parallel rise of the quasi-legal electric scooter smartphone app rental industry over roughly the same time period, in the form of Bird, Lime, Skip, Spin, Scoot, etc.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="800" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-274.png" width="1200" /></figure><p>Early versions of Bird scooters were&#xa0;<em>actual Xiaomi M365s</em>, slightly modified for rental. Only by late 2018 had they&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_(company)#Vehicles" rel="noreferrer">migrated to</a>&#xa0;custom built, ruggedized scooters optimized for the rental market. The rental industries&#xa0;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bird-scooters-money-profit-strategy-20190505-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">have their own challenges</a>, and ironically have started to pivot to monthly rentals rather than the classic 15 cents per minute.</p><blockquote>Bird has experimented with its business model in recent months. In early March, the company altered its repair program in Los Angeles, which had relied on gig workers to fix broken scooters. It moved repairs in-house (though scooters are still charged each night by an army of gig workers). Later that month, the company introduced scooters with locks in some markets, in a bid to prevent theft and vandalism.<br /><br />In April, it announced the launch of a more traditional rental program in San Francisco and Barcelona, in which users could pay $25 per month to rent a Xiaomi m365 from the company rather than paying per ride.</blockquote><p>But this isn&#x2019;t meant to be a blog entry about the viability of scooter rental company business models.</p><p>I want to tackle a more fundamental question:&#xa0;<strong>are electric scooters the future of transportation?</strong></p><p>Even Uber, as screwed up of a company as they still are, knows cars are overkill for a lot of basic transportation needs:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="844" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/09/image-6.png" width="806" /></figure><p>We have plenty of scooters here at my house, and the family and I enjoy them greatly, but I have never actually ridden or owned an electric scooter.

I put Slime in my Mi&#x2019;s tires out of an abundance of caution, but you could also go with solid tubeless tires &#x2013; at the cost of some ride comfort &#x2013; if you&#x2019;re really worried.)</p><p>That&#x2019;s not to say that the electric scooter experience is perfect. There are some challenges with electric scooters, starting with the biggest one:&#xa0;your local government has <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/are-electric-scooters-legal-know-the-law-where-you-live" rel="noreferrer">no idea how to regulate the darn things</a>.</p><ul><li>Is this regulated like a bicycle? If not, why not?</li><li>Are they allowed on the sidewalk?</li><li>Do you have to ride them in the road, with cars&#x2026; uh, depending on the speed limit?</li><li>Do you need a driver&#x2019;s license?</li><li>Do you need a helmet?</li><li>Are you even&#xa0;<em>allowed</em>&#xa0;to legally ride them in public at all outside of private property?</li></ul><p>The answers also vary wildly depending on where you live, and with no consistency or apparent logic. Here are&#xa0;the current <a href="https://bayareabicyclelaw.com/new-e-scooter-laws-2019/" rel="noopener noreferrer">electric scooter laws in California</a>, for what it&#x2019;s worth, which&#xa0;<em>require the rider to have a valid driver&#x2019;s license</em>&#xa0;(unlike electric bicycles) and also disallow them from sidewalks, both of which I feel are onerous and unnecessary restrictions.</p><p>One aspect of those laws I&#xa0;<em>definitely</em>&#xa0;agree with, however, is the&#xa0;<strong>15 mile per hour speed restriction</strong>. That&#x2019;s a plenty brisk top speed for a standing adult with no special safety equipment. Anything faster starts to get decidedly&#x2026; uncomfortable. Consider this monster of a&#xa0;<a href="https://www.ewheels.com/product/new-turbowheel-lightning-957wh-battery-2x-1000w-3600w-motors/" rel="noopener noreferrer">1165KWh electric scooter</a>, with dual motors and dual suspension that goes up to&#xa0;<em>forty freakin&#x2019; miles per hour</em>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>That&#x2026; is&#x2026; terrifying. Even the reviewer, in full motorcycle safety gear, wasn&#x2019;t willing to push it all the way to 40 MPH. And I don&#x2019;t blame him! But now that I&#x2019;ve shown you the undisputed Honda Civic everyman budget model of electric scooter in the M365, hopefully this gives you a taste of the wider emerging diversity in these kinds of minimalistic electric vehicles.

Did I mention there&#x2019;s a Bluetooth connection, and an app, and it is possible to&#xa0;hack the M365 firmware? Pretty cool how electric vehicles are inherently digital, isn&#x2019;t it?</p><p>Here are a few other observations after riding my M365 around a fair bit:</p><ul><li><strong>Please be respectful around pedestrians.</strong>&#xa0;Most of the sidewalks around here are not busy at all, but the pedestrians I encountered on the electric scooter were definitely more freaked out than I&#x2019;ve seen before when using regular kick scooters (or skateboards) on the sidewalk, which did surprise me. An electric scooter has more heft to it, both physically at 26 pounds, and in the 15 mile per hour speed it can reach &#x2013; but also mentally in terms of how it looks and how people approach it. I recommend slowing down to just above walking speed when encountering pedestrians, and if there is a bike lane available, I&#x2019;d definitely recommend using that.</li><li><strong>Hills work great.</strong>&#xa0;The kryptonite of traditional kick scooters is hills, and I&#x2019;m pleased to report that even with a&#xa0;cough&#xa0;sizable adult such as myself riding, I was able to sustain a respectable above-walking speed on most <em>reasonable</em> hills. Where I looked at a hill and thought &#x201c;this probably should work,&#x201d; it did. That&#x2019;s impressive, considering this&#xa0;<em>isn&#x2019;t</em>&#xa0;the upgraded Pro model with bigger battery and more powerful motor. On flats and downhills the performance is superb, as you&#x2019;d expect. That said, if you are a really big or tall adult, or live in a particularly hilly area, wait for the Pro model or an equivalent.</li><li><strong>Portability is good, but borderline.</strong>&#xa0;At ~26 pounds, the electric scooter is reasonably portable, but it&#x2019;s not something you a) could really get away with taking inside a restaurant / store with you to prevent theft or b) want to be carrying around on your person for any significant length of time. It&#x2019;s not nearly as nimble or portable as a kick scooter, but that&#x2019;s a high bar. You&#x2019;ll need to carry a bike lock and think about how to lock your scooter on bike racks, which turned out to be&#x2026; more geometrically challenging than I anticipated due to the small tires, disc brakes, and the engine in the front wheel. They need more obvious locking points on the chassis.</li></ul><p>To be honest with you I&#x2019;m still bitter about the whole&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_Inc." rel="noopener noreferrer">Segway</a>&#xa0;debacle. There was so much hype back in the day. That ridiculous thing was&#xa0;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1203segway-unveiled/" rel="noopener noreferrer">supposed to change the world</a>. Instead, we got&#x2026;&#xa0;<em>Paul Blart Mall Cop</em>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="600" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-279.png" width="400" /></figure><p>A Segway was $5,000 at launch in 2001, which is a whopping $7,248 in inflation adjusted dollars. Here in 2019, cheap $200 to $300 electric scooters are basically the transformational technology the Segway was&#xa0;<em>supposed</em>&#xa0;to be, aren&#x2019;t they? Are electric scooters the future of (most) transportation? I&#x2019;m not sure, but I do like where we&#x2019;re headed, even if it took us twenty years to get there.</p>'}]}

I rest my case.</p><p>After 7 years, the station wagon had to go. We initially looked at hybrids because, well,&#xa0;isn&#x2019;t that <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Oh-so-pious-Prius-drivers-Smugness-drifts-2581016.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">required in California at this point</a>?&#xa0;But if you know me at all, you know I&#x2019;m a boil the sea kinda guy at heart. I figure if you&#x2019;re going to flirt with partially electric cars, why not put aside these half measures and go all the way?</p><p>Do you remember that rapturous&#xa0;<a href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 Oatmeal comic</a> about the Tesla model S? Even for a person who has basically zero interest in automobiles, it did sound&#xa0;<em>really cool</em>.</p><p><a href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p><p>It&#x2019;s been 5 years, but from time to time I&#x2019;d see some electric vehicle on the road and I&#x2019;d think about that&#xa0;<strong>Intergalactic SpaceBoat of Light and Wonder</strong>. Maybe it&#x2019;s time for our family to jump on the electric car trend, too, and just late enough that we can avoid the bleeding edge and end up merely on the&#x2026;&#xa0;<em>leading</em>&#xa0;edge?</p><p>That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re now the proud owners of a fully&#xa0;<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a26144426/2019-kia-niro-ev-driven/" rel="noopener noreferrer">electric 2019 Kia Niro</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a26144426/2019-kia-niro-ev-driven/" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p><p>I&#x2019;ve somehow gone from being a person who basically doesn&#x2019;t care about cars at all&#x2026; to being&#xa0;<strong>one of those insufferable electric car people who won&#x2019;t shut up about them</strong>. I apologize in advance. If you suddenly feel an overwhelming urge to close this browser tab, I don&#x2019;t blame you.</p><p>I was expecting another car, like the three we bought before. What I got, instead, was a transformation:</p><ul><li>Yes, yes, electric cars are clean, but it&#x2019;s a revelation how clean&#xa0;<em>everything</em>&#xa0;is in an electric. You take for granted how dirty and noisy gas based cars are in daily operation &#x2013; the engine noise, the exhaust fumes, the brake dust on the rims, the oily residues and thin black film that descends on everything, the way you have to wash your hands every time you use the gas station pumps. You don&#x2019;t fully appreciate how oppressive those little dirty details were until they&#x2019;re gone.</li><li>Electric cars are (almost) completely silent. I guess technically in 2019 electric cars require artificial soundmakers at low speed for safety, and this car has one. But The Oatmeal was right. Electric cars&#xa0;<em>feel</em>&#xa0;like spacecraft because they move so effortlessly. There&#x2019;s virtually no delay from action to reaction, near immediate acceleration and deceleration&#x2026; with almost no sound or vibration at all, like you&#x2019;re in freakin&#x2019; space! It&#x2019;s so immensely satisfying!</li><li>Electric cars aren&#x2019;t just&#xa0;<em>electric</em>, they&#x2019;re utterly digital to their very core. Gas cars always felt like the classic 1950s Pixar Cars world of grease monkeys and machine shop guys, maybe with a few digital bobbins added here and there as an afterthought. This electric car, on the other hand, is squarely in the post-iPhone world of everyday digital gadgets. It feels more like a giant smartphone than a car. I am a programmer, I&#x2019;m a digital guy, I love digital stuff. And electric cars are part of&#xa0;<em>my</em>&#xa0;world, rather than the other way around. It feels good.</li><li>Electric cars are mechanically much simpler than gasoline cars, which means they are inherently more reliable and cheaper to maintain. An internal combustion engine has hundreds of moving parts, many of which require regular maintenance, fluids, filters, and tune ups. It also has a complex transmission to translate the narrow power band of a gas powered engine. None of this is necessary on an electric vehicle, whose electric motor is basically one moving part with simple 100% direct drive from the motor to the wheels. This newfound simplicity is deeply appealing to a guy who always saw cars as incredibly complicated (but computers, not so much).</li><li>Being able to charge at home overnight is perhaps the most radical transformation of all. Your house is now a &#x201c;gas station.&#x201d; Our Kia Niro has a range of about&#xa0;<strong>250 miles</strong>&#xa0;on a full battery. With any modern electric car, provided you drive less than 200 miles a day round trip (who even drives this much?), it&#x2019;s very unlikely you&#x2019;ll ever need to &#x201c;fill the tank&#x201d; anywhere but at home. Ever. It&#x2019;s so strange to think that in 50 years, <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/As-EVs-threaten-gas-stations-owners-turn-to-14291843.php" rel="noreferrer">gas stations&#xa0;may eventually be as odd</a> to see in public as public telephone booths now are. Our charger is, conveniently enough, right next to the driveway since that&#x2019;s where the power breaker box was. With the level 2 charger installed, it literally&#xa0;<em>looks</em>&#xa0;like a gas pump on the side of the house, except this one &#x201c;pumps&#x201d;&#x2026; electrons.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Electric Geek Transportation Systems" class="kg-image" height="2667" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/level-2-ev-charger.jpg" width="2000" /></figure><p>This electric car is such a great experience. It&#x2019;s so much better than our gas powered station wagon that I swear, if there was a fully electric minivan (there isn&#x2019;t) I would literally sell our Honda minivan&#xa0;<em>tomorrow</em>&#xa0;and switch over. Without question. And believe me, I had no plans to sell that vehicle two months ago. The electric car is&#xa0;<em>that much better</em>.</p><p>I was expecting &#x201c;yet another car,&#x201d; but what I got instead was a new, radical worldview. Driving a car powered by barely controlled liquid fuel detonations used to be normal. But in an world of more and more viable electric vehicles this status quo increasingly starts to feel&#x2026; deeply unnatural. Electric is so much better of an overall experience that you begin to wonder: why did we&#xa0;<em>ever</em>&#xa0;do it that way?</p><p>Gas cars seem, for lack of a better word,&#xa0;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/" rel="noreferrer"><em>obsolete</em></a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/"><img alt="Electric Geek Transportation Systems" class="kg-image" height="533" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/ev-sales.jpg" width="740" /></a></figure><p>How did this transformation happen, from my perspective, so suddenly? When exactly did electric cars go from &#x201c;expensive, experimental thing for crazy people&#x201d; to &#x201c;By God, I&#x2019;ll never buy another old fashioned gasoline based car if I can help it&#x201d;?</p><p>I was vaguely aware of the early electric cars. I even remember one coworker circa 2001 who owned a bright neon green Honda Insight. I ignored it all because, like I said,&#xa0;<em>I&#x2019;m not a car guy</em>. I needed to do the research to understand the history, and I started with the often recommended documentary,&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F" rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Killed the Electric Car?</a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>This is mostly about the original highly experimental&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Motors EV1</a>&#xa0;from 1996 to 1999. It&#x2019;s so early the first models had lead-acid batteries! &#x1f631; There&#x2019;s a number of conspiracy theories floated in the video, but I think the simple answer to the implied question in the title is straight up&#xa0;<em>price</em>. The battery tech was nowhere near ready, and per the Wikipedia article the estimated actual cost of the car was somewhere between $100,000 and $250,000 though I suspect it was much closer to the latter. It is interesting to note how much the owners (well, leasers) loved their EV1s. Having gone through that same conversion myself, I empathize!</p><p>I then watched the sequel,&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Electric_Car" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revenge of the Electric Car</a>. This one is essential, because it covers the dawn of the modern electric car we have today.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>This chronicles the creation of three very influential early electric cars &#x2013; the&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nissan Leaf</a>, the&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chevy Volt</a>, and of course the&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(2008)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesla Roadster</a>&#xa0;from 2005 - 2008. The precise moment that Lithium-Ion batteries were in play &#x2013; that&#x2019;s when electric cars started to become viable. Every one of these three electric cars was well conceived and made it to market in volume, though not without significant challenges, both internal and external. None of them were perfect electric vehicles by any means: the Roadster was $100k, the Leaf had limited range, and the Volt was still technically a hybrid, albeit only using the gasoline engine to charge the battery.</p><p>Ten years later, Tesla has the model 3 at $38,000 and we bought our Kia Niro for about the same price. After national and state tax incentives and rebates, that puts the price at around $30,000. It&#x2019;s not as cheap as it needs to be&#x2026; yet. But it&#x2019;s getting there. And it&#x2019;s&#xa0;already <a href="https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/clean-technology/faceoff-electric-vs-gas-cars-on-cost-15555966/" rel="noopener noreferrer">competitive with gasoline vehicles</a> in 2019.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Electric Geek Transportation Systems" class="kg-image" height="1126" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/2019-civic-vs-leaf-1.jpg" width="1067" /></figure><p>It&#x2019;s still early, but the trend lines are clear. And I&#x2019;m here to tell you that right now, today, I&#x2019;d buy&#xa0;<em>any</em>&#xa0;modern electric car over a gasoline powered car.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>If you too are intrigued by the idea of owning an electric car,&#xa0;<em>you should be</em>. It&#x2019;s freaking awesome! Bring your skepticism, as always; I highly recommend the above Matt Ferrell explainer video on electric vehicle myths.</p><p>As for me, I have seen the future, and it is absolutely, inexorably, and unavoidably&#x2026; electric.&#x26a1;</p>'}]}

Here&#x2019;s what the author of uBlock Origin, an ad blocking plugin for Chrome,&#xa0;<a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/338#issuecomment-496009417" rel="noopener noreferrer">has to say</a>&#xa0;about today&#x2019;s announcement:</p><blockquote>In order for Google Chrome to reach its current user base, it had to support content blockers &#x2013; these are the top most popular extensions for any browser. Google strategy has been to find the optimal point between the two goals of growing the user base of Google Chrome and preventing content blockers from harming its business.<br /><br />The blocking ability of the webRequest API caused Google to yield control of content blocking to content blockers. Now that Google Chrome is the dominant browser, it is in a better position to shift the optimal point between the two goals which benefits Google&#x2019;s primary business.<br /><br />The deprecation of the blocking ability of the webRequest API is to gain back this control, and to further instrument and report how web pages are filtered, since the exact filters which are applied to web pages are useful information which will be collectable by Google Chrome.</blockquote><p>The ad blockers themselves are arguably just as complicit.

Given the plateauing of CPU speeds, I think five years of useful life for these boxes is realistic, but let&#x2019;s assume a conservative three year lifespan to be safe.</p><ul><li>$880 mini-pc 32GB RAM, 6 CPUs, 500GB SSD</li><li>$120 taxes / shipping / misc</li><li>$29 &#xd7; 12 &#xd7; 3 = $1,044</li></ul><p>That&#x2019;s&#xa0;<strong>$2,044 for three years of hosting</strong>.

Per&#xa0;<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">their current pricing page</a>:</p><ul><li>32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs, 640GB SSD</li><li>$160/month</li><li>$160 &#xd7; 12 &#xd7; 3 =&#xa0;<strong>$5,760</strong></li></ul><p>This isn&#x2019;t&#xa0;<em>quite</em>&#xa0;apples to apples, as we are getting an extra 140GB of disk and 2 bonus CPUs, but those CPUs are both slower and partially consumed by multi-tenancy compared to our brand new dedicated, isolated CPUs. (I was curious about this, so I just spun up a new $160/month DO instance for a quick test. The&#xa0;<code>sysbench</code>&#xa0;results are 4086 and 11760 respectively, considerably below the 2019 Mini-PC results, above.) As you can see,&#xa0;<strong>you pay almost three times as much for a cloud server.</strong>&#xa0;&#x1f911;</p><p>I&#x2019;m not saying this is for everyone. If you just need to spin up a quick server or two for testing and experimentation, there&#x2019;s absolutely no way you need to go to the trouble and up-front cost of building and then racking colocated mini-pcs. There&#x2019;s no denying that spinning servers up in the cloud offers unparalleled flexibility and redundancy.

How useful is Stack Overflow, from the perspective of what I consider to be one of the greatest living programmers?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="353" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/09/image-3.png" width="1102" /></figure><p>I won&#x2019;t lie, September 17th, 2013 was a&#xa0;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_05qJTeNNI" rel="noopener noreferrer">pretty good day</a>. I literally got chills when I read that, and not just because I always read the word &#x201c;billions&#x201d; in Carl Sagan&#x2019;s voice. It was also pleasantly the opposite of pretty much every&#xa0;<em>other</em>&#xa0;day I&#x2019;m on Twitter, scrolling through an oppressive, endless litany of shared human suffering and people screaming at each other. Which reminds me, I should&#xa0;check my Twitter&#xa0;and see who else is wrong on the Internet today.</p><p>I am honored and humbled by the public utility that Stack Overflow has unlocked for a whole generation of programmers.

I find failure much more instructive, and when building a business and planning for the future, I take on the role of Abyss Domain Expert&#x2122; and begin a staring contest. It&#x2019;s just a little something I like to do, you know...&#xa0;<em>for me</em>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="962" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-27.png" width="960" /></figure><p>Thus, what I&#x2019;d like to do right now is peer into that glorious abyss for a bit and introspect about&#xa0;<strong>the challenges I see facing Stack Overflow for the next 10 years.</strong>&#xa0;Before I begin, I do want to be absolutely crystal clear about a few things:</p><ol><li>I <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/farewell-stack-exchange/" rel="noreferrer">have not worked at Stack Overflow</a> in any capacity whatsoever&#xa0;since February 2012&#xa0;and I&#x2019;ve had zero day-to-day operational input since that date, more or less by choice. Do I have opinions about how things should be done? Uh, have you&#xa0;<em>met me?</em>&#xa0;Do I email people every now and then about said opinions? I might, but I honestly do try to keep it to an absolute minimum, and I think my email archive track record here is reasonable.</li><li>The people working at Stack are amazing and most of them (including much of the Stack Overflow community, while I&#x2019;m at it) could articulate the mission better &#x2014; and perhaps a tad less crankily &#x2014; than I could by the time I left. Would I trust them with my life? No. But I&#x2019;d trust them with Joel&#x2019;s life!</li><li>The whole point of the Stack Overflow exercise is that it&#x2019;s not beholden to me, or Joel, or&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory" rel="noopener noreferrer">any other Great Person</a>. Stack Overflow works because it empowers regular everyday programmers all over the world, just like you, just like me. I guess in my mind it&#x2019;s akin to being a parent. The goal is for your children to eventually grow up to be sane, practicing adults who don&#x2019;t need (or, really,&#xa0;<em>want</em>) you to hang around any more.</li><li>Understand that you&#x2019;re reading&#xa0;<s>the weak opinions strongly held</s>&#xa0;the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">strong opinions weakly held</a>&#xa0;of a co-founder who spent prodigious amounts of time working with the community in the first four years of Stack Overflow&#x2019;s life to shape the rules and norms of the site to fit their needs. These are merely my opinions. I like to think they are&#xa0;<em>informed</em>&#xa0;opinions, but that doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean I can predict the future, or that I am even qualified to try. But I&#x2019;ve never let being &#x201c;qualified&#x201d; stop me from doing anything, and I ain&#x2019;t about to start tonight.</li></ol><h3 id="stack-overflow-is-a-wiki-first">Stack Overflow is a wiki first</h3><p>Stack Overflow ultimately has&#xa0;<em>much</em>&#xa0;more in common with Wikipedia than a discussion forum. By this I mean questions and answers on Stack Overflow are not primarily judged by their usefulness to a specific individual, but by&#xa0;<strong>how many <em>other</em>&#xa0;programmers that question or answer can potentially help over time</strong>. I tried as hard as I could to emphasize this relationship from&#xa0;launch day in 2008. Note who has top billing in this Venn diagram.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="431" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stack-overflow-venn-diagram.png" width="440" /></figure><p>Stack Overflow later added a super neat feature to highlight this core value in user profiles, where it shows how many other people you have potentially helped with your contributed questions and answers so far.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="368" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stackoverflow-people-reached-profile-stat-1.png" width="431" /></figure><p>The most common complaints I see about Stack Overflow are usually the result of this fundamental misunderstanding about who the questions and answers on the site are ultimately&#xa0;<em>for</em>, and why there&#x2019;s so much strictness involved in the whole process.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="398" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/09/image-4.png" width="1090" /></figure><p>I&#x2019;m continually amazed at the number of people, even on Hacker News today, who don&#x2019;t realize that every single question and answer is editable on Stack Overflow, even as a completely anonymous user who isn&#x2019;t logged in. Which makes sense, right,&#xa0;<em>because Stack Overflow is a wiki</em>, and that&#x2019;s how wikis work. Anyone can edit them. Go ahead, try it right now if you don&#x2019;t believe me &#x2013; press the &#x201c;improve this answer&#x201d; or &#x201c;improve this question&#x201d; button on anything that can be improved, and make it so.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="323" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stack-overflow-edit-question.png" width="861" /></figure><p>The responsibility for this misunderstanding is all on Stack Overflow (and by that I also mean myself, at least up until 2012). I guess the logic is that &#x201c;every programmer has surely seen, used, and understands Stack Overflow by now, 10 years in&#x201d; but... I think that&#x2019;s a risky assumption. New programmers are minted every second of every day. Complicating matters further, there are three tiers of usage at Stack Overflow, from biggest to smallest, in inverted pyramid style:</p><ol><li><strong>I passively search for programming answers. </strong>Passively searching and reading highly ranked Stack Overflow answers as they appear in web search results is arguably the&#xa0;<em>primary goal of Stack Overflow</em>. If Stack Overflow is working like it&#x2019;s supposed to, 98% of programmers should get all the answers they need from reading search result pages and wouldn&#x2019;t need to ask or answer a single question in their entire careers. This is a good thing! Great, even!</li><li><strong>I participate on Stack Overflow when I get stuck on a really hairy problem and searching isn&#x2019;t helping. </strong>Participating only at those times when you are extra stuck is completely valid. However, I feel this level is where most people tend to run into difficulty on Stack Overflow, because it involves someone who may not be new to Stack Overflow per se, but is new to asking questions, and also at the precise time of stress and tension for them where they&#xa0;<em>must</em>&#xa0;get an answer due to a problem they&#x2019;re facing&#x2026; and they don&#x2019;t have the time or inclination to deal with Stack Overflow&#x2019;s strict wiki type requirements for research effort, formatting, showing previous work, and referencing what they found in prior searches.</li><li><strong>I participate on Stack Overflow for professional development. </strong>At this level you&#x2019;re talking about experienced Stack Overflow users who have contributed many answers and thus have a pretty good idea of what makes a great question, the kind they&#x2019;d want to answer themselves. As a result, they don&#x2019;t tend to ask many questions because they self-medicate through exhaustive searching and research, but when they do ask one, their questions are exemplary.</li></ol><p>(There&#x2019;s technically a fourth tier here, for people who want to selflessly contribute creative commons questions and answers to move the entire field of software development forward for the next generation of software developers. But who has time for saints &#x1f607;, y&#x2019;all make the rest of us look bad, so knock it off already, Skeet.)</p><p>It wouldn&#x2019;t shock me at all if people spent&#xa0;<em>years</em>&#xa0;happily at tier 1 and then got a big unpleasant surprise when reaching tier 2. The primary place to deal with this, in my opinion, is a&#xa0;<strong>massively revamped and improved ask page</strong>. It&#x2019;s also fair to note that maybe people don&#x2019;t understand that they&#x2019;re signing up for a sizable chunk of work by implicitly committing to the wiki standard of &#x201c;try to make sure it&#x2019;s useful to more people than just yourself&#x201d; when asking a question on Stack Overflow, and are then put off by the negative reaction to what others view as an insufficiently researched question.</p><p>Stack Overflow absorbs so much tension from its adoption of wiki standards for content. Even if you know about that requirement up front, it is not always clear what &#x201c;useful&#x201d; means, in the same way it&#x2019;s not always clear what topics, people, and places are deserving of a Wikipedia page.&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrietta Lacks</a>, absolutely, but what about your cousin Dave in Omaha with his weirdo PHP 5.6 issue?</p><h3 id="over-time-duplicates-become-vast-landmine-fields">Over time, duplicates become vast landmine fields</h3><p>Here&#x2019;s one thing&#xa0;I really, really saw coming&#xa0;and to be honest with you I was kinda glad I left in 2012 before I had to deal with it because of the incredible technical difficulty involved:&#xa0;<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/04/29/handling-duplicate-questions/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>duplicates</strong></a>. Of all the complaints I hear about Stack Overflow, this is the one I am most sympathetic to by far.</p><p>If you accept that Stack Overflow is a wiki type system, then for the same reasons that you obviously can&#x2019;t have five different articles about Italy on Wikipedia,&#xa0;<strong>Stack Overflow can&#x2019;t allow duplicate questions on the exact same programming problem</strong>. While there is a fair amount of code to do pre-emptive searches as people type in questions, plus&#xa0;<em>many</em>&#xa0;exhortations to search before you ask, with an inviting search field and button right there on the mandatory page you see before asking your first question...</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="539" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-29.png" width="1313" /></figure><p>...locating and identifying duplicate content is an insanely difficult problem even for a company like Google that&#x2019;s done nothing but specialize in this exact problem for, what, 20 years now, with a veritable army of the world&#x2019;s most talented engineers.</p><p>When you&#x2019;re asking a question on a site that doesn&#x2019;t allow duplicate questions, the problem space of a site with 1 million existing questions is rather different from a site with 10 million existing questions... or 100 million. Asking a single unique question goes from mildly difficult to mission almost impossible, because your question needs to thread a narrow path through this vast, enormous field of prior art questions without stepping on any of the vaguely similar looking landmines in the process.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="532" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stackoverflow-asking-duplicate-question.png" width="941" /></figure><p>But wait!&#xa0;<em>It gets harder!</em></p><ul><li>Some <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/16/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/" rel="noopener noreferrer">variance in similar-ish questions</a> is OK, because 10 different people will ask a nearly identical question using 10 different sets of completely unrelated words with no overlap. I know, it sounds crazy, but trust me: humans are amazing at this. We want all those duplicates to exist so they can&#xa0;<em>point to</em>&#xa0;the primary question they are a duplicate of, while still being valid search targets for people who ask questions with unusual or rare word choices.</li><li>It can be legitimately difficult to determine if your question is a true duplicate. How much overlap is enough before one programming question is a duplicate of another? And by whose definition? Opinions vary. This is subject to human interpretation, and humans are.. unreliable. Nobody will ever be completely happy with this system, pretty much by design. That tension is baked in permanently and forever.</li></ul><p>I don&#x2019;t have any real answers on the duplicate problem, which only gets worse over time. But I will point out that there is plenty of precedent&#xa0;on <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites#traffic" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Stack Exchange network</a>&#xa0;for splitting sites into &#x201c;expert&#x201d; and &#x201c;beginner&#x201d; areas with slightly different rulesets. We&#x2019;ve seen this for Math vs. MathOverflow, English vs. English Learners, Unix vs. Ubuntu...&#xa0;<strong>perhaps it&#x2019;s time for a more beginner focused Stack Overflow</strong>&#xa0;where duplicates are less frowned upon, and conversational rules are a bit more lenient?</p><h3 id="stack-overflow-is-a-competitive-system-of-peer-review">Stack Overflow is a competitive system of peer review</h3><p>Stack Overflow was indeed built to be a fairly explicitly competitive system, with the caveat that&#xa0;&#x201c;there&#x2019;s <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt" rel="noopener noreferrer">always more than one way</a>&#xa0;to do it.&#x201d; This design choice was based on my perennial observation that the best way to motivate any programmer... is to subtly insinuate that&#xa0;<em>another</em>&#xa0;programmer could have maybe done it better.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="572" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-30.png" width="1462" /></figure><p>This is manifested in the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/for-a-bit-of-colored-ribbon/" rel="noreferrer">public reputation</a> system on Stack Overflow, the incredible power of a number printed next to someone&#x2019;s name, writ large. All reputation in Stack Overflow comes from the recognition of your peers, never the &#x201c;system.&#x201d;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="741" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stack-overflow-top-rep-by-year.png" width="1564" /></figure><p>Once your question is asked, or your answer is posted, it can then be poked, prodded, edited, flagged, closed, opened, upvoted, downvoted,&#xa0;<a href="http://www.cs.mun.ca/~harold/Courses/Old/CS1400.W15/Diary/Lubar1992.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">folded and spindled</a>&#xa0;by your peers. The&#xa0;<em>intent</em>&#xa0;is for Stack Overflow to be a system of peer review and friendly competition, like a code review from a coworker you&#x2019;ve never met at a different division of the company. It&#x2019;s also completely fair for a fellow programmer to question the premise of your question, as long as it&#x2019;s done in a nice way. For example,&#xa0;do you really want to use that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags" rel="noopener noreferrer">regular expression to match HTML</a>?</p><p>I fully acknowledge that&#xa0;<strong>competitive peer review systems aren&#x2019;t for everyone</strong>, and thus the overall process of having peers review your question may not always feel great, depending on your circumstances and background in the field &#x2013;&#xa0;<em>particularly</em>&#xa0;when combined with the substantial tensions around utility and duplicates Stack Overflow already absorbed from its wiki elements. Kind of a double whammy there.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve heard people describe the process of asking a question on Stack Overflow as anxiety inducing. To me, posting on Stack Overflow is&#xa0;<em>supposed</em>&#xa0;to involve a healthy kind of minor &#x201c;let me be sure to show off my best work&#x201d; anxiety:</p><ul><li>the anxiety of giving a presentation to your fellow peers</li><li>the anxiety of doing well on a test</li><li>the anxiety of showing up to a new job with talented coworkers you admire</li><li>the anxiety of attending your first day at school with other students at your level</li></ul><p>I imagine systems where there is zero anxiety involved and I can only think of jobs where I had long since stopped caring about the work and thus had no anxiety about whether I even showed for work on any given day. How can that be good? Let&#x2019;s just say I&#x2019;m not a fan of zero-anxiety systems.</p><p>Maybe competition just isn&#x2019;t your jam. Could there be a less competitive Q&amp;A system, a system without downvotes, a system without close votes, where there was never any anxiety about posting anything, just a network of super supportive folks who believe in you and want you to succeed no matter what? Absolutely! I think many alternative sites&#xa0;<em>should</em>&#xa0;exist on the internet so people can choose an experience that matches their personal preferences and goals. Should Stack build that alternative? Has it already been built? It&#x2019;s an open question; feel free to point out examples in the comments.</p><h3 id="stack-overflow-is-designed-for-practicing-programmers">Stack Overflow is designed for practicing programmers</h3><p>Another point of confusion that comes up a fair bit is who the intended audience for Stack Overflow actually is. That one is straightforward, and it&#x2019;s been the same from day one:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="557" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stackoverflow-for-business-description.png" width="558" /></figure><p>Q&amp;A for&#xa0;<strong>professional and enthusiast programmers</strong>. By that we mean:</p><blockquote>People who either already have a job as a programmer, or could potentially be hired as a programmer today if they wanted to be.</blockquote><p>Yes, in case you&#x2019;re wondering, part of this was an overt business decision. To make money you must have an audience of people already on a programmer&#x2019;s salary, or in the job hunt to be a programmer. The entire Stack Overflow network may be Creative Commons licensed, but it was never a non-profit play. It was planned as a sustainable business from the outset, and that&#x2019;s why&#xa0;we <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stack-overflow-careers-amplifying-your-awesome/">launched Stack Overflow Careers</a>&#xa0;only one year after Stack Overflow itself... to be honest far sooner than we should have, in retrospect. Careers has since been smartly subsumed into Stack Overflow proper at&#xa0;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs" rel="noopener noreferrer">stackoverflow.com/jobs</a>&#xa0;for a more integrated and most assuredly way-better-than-2009 experience.</p><p>The choice of audience wasn&#x2019;t meant to be an exclusionary decision in any way, but Stack Overflow was definitely designed as a fairly strict system of peer review, which is great (IMNSHO, obviously) for already practicing professionals, but&#xa0;<strong>pretty much everything you would&#xa0;<em>not</em>&#xa0;want as a student or beginner</strong>. This is why I cringe so hard I practically turn myself inside out when people on Twitter mention that they have pointed their students at Stack Overflow. What you&#x2019;d want for a beginner or a student in the field of programming is almost&#xa0;<em>the exact opposite</em>&#xa0;of what Stack Overflow does at every turn:</p><ul><li>one-on-one mentoring</li><li>real time collaborative screen sharing</li><li>live chat</li><li>theory and background courses</li><li>starter tasks and exercises</li><li>playgrounds to experiment in</li></ul><p>These are all very fine and good things, but Stack Overflow does&#xa0;<em>NONE</em>&#xa0;of them, by design.</p><p><em>Can</em>&#xa0;you use Stack Overflow to learn how to program from first principles? Well, technically you can do anything with any software. You could try to have actual conversations on Reddit, if you&#x2019;re a masochist. But the answer is yes. You could learn how to program on Stack Overflow, in theory, if you are a prodigy who is comfortable with the light competitive aspects (reputation, closing, downvoting) and also perfectly willing to define all your contributions to the site in terms of utility to others, not just yourself as a student attempting to learn things. But I&#xa0;<em>suuuuuuper</em>&#xa0;would not recommend it. There are&#xa0;far better websites and systems out there for <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/heres-the-programming-game-you-never-asked-for/">learning to be a programmer</a>.&#xa0;<em>Could</em>&#xa0;Stack Overflow build beginner and student friendly systems like this? I don&#x2019;t know, and it&#x2019;s certainly not my call to make. &#x1f914;</p><p>And that&#x2019;s it. We can now resume our normal non-abyss gazing. Or whatever it is that passes for normal in these times.</p><p>I hope all of this doesn&#x2019;t come across as negative. Overall I&#x2019;d say the state of the Stack is strong. But does it even matter what I think?&#xa0;<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/11/25/stack-overflow-is-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As it was in 2008</a>, so it is in 2018.</p><blockquote><strong>Stack Overflow is&#xa0;<em>you</em>.</strong><br /><br />This is the scary part, the great leap of faith that Stack Overflow is predicated on: trusting your fellow programmers. The programmers who choose to participate in Stack Overflow are the &#x201c;secret sauce&#x201d; that makes it work. You are the reason I continue to believe in developer community as the greatest source of learning and growth. You are the reason I continue to get so many positive emails and testimonials about Stack Overflow. I can&#x2019;t take credit for that. But you can.<br /><br />I learned the collective power of my fellow programmers long ago writing on Coding Horror. The community is far, far smarter than I will ever be. All I can ask &#x2014; all any of us can ask &#x2014; is to help each other along the path.<br /><br />And if your fellow programmers decide to recognize you for that, then I say you&#x2019;ve well and truly earned it.</blockquote><p>The strength of Stack Overflow begins, and ends, with the&#xa0;community of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">programmers that power the site</a>.

But let&#x2019;s consider&#xa0;how this email even got sent to its target in the first place:</p><ul><li>An attacker slurped up lists of any public emails of 2008 political campaign staffers.</li><li>One 2008 staffer was&#xa0;<em>also</em>&#xa0;hired for the 2016 political campaign.</li><li>That particular staffer had non-public campaign emails in their address book, and one of them was a powerful key campaign member with an extensive email history.</li></ul><p>On successful phish leads to an even wider address book attack net down the line. Once they gain access to a person&#x2019;s inbox, they use it to prepare to their next attack. They&#x2019;ll harvest existing email addresses, subject lines, content, and attachments to construct plausible looking boobytrapped emails and mail them to all of&#xa0;<em>their</em>&#xa0;contacts. How sophisticated and targeted to a particular person this effort is determines whether it&#x2019;s so-called &#x201c;spear&#x201d; phishing or not.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="742" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/phishing-vs-spear-phishing.png" width="1972" /></figure><p>In this case is it was not at all targeted. This is a remarkably unsophisticated, absolutely generic routine phishing attack. There is zero focused attack effort on display here. But note the target did&#xa0;<em>not</em>&#xa0;immediately click the link in the email!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="989" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-hack-email-link-1.png" width="1696" /></figure><p>Instead, he did exactly what you&#x2019;d want a person to do in this scenario:&#xa0;<strong>he emailed IT support and asked if this email was valid.</strong>&#xa0;But IT made&#xa0;a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html" rel="noreferrer">fatal mistake in their response</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="610" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-it-support-response.png" width="1212" /></figure><p>Do you see it? Here&#x2019;s the kicker:</p><blockquote>Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said&#xa0;<strong>he had meant to type that it was an &#x201c;illegitimate&#x201d; email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.</strong></blockquote><p>One word. He got&#xa0;<em>one</em>&#xa0;word wrong. But what a word to get wrong, and in the first sentence! The email did provide the proper Google address to reset your password. But the lede was already buried since the first sentence said &#x201c;legitimate;&#x201d; the phishing link in that email was then clicked. And the rest is literally history.</p><p>What&#x2019;s even funnier (well, in the way of gallows humor, I guess) is that public stats were left enabled for that bit.ly tracking link, so you can see exactly what crazy domain that &#x201c;Google login page&#x201d; resolved to, and that it was clicked exactly twice, on the same day it was mailed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="715" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/bitly-podesta-tracking-link.png" width="1120" /></figure><p>As I said, these were not exactly sophisticated attackers. So yeah, in&#xa0;<em>theory</em>&#xa0;an attentive user could pay attention to the browser&#x2019;s address bar and notice that after clicking the link, they arrived at</p><p><code>http://myaccount.google.com-securitysettingpage.tk/security/signinoptions/password</code></p><p>instead of</p><p><code>https://myaccount.google.com/security</code></p><p>Note that the phishing URL is carefully constructed so the most &#x201c;correct&#x201d; part is at the front, and weirdness is sandwiched in the middle. Unless you&#x2019;re paying very close attention and your address bar is long enough to expose the full URL, it&#x2019;s&#x2026; tricky.

These three short sentences are the 60 second summary of what you want to do, and what you want to share with others so&#xa0;<em>they</em>&#xa0;do, too.</p><p><strong>1) Enable Two Factor authentication through an app, and&#xa0;<em>not SMS</em>, everywhere you can.</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="481" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/google-2fa-1.png" width="566" /></figure><p>Logging in with only a password, now matter how long and unique you attempt to make that password, will never be enough. A password is what you know; you need to add the second factor of something you&#xa0;<em>have</em>&#xa0;(or something you&#xa0;<em>are</em>) to achieve significant additional security. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/" rel="noreferrer">SMS can famously&#xa0;be intercepted</a>, social engineered, or sim-jacked all too easily. If it&#x2019;s SMS, it&#x2019;s not secure,&#xa0;<em>period</em>. So install an authenticator app, and use it, at least for your most important credentials such as your email account and your bank.</p><p>Have I mentioned that Discourse&#xa0;added <a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2018/05/discourse-2-0-released/" rel="noopener noreferrer">two factor authentication support</a> in version 2.0, and our just released 2.1 adds printed backup codes, too? There are two paths forward: you can&#xa0;<em>talk</em>&#xa0;about the solution, or you can&#xa0;<em>build</em>&#xa0;the solution. I&#x2019;m trying to do both to the best of my ability. Look for the 2FA auth option in your user preferences on your favorite Discourse instance. It&#x2019;s there for you.</p><p>(This is also a company policy at Discourse; if you work here,&#xa0;<em>you 2FA everything all the time</em>. No other login option exists.)</p><p><strong>2) Make all your passwords 11 characters or more.</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/hacker-hack-thyself/">a long story</a>, but anything under 11 characters&#xa0;is basically the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-password-is-too-damn-short/" rel="noreferrer">same as having no password</a> at all&#xa0;these days. I personally recommend at least 14 characters, maybe even 16. But this won&#x2019;t be a problem for you, because...</p><p><strong>3) Use a password manager.</strong></p><p>If you use a password manager, you can simultaneously avoid the pernicious danger of password re-use and&#xa0;the difficulty of coming up with <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/">unique and random passwords</a>&#xa0;all the time. It is my hope in the long run that cloud based password management gets deeply built into Android, iOS, OSX, and Windows so that people don&#x2019;t need to run a weird m&#xe9;lange of third party apps to achieve this essential task. Password management is foundational and should not be the province of third parties on principle, because you never outsource a core competency.</p><p><strong>Bonus rule! For the particularly at-risk, get and use a U2F key.</strong></p><p>In the long term, two factor through an app isn&#x2019;t quite secure enough due to the very real (and growing) specter of real-time phishing. Authentication apps offer timed keys that expire after a minute or two, but if the attacker can get you to type an authentication key and relay it to the target site fast enough, they can still log in as you. If you need ultimate protection,&#xa0;look into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor" rel="noopener noreferrer">U2F keys</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="720" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/u2f-keys.jpg" width="720" /></figure><p>I believe U2F support is still too immature at the moment, particularly on mobile, for this to be practical for the average person right now. But if you do happen to fall into those groups that will be under attack, you&#xa0;<em>absolutely</em>&#xa0;want to set up U2F keys where you can today. They&#x2019;re cheap, and the good news is that they&#xa0;<em>literally make phishing impossible</em>&#xa0;at last. Given that Google had&#xa0;100% company-wide <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">success against phishing with U2F</a>, we know this works.</p><p>In today&#x2019;s world, computers are now so omnipresent that there is no longer any such thing as cybersecurity, online security, or computer security &#x2013; there&#x2019;s only&#xa0;<em>security</em>. You either have it, or you don&#x2019;t. If you follow and share these three rules, hopefully you too can have a modicum of security today.</p>'}]}

There are absolutely occupational hazards of being a programmer, and&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-favorite-programming-quote/">one of my favorite programming quotes</a>&#xa0;is an allusion to one of them:</p><blockquote>It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a&#xa0;<code>DestroyBaghdad</code>&#xa0;procedure.

I don&#x2019;t mean this in a negative way &#x2013; you have to constantly plan for and design around your inevitable human mistakes and fallibility. It&#x2019;s fundamental to good software engineering because, well, we&#x2019;re all human.

But what happens when we&#x2019;re infinitely connected and software is suddenly&#xa0;<em>everywhere</em>, in everyone&#x2019;s pockets every moment of the day, starting to approximate a natural extension of our bodies? All of a sudden those little collective social software accidents become <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-other-tech-bubble/" rel="noreferrer">considerably more dangerous</a>:</p><blockquote>The issue is bigger than any single scandal, I told him. As headlines have exposed the troubling inner workings of company after company, startup culture no longer feels like fodder for gentle parodies about ping pong and hoodies. It feels ugly and rotten. Facebook, the greatest startup success story of this era, isn&#x2019;t a merry band of hackers building cutesy tools that allow you to digitally Poke your friends. It&#x2019;s a powerful and potentially sinister collector of personal data, a propaganda partner to government censors, and an enabler of discriminatory advertising.</blockquote><p>I&#x2019;m reminded of a particular Mitchell and Webb skit:&#xa0;&#x201c;<em>Are we the baddies?&#x201d;</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>On the topic of unanticipated downsides to technology, there is no show more essential than&#xa0;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70264888" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Mirror</a>.

These are very real cautionary tales, and some of this stuff is well on its way toward being realized.</p><p>Programmers don&#x2019;t think of themselves as people with the power to change the world. Most programmers I know, including myself, grew up as nerds, geeks, social outcasts. Did I ever tell you about the time I wrote a self-destructing Apple // boot disk program to let a girl in middle school know that I liked her? I was (and still am) a terrible programmer, but oh man did I ever test the heck out of&#xa0;<em>that</em>&#xa0;code before copying on to her school floppy disc. But I digress. What do you do when you wake up one day and software&#xa0;<em>has</em>&#xa0;kind of eaten the world, and&#xa0;<strong>it is no longer clear if software is in fact an unambiguously good thing, like we thought, like everyone told us&#x2026; like we&#xa0;<em>wanted it to be?</em></strong></p><p>Months ago I submitted a brief interview for a&#xa0;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1465462333/" rel="noreferrer">children&#x2019;s book about coding</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" class="kg-image" height="768" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-34.png" width="598" /></figure><p>I recently received a complimentary copy of the book in the mail.

I had no real recollection of the interview questions after the months of lead time it takes to print a physical book, but reading the printed page, I suddenly hit myself over the head with the very answer I had been searching my soul for these past 6 months:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" class="kg-image" height="201" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-35.png" width="655" /></figure><p>In attempting to simplify my answers for an audience of kids, I had concisely articulated the one thing that keeps me coming back to software:&#xa0;<strong>to serve man</strong>. Not on a platter, for bullshit monetization &#x2013; but <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-just-in-time-theory/" rel="noreferrer">software that&#xa0;helps people</a>&#xa0;be the best version of themselves.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>And you know why I do it? I need that help, too. I get tired, angry, upset, emotional, cranky, irritable, frustrated and I need to be reminded from time to time to choose to be the better version of myself. I don&#x2019;t always succeed. But&#xa0;<em>I want to</em>. And I believe everyone else &#x2013; for some reasonable statistical value of everyone else &#x2013; fundamentally does, too.</p><p>That was the not-so-secret design philosophy behind Stack Overflow, that&#xa0;<strong>by helping others become better programmers, you too would become a better programmer</strong>. It&#x2019;s unavoidable. And, even better, if we leave enough helpful breadcrumbs behind for those that follow us,&#xa0;<em>we collectively advance the whole of programming for everyone</em>.</p><p>I apologize for not blogging much in 2017. I&#x2019;ve certainly been busy with Discourse which is actually going great; we grew to 21 people and&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2017/12/discourse-gives-back-2017/" rel="noopener noreferrer">gave $55,000 back</a>&#xa0;this year to the open source ecosystem we build on. But that&#x2019;s no excuse. The truth is that it&#x2019;s been hard to write because this has been a deeply troubling year in so many dimensions &#x2013; for men, for tech, for American democracy. I&#x2019;m ashamed of much that happened, and I think one of the first and most important steps we can take is to&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-hugging-will-continue-until-morale-improves/">embrace explicit codes of conduct</a>&#xa0;throughout our industry. I also continue to believe, if we start to think more holistically about what our software can do to&#xa0;<strong>serve all people</strong>, not just ourselves personally (or, even worse, the company we work for) &#x2013; that software can and should be part of the solution.</p><p>I tried to amplify on these thoughts in recent podcasts:</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<table><tbody style="margin: 0px;"><tr style="margin: 0px;"><td><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" height="100" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/kim-crayton.jpg" style="margin: 0px; display: block; height: auto;" width="100" /></td><td>&#xa0;<a href="http://www.kimcrayton.com/commengreport-jeff-atwood/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Community Engineering Report</a><span>&#xa0;</span>with Kim Crayton</td></tr><tr style="margin: 0px;"><td><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" height="100" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/dave-rael.jpg" style="margin: 0px; display: block; height: auto;" width="100" /></td><td>&#xa0;<a href="http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-258-jeff-atwood-sharing-the-house" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Developer on Fire</a><span>&#xa0;</span>with Dave Rael</td></tr><tr style="margin: 0px;"><td><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" height="100" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/william-channer.jpg" style="margin: 0px; display: block; height: auto;" width="100" /></td><td>&#xa0;<a href="https://drt.fm/jeff-atwood" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dorm Room Tycoon</a><span>&#xa0;</span>with William Channer</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>Software is easy to change, but people... aren&#x2019;t.

While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step. It takes the grand, operatic elements of Star Wars and grounds them in a reality where power is brutal, where ecological concerns dictate the survival of entire civilizations, and where messiahs are as dangerous as they are revered.</p><p>While Star Wars draws inspiration from many sources, including Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films, and Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey, the imprint of Dune is undeniable. Lucas mixed multiple influences to craft his space opera, resulting in a faster-paced, action-driven narrative compared to Dune’s more introspective and politically complex storytelling. If anything, Dune is a deep meditation on power, religion, and fate, while Star Wars leans into mythic adventure and the battle between good and evil.&nbsp;</p><p>Both have left an indelible mark on science fiction, shaping how we imagine galaxies far, far away.&nbsp;</p><p>Here\'s how the team at <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StarWarsExplained" target="_blank">Star Wars Explained</a></em> put it: <em>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Uz-lKT7Jc" target="_blank">How Dune Continues to Inspire Star Wars.</a>"</em></p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><p>In the end, simply know that for those who fell in love with Star Wars, Dune stands waiting—a richer, more demanding, but ultimately rewarding universe to explore.<br /><br />Further readings:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/star-wars-ripped-off-dune" target="_blank">How \'Star Wars\' ripped off \'Dune\'</a> - via The Week</li><li><a href="https://nerdist.com/article/everything-star-wars-borrowed-from-dune/" target="_blank">Everything STAR WARS Borrowed From DUNE</a> - via Nerdist</li><li><a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars-movies-wouldnt-exist-without-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Movies Definitely Wouldn’t Exist Without Dune</a> - via Den of Geek</li><li><a href="https://www.cbr.com/dune-star-wars-similarities-inspiration/" target="_blank">Dune: 10 Ways the Series Inspired Star Wars</a> - via CBR</li><li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonyorlando52/cool-dune-and-star-wars-comparisons" target="_blank">17 "Star Wars" And "Dune" Similarities That Seemingly Tie The Franchises Together</a> - via BuzzFeed</li><li><a href="https://gamerant.com/star-wars-was-based-on-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Was Based On Dune, And It Shows </a>- via Game Rant</li></ul><p></p></div>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq7tgJpqN-t3AdtgsPbsCw9nr-n-fGT077bVls28t9Lu_zvWivNPoomrDmXU5GKk-rvgPFZM_xSQVq8zWlVCOloEA1_kPCqJQuq2tWcx3bSekID1l8VTebx20UU39KimjohC-qAiYovrOJEqbS1oeajcXre8zQD-PYedtdbDWoUckG6ePMIiTkDQ/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202025-03-05%2008.50.03%20-%20A%20dramatic%20sci-fi%20landscape%20divided%20into%20two%20distinct%20halves,%20symbolizing%20two%20different%20universes.%20On%20the%20left,%20a%20vast%20desert%20planet%20with%20towering%20san.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq7tgJpqN-t3AdtgsPbsCw9nr-n-fGT077bVls28t9Lu_zvWivNPoomrDmXU5GKk-rvgPFZM_xSQVq8zWlVCOloEA1_kPCqJQuq2tWcx3bSekID1l8VTebx20UU39KimjohC-qAiYovrOJEqbS1oeajcXre8zQD-PYedtdbDWoUckG6ePMIiTkDQ/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202025-03-05%2008.50.03%20-%20A%20dramatic%20sci-fi%20landscape%20divided%20into%20two%20distinct%20halves,%20symbolizing%20two%20different%20universes.%20On%20the%20left,%20a%20vast%20desert%20planet%20with%20towering%20san.webp" width="640" /></a></div><br />Frank Herbert’s Dune and George Lucas’ Star Wars share a striking number of similarities, from their world-building to their overarching themes.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess.

Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair. The film is set between Alien and Aliens, with a new cast, a new setting, and—hopefully—a return to the franchise’s roots.</p><p></p><p>Now, full disclosure: I haven’t seen it yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But from what I’ve gathered, early reviews suggest that Álvarez might actually get it. Critics have praised the film for leaning into the claustrophobic horror that made the original Alien so iconic. The visuals are supposedly striking, the tension palpable, and Cailee Spaeny’s performance as the lead, Rain, has been getting solid buzz. If Álvarez managed to capture that creeping dread of the original—without bogging it down in over-explained mythology—then we might just have a winner.</p><p>That said, not all reviews are glowing. Some critics feel the film leans too hard on nostalgia, offering little that’s truly new to the franchise. Others have called out a controversial digital recreation of Ian Holm’s Ash, arguing that it adds more distraction than depth. And there’s always the risk that Romulus ends up feeling like a well-shot rehash rather than a true evolution of the saga.</p><p>So, am I hopeful?&nbsp;</p><p>Cautiously, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like <b>Alien: Romulus</b> might finally be the course correction we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p><p>But I won’t know for sure until I see it myself.&nbsp;</p><p>And when I do, you can bet I’ll be back with my thoughts.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/s1280/Alien(1979).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/w640-h360/Alien(1979).png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p>When Alien burst onto the screen in 1979, it was the kind of film that crawled under your skin and stayed there. A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship?

The film is set between Alien and Aliens, with a new cast, a new setting, and—hopefully—a return to the franchise’s roots.</p><p></p><p>Now, full disclosure: I haven’t seen it yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But from what I’ve gathered, early reviews suggest that Álvarez might actually get it. Critics have praised the film for leaning into the claustrophobic horror that made the original Alien so iconic. The visuals are supposedly striking, the tension palpable, and Cailee Spaeny’s performance as the lead, Rain, has been getting solid buzz. If Álvarez managed to capture that creeping dread of the original—without bogging it down in over-explained mythology—then we might just have a winner.</p><p>That said, not all reviews are glowing. Some critics feel the film leans too hard on nostalgia, offering little that’s truly new to the franchise. Others have called out a controversial digital recreation of Ian Holm’s Ash, arguing that it adds more distraction than depth. And there’s always the risk that Romulus ends up feeling like a well-shot rehash rather than a true evolution of the saga.</p><p>So, am I hopeful?&nbsp;</p><p>Cautiously, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like <b>Alien: Romulus</b> might finally be the course correction we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p><p>But I won’t know for sure until I see it myself.&nbsp;</p><p>And when I do, you can bet I’ll be back with my thoughts.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-alien-or-how.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-alien-or-how.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/s72-w640-h360-c/Alien(1979).png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment. Here’s a summary of all six options to help you decide:</p><ul><li><strong>Craftsman:</strong> Increases natural resources by 25%, providing an edge in resource-heavy builds or for cities situated in resource-poor areas.</li><li><strong>Strategist:</strong> Reduces the likelihood of incidents like fires by 20%, keeping your city safe from disasters that can disrupt growth.</li><li><strong>Trader:</strong> Generates passive income from trade routes, a reliable choice if you plan on focusing on a strong economy.</li><li><strong>Politician:</strong> Allows two additional decrees to be issued at a lower cost, giving you more control over civic policies and faster access to certain upgrades.</li><li><strong>Philosopher:</strong> Boosts cultural satisfaction by 15%, making it easier to attract and retain a happy, thriving population.</li><li><strong>Priest:</strong> Citizens make regular offerings of random resources, adding a steady flow of materials that can supplement your supply chain.</li></ul><p>Each path offers distinct benefits depending on your playstyle. For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city. Here’s how to create a well-rounded cultural hub:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Add the ceramic workshop to a district close to residential zones, maximizing its impact on citizen satisfaction.</li><li>Balance satisfaction areas carefully: Focus on health and creativity early on to keep citizens productive and happy.</li><li>Use decorative statues within districts. Strategically placed statues improve attraction and encourage population growth.</li><li>Expand the radius of cultural buildings. When feasible, prioritize cultural buildings that have a broader impact radius to maximize their effectiveness.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">5. Developing Infrastructure: Production and Trade Routes</h2><p>Setting up trade routes is essential for generating income and balancing resources as your city expands. In the playthrough, the author wisely establishes trade routes to sell excess stone and sand for gold, which funds additional buildings and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>\' trade and production systems:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure to unlock and build both the Horreum, a large storehouse, as well as the Macellum, a large market which will open up Trade Routes. Without these two buildings trade will not be possible.</li><li>Identify surplus resources. Selling excess materials like stone and sand brings in steady gold income, which can be used to fund essential upgrades.</li><li>Upgrade production buildings. Increasing output from woodcutting camps and quarries helps meet the growing demand for building materials.</li><li>Create a balanced workforce. Avoid overspecializing in one resource, which could create shortages elsewhere in your economy.</li><li>Invest in a larger marketplace. Upgrading the marketplace opens up more trade routes, offering new opportunities to exchange goods and expand your economy.</li><li>Manage trade efficiently. Check each route’s profitability and ensure you’re getting maximum value from each transaction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">6. Advanced Growth: Reaching the Tier 2 City</h2><p>As your city grows, upgrading to a Tier 2 city brings new buildings and capabilities, allowing for even greater development. However, this stage also introduces new challenges, such as managing faction tensions. Here are a few ways to make the transition smoothly:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Construct safety-focused buildings. Building structures like arenas can help reduce incidents, which become more likely as factions develop tensions.</li><li>Invest in cultural influence points. Advancing through the ages improves your city’s reputation and allows for higher-level upgrades.</li><li>Manage faction relations. Keep an eye on faction satisfaction levels and address issues before they escalate into conflicts. Certain factions may have different needs or preferences.</li><li>Create additional districts. As new buildings become available, expand your residential and industrial districts to accommodate a growing population.</li><li>Save resources for key upgrades. Some Tier 2 buildings are expensive, so stockpile resources like wood, stone, and gold to avoid delays in construction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">7. Unlocking Wonders and Advanced Cultural Buildings</h2><p>Once you’ve secured your city’s basics, investing in wonders and advanced cultural buildings provides significant boosts. In the video, the author demonstrates how to build high-value structures like the arena and the Agoge Center to enhance influence. Here’s a guide to prioritize wonders effectively:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Focus on the Agoge Center&nbsp;or library to boost cultural influence. These buildings improve city-wide satisfaction and increase your cultural reach.</li><li>Place wonders in high-traffic areas to maximize their impact. Wonders near residential zones offer bonuses to more citizens.</li><li>Consider safety upgrades for wonder districts. Building defensive structures near wonders ensures they’re protected from incidents.</li><li>Save resources for construction. Wonders often require substantial materials, so plan to accumulate what you need before starting.</li><li>Regularly expand surveyor cabins. This allows you to build wonders farther out from the core, increasing your city’s total area.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8. Optimizing Faction Management and Decrees</h2><p>At this stage, you’ll encounter factions with unique demands. Managing these factions carefully, especially if they develop tensions, will become an important of your city management. Use decrees and policies to mitigate conflicts and enhance your city’s stability.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Issue decrees strategically. Certain decrees, such as increased food production, improve citizen satisfaction or reduce faction tensions.</li><li>Manage faction trust levels. High trust prevents conflicts, while low trust increases the likelihood of incidents and disputes.</li><li>Consider faction removal if tensions rise too high. Sometimes, expelling a problematic faction is more beneficial than dealing with constant conflicts.</li><li>Create buffers between rival factions. Placing neutral buildings or parks between contentious factions can reduce interactions and potential conflicts.</li><li>Balance decrees for all factions. Ensure that no single faction feels neglected, as this can quickly lead to dissatisfaction.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2><p>Building a successful city in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;requires a careful blend of resource management, cultural development, and strategic planning.

Between work (or trying to find my next role), family, and the general madness of daily life (soccer practices and games, lifts to here and there, the dog, etc.), finding the time to sit down and really immerse yourself in a game can feel like a luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s where city-building games come in, and let me tell you, they\'ve been a game-changer (pun totally intended).</p><span></span><h3 style="text-align: left;">The Magic of the Pause Button</h3><p>First off, let’s talk about one of the biggest perks of city-building games: the ability to pause or stop the game whenever you need to. Whether you\'re deep into a session of Cities: Skylines meticulously planning the perfect road network or trying to ensure your colonists survive another day in Surviving Mars, you can hit pause and step away without missing a beat. No need to worry about respawning in an FPS firefight or letting your team down in the middle of a MOBA match (I could write a whole posts on all the insults I\'ve taken from World of Tanks players).&nbsp;</p><p>These game wait for you, not the other way around.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Meditative Moments in Gaming</h3><p>Additionally, city-building games offer something incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world: a sense of peace and mindfulness. There’s a certain meditative quality to watching your city grow, whether it\'s a bustling metropolis in Cities: Skylines or a fragile colony on the brink of collapse in Frostpunk. You’re not just reacting to what’s happening on screen; you’re crafting something from the ground up, watching your creation evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s like a digital Zen garden, where each decision is a small stone you’re placing just so, bringing order to the chaos. Oh the hundreds of hours I\'ve spent in my Cities Skylines cities, beautifying them with parks, trees and endless landscaping.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Building Something That Lasts (well, sorta)</h3><p>Speaking of crafting, there’s something deeply satisfying about the “building something” aspect of these games. Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge. It’s not about speed or reflexes; it’s about foresight, planning, and adaptability. In Frostpunk, for example, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death for your citizens, adding a layer of moral complexity to the game. It’s a challenge that’s less about adrenaline and more about thoughtful consideration—a welcome break from the usual high-octane fare.</p><p>City-building games like Cities: Skylines, Farthest Frontier, Per Aspera, Frostpunk, and Surviving Mars offer a unique blend of strategy, relaxation, and creativity that’s perfect for casual gamers, especially gamer dads.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re games you can pick up and put down at your convenience, offering a sense of accomplishment without the stress. So next time you’re looking for a game that fits into your busy life, consider giving one of these a try.&nbsp;</p><p>You might just find it’s exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" width="640" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><br /></p><p>Here\'s a short list of some of the games I\'ve enjoyed over the years:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about" target="_blank"><i>Cities: Skylines II</i></a>&nbsp;(2023) - The sequel to the highly acclaimed Cities: Skylines, this game takes city-building to new heights with more advanced tools, deeper simulation, and enhanced graphics.</li><li><a href="https://www.farthestfrontier.com/" target="_blank"><i>Farthest Frontier</i></a> (2022) - A survival city-builder where you manage a frontier settlement, focusing on resource management, farming, and surviving harsh conditions.</li><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/surviving-the-aftermath/about" target="_blank"><i>Surviving the Aftermath</i></a> (2021) - A post-apocalyptic city-builder where you lead a group of survivors to rebuild society after a global catastrophe.</li><li><em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em> (2024) is a city-building game where you guide a city through 2,500 years of history across four eras.

It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge. It’s not about speed or reflexes; it’s about foresight, planning, and adaptability. In Frostpunk, for example, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death for your citizens, adding a layer of moral complexity to the game. It’s a challenge that’s less about adrenaline and more about thoughtful consideration—a welcome break from the usual high-octane fare.</p><p>City-building games like Cities: Skylines, Farthest Frontier, Per Aspera, Frostpunk, and Surviving Mars offer a unique blend of strategy, relaxation, and creativity that’s perfect for casual gamers, especially gamer dads.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re games you can pick up and put down at your convenience, offering a sense of accomplishment without the stress. So next time you’re looking for a game that fits into your busy life, consider giving one of these a try.&nbsp;</p><p>You might just find it’s exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" width="640" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><br /></p><p>Here\'s a short list of some of the games I\'ve enjoyed over the years:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about" target="_blank"><i>Cities: Skylines II</i></a>&nbsp;(2023) - The sequel to the highly acclaimed Cities: Skylines, this game takes city-building to new heights with more advanced tools, deeper simulation, and enhanced graphics.</li><li><a href="https://www.farthestfrontier.com/" target="_blank"><i>Farthest Frontier</i></a> (2022) - A survival city-builder where you manage a frontier settlement, focusing on resource management, farming, and surviving harsh conditions.</li><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/surviving-the-aftermath/about" target="_blank"><i>Surviving the Aftermath</i></a> (2021) - A post-apocalyptic city-builder where you lead a group of survivors to rebuild society after a global catastrophe.</li><li><em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em> (2024) is a city-building game where you guide a city through 2,500 years of history across four eras.

Someone with extensive experience piloting TDs would likely tell you that the following are the best setups, crew skills, and playstyle strategies to help your team secure victory.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Vehicle Setup in Detail</h3><h4 style="text-align: left;">Equipment Choices</h4><p>For both the Hellcat and Super Hellcat, the goal is to maximize their strengths: mobility, concealment, and firepower.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Optics (Binocular Telescope or Coated Optics)</b>: Increasing your view range is critical. Spotting enemies before they spot you allows you to make informed decisions on when to shoot and when to relocate. The choice between Binocular Telescope and Coated Optics depends on your playstyle; Binoculars for more stationary play and Coated Optics for more active scouting and repositioning.</li><li><b>Gun Rammer</b>: Reducing your reload time significantly increases your Damage Per Minute (DPM), making you a bigger threat on the battlefield. Being able to shoot more frequently means you can exploit enemy tanks\' vulnerabilities more often.</li><li><b>Camo Net / Turbocharger</b>: The choice here is between enhancing your stealth with a Camo Net or boosting your mobility with a Turbocharger. The Hellcat, being slightly more geared towards ambush tactics, benefits greatly from a Camo Net. The Super Hellcat, with its enhanced mobility, can further capitalize on this with a Turbocharger, allowing for rapid repositioning and flanking maneuvers.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;">Crew Skills in Detail</h3><p>Developing your crew skills is crucial for maximizing the potential of your TDs.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Commander</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Sixth Sense</b> is non-negotiable for TDs. Knowing when you\'ve been spotted can save you from being quickly eliminated.</li><li><b>Recon</b> further boosts your view range, complementing your equipment choices.</li></ul><li><b>Gunner</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> makes you harder to detect, a key survival trait for a TD.</li><li><b>Snap Shot</b> improves your gun\'s accuracy during turret movements, allowing for more reliable shots after repositioning.</li></ul><li><b>Driver</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Smooth Ride</b> reduces the accuracy penalty when firing on the move, which can be beneficial in hit-and-run tactics.</li><li><b>Off-Road Driving</b> improves your mobility on various terrains, enhancing your ability to quickly get into position or escape danger.</li></ul><li><b>Loader</b>: If your TD has a dedicated loader,</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> further enhances your stealth.</li><li><b>Safe Stowage</b> increases the durability of your ammo rack, reducing the chance of being taken out by a single hit.</li></ul></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Super Hellcat | World of Tanks Best Replays</h2><div style="text-align: center;"></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Gameplay Tactics in Detail</h2><h4 style="text-align: left;">Early Game</h4><p>The initial phase of the match is about gathering intelligence and taking key positions without being overly aggressive.</p><p><b>Scout and Reposition</b>: Use your mobility to reach forward positions quickly. Your goal is to gather as much information as possible on enemy movements for your team. After spotting, fall back to a safe distance before engaging.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Mid to Late Game</h4><p>As the match progresses, your role shifts towards exploiting enemy weaknesses and supporting your team from the second line.</p><p><b>Hit and Run</b>: Identify isolated targets or support teammates by targeting enemies focused on your allies. After firing, immediately relocate to avoid counter-fire, especially from enemy artillery or hidden TDs.</p><p><b>Supporting Heavies</b>: Position yourself behind or beside your team’s heavy tanks. From here, you can safely engage enemies that are distracted by your frontline, using your superior DPM to whittle them down.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Map Movement and Positioning</h3><p>Understanding each map\'s key features and sight lines is crucial. Use terrain to your advantage, keeping in mind that your primary goal is to support your team by dealing damage from concealed positions or by exploiting enemy flanks.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Use Terrain: Always be mindful of hills, ridges, and other terrain features that can provide cover or concealment. Being able to shoot without exposing your tank is a key skill for TD players.</li><li>Avoid Open Fields: Open areas are death zones for lightly armored vehicles like the Hellcat and Super Hellcat. Move from cover to cover and stay aware of potential threats like enemy TDs and artillery.</li><li>High Ground Advantage: High ground not only provides a better view of the battlefield but also makes it harder for enemies to hit your tank. Use elevation to your advantage whenever possible.</li></ul><p></p><p>By focusing on these strategies and continuously practicing and refining your skills, you\'ll greatly contribute to your team\'s efforts and enjoy success in your Hellcat and Super Hellcat in World of Tanks.</p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How a Super Hellcat should tag along with...</h2><div><span><div>The Hellcat, with its blend of mobility, firepower, and limited armor, can significantly benefit from coordinating with certain types of vehicles on the battlefield. Here’s a breakdown of which vehicles a Hellcat should consider partnering with and why:</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Medium Tanks</h3><div>Medium tanks are versatile and can perform a wide range of roles, making them excellent partners for the Hellcat. Their balance of speed, armor, and firepower allows them to effectively scout, flank, and engage enemies at various ranges. A Hellcat can support medium tanks by providing additional firepower from a second line or by exploiting openings created by the mediums’ aggressive maneuvers. This pairing can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions, moving to support weakened flanks or to capitalize on enemy vulnerabilities.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heavy Tanks</h3><div>While heavy tanks lack the Hellcat’s mobility, they make up for it with superior armor and firepower. Teaming up with heavy tanks allows the Hellcat to operate from behind the frontline, using the heavies as a shield while it delivers precise shots. This partnership is especially effective in areas with good cover and long sightlines, where the Hellcat can use its excellent gun to support the heavy tanks without exposing itself to enemy fire. The Hellcat should avoid blocking the retreat paths of allied heavy tanks and remain ready to reposition if the enemy breaks through the frontline.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Other TDs</h3><div>Pairing with other TDs, especially those with strong frontal armor, can create a formidable defensive line that can deter enemy advances. The Hellcat, with its good mobility, can act as a scout or flanker for this group, identifying targets for the more heavily armored TDs to engage. However, this requires good communication and coordination to ensure that the Hellcat does not become isolated or targeted by enemy artillery.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Artillery</h3><div>While not directly tagging along with artillery, a Hellcat can play a crucial role in protecting these valuable assets from enemy scouts and light tanks. By staying relatively close to friendly artillery, the Hellcat can use its mobility and firepower to intercept and eliminate threats to the team’s artillery pieces, ensuring they can continue to support the team effectively.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Light Tanks</h3><div>A somewhat less common but potentially effective partnership can be formed with light tanks. Light tanks excel in scouting and can quickly identify key enemy positions. A Hellcat following a light tank at a safe distance can capitalize on the scouting information, using its accurate gun to take out spotted enemies before they can react. However, this requires the Hellcat to stay alert and ready to move, as the light tank’s fast-paced scouting can lead them into rapidly changing situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>When pairing with any vehicle, the key for the Hellcat driver is to maintain situational awareness and adapt to the battle’s flow. The Hellcat\'s strength lies in its ability to deliver impactful damage from positions where it is not easily targeted. Effective communication with teammates and choosing the right moments to strike or relocate are crucial for leveraging the Hellcat’s capabilities to their fullest.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">How NOT to play the Super Hellcat!</h2></span></div><p style="text-align: left;">One of the worst ways to play the Hellcat in World of Tanks is to treat it like a frontline brawler or a heavy tank. The Hellcat is equipped with a powerful gun and excellent mobility but suffers from very thin armor and a relatively open turret design, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fire from almost all types of weapons it encounters on the battlefield.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Mistakes in Playing the Hellcat as a Frontline Tank:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Engaging in Direct Firefights: Attempting to trade shots with enemy tanks, especially heavies or well-armored mediums and TDs, is a quick way to get destroyed. The Hellcat\'s armor is insufficient to absorb hits, and its relatively large profile for a TD makes it an easy target when exposed.</li><li>Ignoring Cover and Concealment: Failing to use the terrain, bushes, and other forms of cover to hide your tank and mask your movements negates one of the Hellcat\'s main strengths – its ability to strike unseen. Being visible on the front lines means you\'ll likely be one of the first targets to be fired upon.</li><li>Static Gameplay: Staying in one position for too long, especially on the front lines, can make you an easy target for enemy artillery and tanks. The Hellcat thrives on its ability to relocate quickly, providing support where it\'s needed and avoiding return fire.</li><li>Not Using its Mobility: The Hellcat\'s speed is a key feature that allows it to flex across the map, responding to threats, reinforcing failing flanks, or exploiting gaps in the enemy lines. Playing it in a stationary, frontline role wastes this potential, making the tank much less effective than it could be.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Avoid These Mistakes:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Play to Your Strengths: Use the Hellcat\'s mobility and excellent gun handling to engage enemies from unexpected angles, relocate frequently to avoid being targeted, and always look for opportunities to support your team from a distance or the second line.</li><li>Stay Aware: Keep an eye on the mini-map and be ready to move if you\'re in danger of being flanked, or if there\'s a more advantageous position you can take to support your team.</li><li>Engage Wisely: Choose your battles carefully. Look for targets that are engaged with your teammates, isolated, or presenting their weaker armor to you. Avoid head-on engagements with tanks that can easily outgun or outarmor you.</li></ul><p></p><p>By avoiding the frontline brawler playstyle and focusing on mobility, stealth, and strategic engagement, you\'ll greatly increase your effectiveness and survivability in the Hellcat, turning it into a formidable asset for your team.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final thoughts...</h2><p>Mastering the Hellcat and Super Hellcat requires patience, good positioning, and an understanding of when to engage or retreat. Remember, your primary role is to support your team by providing accurate and timely damage from a distance or flanking. Avoid direct confrontations with heavier tanks unless you have a clear advantage or support. By following these strategies and adjusting your playstyle based on the battle\'s flow, you\'ll become a valuable asset to your team and help secure victory on the battlefield.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p>Jumping back into World of Tanks after long hiatus, and a big update felt a bit like a cold splash of water yesterday - especially when I dove straight into battle with my Super Hellcat and ended up more like a skittish kitten hiding in the bushes (literally) than the fierce TD I should\'ve been.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, my gameplay was rusty, and the match didn’t go well at all.

While Fincher\'s film has gained appreciation over time for its atmospheric and stylistic contributions to the franchise, Gibson\'s unproduced screenplay remains a fascinating "what if" scenario that hints at a different direction the "Alien" saga could have taken, potentially offering a more direct continuation of the themes and characters that fans had grown to love in the first two films.</div><div><p></p><p><a href="https://www.audible.ca/pd/Alien-III-Audiobook/B07QWZH5J6?bp_o=true&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAt5euBhB9EiwAdkXWOzX75ZpJJpU6Dii1CcYZWuvJqkjite68jE0tYKh79hvBv7VOWtw46xoCvOgQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;ipRedirectOverride=true&amp;language=en_CA&amp;overrideBaseCountry=true&amp;source_code=GDGPP30DTRIAL548011723005L" target="_blank">Audible\'s audio drama Alien 3 was a brilliant dramatization of the Gibson screenplay</a>, and I highly recommend you give it a listen!</p></div></div>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/exploring-what-if-review-of-william.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/exploring-what-if-review-of-william.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijZHVqQ4oyLsuTd86BXSKGK7ouqMc8C27X9MnhsA4O-V34biRXo4AP55knQnbagEaStNOzUUy4IXGMA_e_YWULmNyD1v5r_Gp7k5smPivZITfQaALFI4CjVeC7Jdop5DvN7NUMB9VoLs4Ozxh4xw2qL4YCJry9GqUMaiplxGjNOOrKANt6D5_2hg/s72-w640-h360-c/Sigourney-Weaver-and-xenomorph-in-Alien-3.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}
