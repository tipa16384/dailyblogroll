While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step. It takes the grand, operatic elements of Star Wars and grounds them in a reality where power is brutal, where ecological concerns dictate the survival of entire civilizations, and where messiahs are as dangerous as they are revered.</p><p>While Star Wars draws inspiration from many sources, including Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films, and Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey, the imprint of Dune is undeniable. Lucas mixed multiple influences to craft his space opera, resulting in a faster-paced, action-driven narrative compared to Dune’s more introspective and politically complex storytelling.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened.

Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened. That bizarre, campy mess deserves to be locked in a vault and yeeted into a black hole. A clone-Ripley with alien DNA? A Xenomorph with puppy dog eyes? No thanks. Some things are best left unacknowledged.</i>).&nbsp;</p><p>And then, decades later, Ridley Scott returned. He promised to answer those burning questions we’d had since Alien.

Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment.

For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city. Here’s how to create a well-rounded cultural hub:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Add the ceramic workshop to a district close to residential zones, maximizing its impact on citizen satisfaction.</li><li>Balance satisfaction areas carefully: Focus on health and creativity early on to keep citizens productive and happy.</li><li>Use decorative statues within districts. Strategically placed statues improve attraction and encourage population growth.</li><li>Expand the radius of cultural buildings. When feasible, prioritize cultural buildings that have a broader impact radius to maximize their effectiveness.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">5. Developing Infrastructure: Production and Trade Routes</h2><p>Setting up trade routes is essential for generating income and balancing resources as your city expands. In the playthrough, the author wisely establishes trade routes to sell excess stone and sand for gold, which funds additional buildings and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>\' trade and production systems:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure to unlock and build both the Horreum, a large storehouse, as well as the Macellum, a large market which will open up Trade Routes. Without these two buildings trade will not be possible.</li><li>Identify surplus resources. Selling excess materials like stone and sand brings in steady gold income, which can be used to fund essential upgrades.</li><li>Upgrade production buildings. Increasing output from woodcutting camps and quarries helps meet the growing demand for building materials.</li><li>Create a balanced workforce. Avoid overspecializing in one resource, which could create shortages elsewhere in your economy.</li><li>Invest in a larger marketplace. Upgrading the marketplace opens up more trade routes, offering new opportunities to exchange goods and expand your economy.</li><li>Manage trade efficiently. Check each route’s profitability and ensure you’re getting maximum value from each transaction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">6. Advanced Growth: Reaching the Tier 2 City</h2><p>As your city grows, upgrading to a Tier 2 city brings new buildings and capabilities, allowing for even greater development. However, this stage also introduces new challenges, such as managing faction tensions. Here are a few ways to make the transition smoothly:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Construct safety-focused buildings. Building structures like arenas can help reduce incidents, which become more likely as factions develop tensions.</li><li>Invest in cultural influence points. Advancing through the ages improves your city’s reputation and allows for higher-level upgrades.</li><li>Manage faction relations. Keep an eye on faction satisfaction levels and address issues before they escalate into conflicts. Certain factions may have different needs or preferences.</li><li>Create additional districts. As new buildings become available, expand your residential and industrial districts to accommodate a growing population.</li><li>Save resources for key upgrades. Some Tier 2 buildings are expensive, so stockpile resources like wood, stone, and gold to avoid delays in construction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">7. Unlocking Wonders and Advanced Cultural Buildings</h2><p>Once you’ve secured your city’s basics, investing in wonders and advanced cultural buildings provides significant boosts. In the video, the author demonstrates how to build high-value structures like the arena and the Agoge Center to enhance influence. Here’s a guide to prioritize wonders effectively:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Focus on the Agoge Center&nbsp;or library to boost cultural influence. These buildings improve city-wide satisfaction and increase your cultural reach.</li><li>Place wonders in high-traffic areas to maximize their impact. Wonders near residential zones offer bonuses to more citizens.</li><li>Consider safety upgrades for wonder districts. Building defensive structures near wonders ensures they’re protected from incidents.</li><li>Save resources for construction. Wonders often require substantial materials, so plan to accumulate what you need before starting.</li><li>Regularly expand surveyor cabins. This allows you to build wonders farther out from the core, increasing your city’s total area.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8. Optimizing Faction Management and Decrees</h2><p>At this stage, you’ll encounter factions with unique demands. Managing these factions carefully, especially if they develop tensions, will become an important of your city management. Use decrees and policies to mitigate conflicts and enhance your city’s stability.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Issue decrees strategically. Certain decrees, such as increased food production, improve citizen satisfaction or reduce faction tensions.</li><li>Manage faction trust levels. High trust prevents conflicts, while low trust increases the likelihood of incidents and disputes.</li><li>Consider faction removal if tensions rise too high. Sometimes, expelling a problematic faction is more beneficial than dealing with constant conflicts.</li><li>Create buffers between rival factions. Placing neutral buildings or parks between contentious factions can reduce interactions and potential conflicts.</li><li>Balance decrees for all factions. Ensure that no single faction feels neglected, as this can quickly lead to dissatisfaction.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2><p>Building a successful city in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;requires a careful blend of resource management, cultural development, and strategic planning.

Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment.

Between work (or trying to find my next role), family, and the general madness of daily life (soccer practices and games, lifts to here and there, the dog, etc.), finding the time to sit down and really immerse yourself in a game can feel like a luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s where city-building games come in, and let me tell you, they\'ve been a game-changer (pun totally intended).</p><span></span><h3 style="text-align: left;">The Magic of the Pause Button</h3><p>First off, let’s talk about one of the biggest perks of city-building games: the ability to pause or stop the game whenever you need to. Whether you\'re deep into a session of Cities: Skylines meticulously planning the perfect road network or trying to ensure your colonists survive another day in Surviving Mars, you can hit pause and step away without missing a beat. No need to worry about respawning in an FPS firefight or letting your team down in the middle of a MOBA match (I could write a whole posts on all the insults I\'ve taken from World of Tanks players).&nbsp;</p><p>These game wait for you, not the other way around.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Meditative Moments in Gaming</h3><p>Additionally, city-building games offer something incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world: a sense of peace and mindfulness. There’s a certain meditative quality to watching your city grow, whether it\'s a bustling metropolis in Cities: Skylines or a fragile colony on the brink of collapse in Frostpunk. You’re not just reacting to what’s happening on screen; you’re crafting something from the ground up, watching your creation evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s like a digital Zen garden, where each decision is a small stone you’re placing just so, bringing order to the chaos. Oh the hundreds of hours I\'ve spent in my Cities Skylines cities, beautifying them with parks, trees and endless landscaping.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Building Something That Lasts (well, sorta)</h3><p>Speaking of crafting, there’s something deeply satisfying about the “building something” aspect of these games. Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge.

Someone with extensive experience piloting TDs would likely tell you that the following are the best setups, crew skills, and playstyle strategies to help your team secure victory.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Vehicle Setup in Detail</h3><h4 style="text-align: left;">Equipment Choices</h4><p>For both the Hellcat and Super Hellcat, the goal is to maximize their strengths: mobility, concealment, and firepower.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Optics (Binocular Telescope or Coated Optics)</b>: Increasing your view range is critical. Spotting enemies before they spot you allows you to make informed decisions on when to shoot and when to relocate. The choice between Binocular Telescope and Coated Optics depends on your playstyle; Binoculars for more stationary play and Coated Optics for more active scouting and repositioning.</li><li><b>Gun Rammer</b>: Reducing your reload time significantly increases your Damage Per Minute (DPM), making you a bigger threat on the battlefield. Being able to shoot more frequently means you can exploit enemy tanks\' vulnerabilities more often.</li><li><b>Camo Net / Turbocharger</b>: The choice here is between enhancing your stealth with a Camo Net or boosting your mobility with a Turbocharger. The Hellcat, being slightly more geared towards ambush tactics, benefits greatly from a Camo Net. The Super Hellcat, with its enhanced mobility, can further capitalize on this with a Turbocharger, allowing for rapid repositioning and flanking maneuvers.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;">Crew Skills in Detail</h3><p>Developing your crew skills is crucial for maximizing the potential of your TDs.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Commander</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Sixth Sense</b> is non-negotiable for TDs. Knowing when you\'ve been spotted can save you from being quickly eliminated.</li><li><b>Recon</b> further boosts your view range, complementing your equipment choices.</li></ul><li><b>Gunner</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> makes you harder to detect, a key survival trait for a TD.</li><li><b>Snap Shot</b> improves your gun\'s accuracy during turret movements, allowing for more reliable shots after repositioning.</li></ul><li><b>Driver</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Smooth Ride</b> reduces the accuracy penalty when firing on the move, which can be beneficial in hit-and-run tactics.</li><li><b>Off-Road Driving</b> improves your mobility on various terrains, enhancing your ability to quickly get into position or escape danger.</li></ul><li><b>Loader</b>: If your TD has a dedicated loader,</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> further enhances your stealth.</li><li><b>Safe Stowage</b> increases the durability of your ammo rack, reducing the chance of being taken out by a single hit.</li></ul></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Super Hellcat | World of Tanks Best Replays</h2><div style="text-align: center;"></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Gameplay Tactics in Detail</h2><h4 style="text-align: left;">Early Game</h4><p>The initial phase of the match is about gathering intelligence and taking key positions without being overly aggressive.</p><p><b>Scout and Reposition</b>: Use your mobility to reach forward positions quickly. Your goal is to gather as much information as possible on enemy movements for your team. After spotting, fall back to a safe distance before engaging.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Mid to Late Game</h4><p>As the match progresses, your role shifts towards exploiting enemy weaknesses and supporting your team from the second line.</p><p><b>Hit and Run</b>: Identify isolated targets or support teammates by targeting enemies focused on your allies. After firing, immediately relocate to avoid counter-fire, especially from enemy artillery or hidden TDs.</p><p><b>Supporting Heavies</b>: Position yourself behind or beside your team’s heavy tanks. From here, you can safely engage enemies that are distracted by your frontline, using your superior DPM to whittle them down.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Map Movement and Positioning</h3><p>Understanding each map\'s key features and sight lines is crucial. Use terrain to your advantage, keeping in mind that your primary goal is to support your team by dealing damage from concealed positions or by exploiting enemy flanks.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Use Terrain: Always be mindful of hills, ridges, and other terrain features that can provide cover or concealment. Being able to shoot without exposing your tank is a key skill for TD players.</li><li>Avoid Open Fields: Open areas are death zones for lightly armored vehicles like the Hellcat and Super Hellcat. Move from cover to cover and stay aware of potential threats like enemy TDs and artillery.</li><li>High Ground Advantage: High ground not only provides a better view of the battlefield but also makes it harder for enemies to hit your tank. Use elevation to your advantage whenever possible.</li></ul><p></p><p>By focusing on these strategies and continuously practicing and refining your skills, you\'ll greatly contribute to your team\'s efforts and enjoy success in your Hellcat and Super Hellcat in World of Tanks.</p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How a Super Hellcat should tag along with...</h2><div><span><div>The Hellcat, with its blend of mobility, firepower, and limited armor, can significantly benefit from coordinating with certain types of vehicles on the battlefield. Here’s a breakdown of which vehicles a Hellcat should consider partnering with and why:</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Medium Tanks</h3><div>Medium tanks are versatile and can perform a wide range of roles, making them excellent partners for the Hellcat. Their balance of speed, armor, and firepower allows them to effectively scout, flank, and engage enemies at various ranges. A Hellcat can support medium tanks by providing additional firepower from a second line or by exploiting openings created by the mediums’ aggressive maneuvers. This pairing can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions, moving to support weakened flanks or to capitalize on enemy vulnerabilities.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heavy Tanks</h3><div>While heavy tanks lack the Hellcat’s mobility, they make up for it with superior armor and firepower. Teaming up with heavy tanks allows the Hellcat to operate from behind the frontline, using the heavies as a shield while it delivers precise shots. This partnership is especially effective in areas with good cover and long sightlines, where the Hellcat can use its excellent gun to support the heavy tanks without exposing itself to enemy fire. The Hellcat should avoid blocking the retreat paths of allied heavy tanks and remain ready to reposition if the enemy breaks through the frontline.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Other TDs</h3><div>Pairing with other TDs, especially those with strong frontal armor, can create a formidable defensive line that can deter enemy advances. The Hellcat, with its good mobility, can act as a scout or flanker for this group, identifying targets for the more heavily armored TDs to engage. However, this requires good communication and coordination to ensure that the Hellcat does not become isolated or targeted by enemy artillery.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Artillery</h3><div>While not directly tagging along with artillery, a Hellcat can play a crucial role in protecting these valuable assets from enemy scouts and light tanks. By staying relatively close to friendly artillery, the Hellcat can use its mobility and firepower to intercept and eliminate threats to the team’s artillery pieces, ensuring they can continue to support the team effectively.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Light Tanks</h3><div>A somewhat less common but potentially effective partnership can be formed with light tanks. Light tanks excel in scouting and can quickly identify key enemy positions. A Hellcat following a light tank at a safe distance can capitalize on the scouting information, using its accurate gun to take out spotted enemies before they can react. However, this requires the Hellcat to stay alert and ready to move, as the light tank’s fast-paced scouting can lead them into rapidly changing situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>When pairing with any vehicle, the key for the Hellcat driver is to maintain situational awareness and adapt to the battle’s flow. The Hellcat\'s strength lies in its ability to deliver impactful damage from positions where it is not easily targeted. Effective communication with teammates and choosing the right moments to strike or relocate are crucial for leveraging the Hellcat’s capabilities to their fullest.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">How NOT to play the Super Hellcat!</h2></span></div><p style="text-align: left;">One of the worst ways to play the Hellcat in World of Tanks is to treat it like a frontline brawler or a heavy tank. The Hellcat is equipped with a powerful gun and excellent mobility but suffers from very thin armor and a relatively open turret design, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fire from almost all types of weapons it encounters on the battlefield.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Mistakes in Playing the Hellcat as a Frontline Tank:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Engaging in Direct Firefights: Attempting to trade shots with enemy tanks, especially heavies or well-armored mediums and TDs, is a quick way to get destroyed. The Hellcat\'s armor is insufficient to absorb hits, and its relatively large profile for a TD makes it an easy target when exposed.</li><li>Ignoring Cover and Concealment: Failing to use the terrain, bushes, and other forms of cover to hide your tank and mask your movements negates one of the Hellcat\'s main strengths – its ability to strike unseen. Being visible on the front lines means you\'ll likely be one of the first targets to be fired upon.</li><li>Static Gameplay: Staying in one position for too long, especially on the front lines, can make you an easy target for enemy artillery and tanks. The Hellcat thrives on its ability to relocate quickly, providing support where it\'s needed and avoiding return fire.</li><li>Not Using its Mobility: The Hellcat\'s speed is a key feature that allows it to flex across the map, responding to threats, reinforcing failing flanks, or exploiting gaps in the enemy lines. Playing it in a stationary, frontline role wastes this potential, making the tank much less effective than it could be.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Avoid These Mistakes:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Play to Your Strengths: Use the Hellcat\'s mobility and excellent gun handling to engage enemies from unexpected angles, relocate frequently to avoid being targeted, and always look for opportunities to support your team from a distance or the second line.</li><li>Stay Aware: Keep an eye on the mini-map and be ready to move if you\'re in danger of being flanked, or if there\'s a more advantageous position you can take to support your team.</li><li>Engage Wisely: Choose your battles carefully. Look for targets that are engaged with your teammates, isolated, or presenting their weaker armor to you. Avoid head-on engagements with tanks that can easily outgun or outarmor you.</li></ul><p></p><p>By avoiding the frontline brawler playstyle and focusing on mobility, stealth, and strategic engagement, you\'ll greatly increase your effectiveness and survivability in the Hellcat, turning it into a formidable asset for your team.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final thoughts...</h2><p>Mastering the Hellcat and Super Hellcat requires patience, good positioning, and an understanding of when to engage or retreat. Remember, your primary role is to support your team by providing accurate and timely damage from a distance or flanking. Avoid direct confrontations with heavier tanks unless you have a clear advantage or support. By following these strategies and adjusting your playstyle based on the battle\'s flow, you\'ll become a valuable asset to your team and help secure victory on the battlefield.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p>Jumping back into World of Tanks after long hiatus, and a big update felt a bit like a cold splash of water yesterday - especially when I dove straight into battle with my Super Hellcat and ended up more like a skittish kitten hiding in the bushes (literally) than the fierce TD I should\'ve been.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, my gameplay was rusty, and the match didn’t go well at all.

Put in the language of our political moment, San Francisco\'s halls of power are awash with Abundance. Not coincidentally, San Franciscans are suffering more than ever in just about every measurable way, and City Hall is simply ignoring their plight. [...] <p>San Franciscans are highly preoccupied with Trump\'s shocking and constant attacks on democracy, ICE raids disappearing of our neighbors, and exacerbation of the two-year-long genocide in Gaza. Mayor Lurie barely acknowledges these issues. In contrast to big city mayors like Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee, and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Lurie refuses to take a stand against ICE kidnappings and his police department won\'t even protect those who do. Outrageously, SFPD\'s stated position is that its priority is to protect <i>ICE agents</i> from <i>protestors.</i> <p>This is a stunning lack of leadership for a Democratic mayor in a sanctuary city widely considered to be the nation\'s progressive heartland, at the precise moment when American fascism begs confrontation. But even more squarely on the plate of San Francisco\'s current leaders is the fact that local economic conditions have rapidly deteriorated for the city\'s working people and poor in the short time since they came into power.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2025/08/danny-bluejeans-loves-cars/">Previously</a>, <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2025/08/sfpd-surveillance-units-close-ties-to-crypto-billionaire/">previously</a>, <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2025/10/the-worst-person-you-know-just-made-a-great-point/">previously</a>, <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2025/03/lest-we-forget-the-horrors-part-2/">previously</a>.'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://cdn.jwz.org/blog/2025/10/democrats-new-abundance-platform-isnt-playing-out-well-in-san-francisco/feed/', 'slash_comments': '11'}

Less than you\'d think:</a> <p><blockquote style="margin: 1em 0 1em 1.5em; padding: 0.75em 0.5em 0.75em 1em; border: 1px solid; border-left: 4px solid;"> <p>Following an uproar, Benioff backpedaled on his call to send in the troops, saying he only wanted to aid San Francisco\'s understaffed police force. He also added that Salesforce paid for an additional 200 off-duty law-enforcement officers to essentially work Dreamforce security. <p>But how much does Salesforce pay? The amount the company spent on San Francisco officers was about $1 million in overtime costs over the past 18 months, according to invoices obtained in a public records request. <p>Last year, Salesforce grossed just shy of $35 billion. That $1 million outlay represents 0.02 percent of the company\'s net income of $4.1 billion. <p>The payments were made through the city\'s 10(b) program, in which private employers can hire off-duty officers as security. Between 2018 and 2023, Salesforce was a top-five employer of off-duty San Francisco cops, paying for 30,911 hours of overtime work. That\'s more than Target, Safeway or Bank of America but less than Lululemon, the Giants or the No. 1 10(b) employer, Walgreen\'s. [...] <p>But Benioff bemoaning current private security costs puzzled law-enforcement sources, who noted that Salesforce has been staffed by a host of San Francisco police officers for years. These hefty deployments, including SWAT teams, counter-sniper teams, plainclothes officers and roaming and fixed-post patrol officers, came whether the department was fully staffed or, as in the present, understaffed. [...] <p>Officers Mission Local spoke with rejected the notion of bringing in the National Guard -- which, by law, cannot undertake the duties of local police. <p>"A local cop is beholden to the rules and regulations of the city they work for," said one. He is not ordered to "\'go grab Brown people\' or \'go beat up hippies.\'"</blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/salesforce-benioff-ice.html"> But his allegiance to Mr. Trump goes much further:</a> <p><blockquote style="margin: 1em 0 1em 1.5em; padding: 0.75em 0.5em 0.75em 1em; border: 1px solid; border-left: 4px solid;"> Screenshots of internal documents and communications obtained by The New York Times show that Salesforce has pitched Immigration and Customs Enforcement on using the company’s artificial intelligence capabilities to help ICE staff up as Mr. Trump expands immigration raids and deportations around the country. </blockquote> <p><i>Surely <u>now</u> people will stop with this <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/marc-benioff-national-guard-marvin-lewis-21097185.php">"good billionaire"</a> bullshit.

[...] <p>For the record: I think Jay Graber is a transphobe; I think there\'s just too much evidence in her behavior to not read that into her actions at this point. No normal person would go out of their way to court Jesse Singal. A lot of this stuff feels motivated by a glaring animus towards the userbase that Bluesky has attracted; and because this userbase formed around people who simply couldn\'t justify being on Twitter any more, said userbase is full of highly visible trans users. <p>But, we can also view it as just run of the mill stuff for any kind of corporate social media platform; you expect them to be unaccountable, to have vague policies that are enforced with no consistency, and so on. What distinguishes the Bluesky case, though, is that Bluesky has a very particular ideology that Graber and her cohorts push, which is that they are \'stewards of the AT Protocol\'. She has repeatedly made this point: you can take your ball and go home. <p>Graber posts something like this basically every other day. So, let\'s examine her claim a little bit. [...] <p>ATProto\'s complicated architecture more or less puts running an alternative app into the realm of well-funded nonprofits and startups, as opposed to Mastodon instances which can easily be run by hobbyists on their own domestic hardware. [...] <p>AT Proto decentralization doesn\'t exist as a practical reality, and if it ever does it won\'t be for years. Most of the work driving effective decentralization is being done by third parties, who have limited guarantees about future compatibility with possible breaking changes on Bluesky\'s end. <p>Bluesky inc isn\'t really making \'a protocol\', they\'re making Bluesky, the monolithic (to within a rounding error) social network that they operate. [...] at this point, AT Proto has become essentially a sort of ideological vaporware; a way for Jay Graber et al to run a social media platform while claiming they don\'t run a social media platform. [...] <p>As it stands, for users using Bluesky\'s app view -- which is to say nearly everybody -- alternate moderation services can only ever be <i>additive</i>. Which is to say, you can never see posts that Bluesky doesn\'t want you to see, but you\'re free to ban more posts or users beyond what Bluesky will ban. This system means that Bluesky inc retains the power to use their effective monopoly to suppress speech Graber finds distasteful or ban porn that the moderators think is gross. <p>But at the same time they can hide behind these third-party \'labelers\' as an excuse when called out on their neglect in dealing with figures like Singal, a serial harasser and all-around scumbag.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2025/01/i-prefer-to-meet-people-where-they-are-says-reasonable-sounding-white-dude-holding-court-at-a-table-in-the-back-of-a-nazi-bar-redux/">Previously</a>, <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/11/i-prefer-to-meet-people-where-they-are-says-reasonable-sounding-white-dude-holding-court-at-a-table-in-the-back-of-a-nazi-bar/">previously</a>, <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/10/bluesky-now-owned-by-crypto-grifters/">previously</a>, <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/05/blockchain-rasputin-over-here-is-mad-that-moderation-exists/">previously</a>, <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2025/09/worst-kirk/">previously</a>.'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://cdn.jwz.org/blog/2025/10/delusions-of-a-protocol/feed/', 'slash_comments': '11'}

Well, it might be if you selected the "<i>Portuguese</i>" option at the start but since\n  there\'s an "<i>English</i>" option and I have no interest in practicing my\n  non-existent Portuguese, that\'s what I picked.\n<p></p><p>While I\'m on the subject, I might as well deal with the translation up front.\n  It\'s not great. It\'s not terrible but it\'s a long way from idiomatic and has\n  some fairly unmistakeable errors. I was particularly confused by the way the\n  player-character is consistently shown as "<i>Detetive</i>" in dialog scenes\n  although when any of the other characters refer to him they use the word\n  "<i>Detective</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I wondered for a while if Detetive was actually his name and it was some kind of post-modernist joke but I\n  checked and "<i>detetive</i>" is indeed Portuguese for "<i>detective</i>", so\n  I\'m guessing it\'s just an error. Translation is clearly still a work in\n  progress anyway. Whole passages of dialog are still in Portuguese in the\n  supposedly English version.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s all perfectly understandable (Well, the translated bits. The untranslated Portuguese maybe not so much...) so it didn\'t get in the way of the game for me.\n  Not that there <i>is </i>much of a game in the demo. The <i>Steam </i>Store page doesn\'t\n  really claim a genre for A Tale of Dirty Whiskers but I was expecting some\n  kind of adventure-murder-mystery-detection-point-and-click affair. Instead, I\n  think it might be more accurate to call it a Visual Novel because there\'s very\n  little for the player to do except turn the virtual pages.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It opens with a seven minute sequence that requires no input from the player\n  at all and the entire demo only took me tem more minutes to complete, during\n  which I did very little more. Mostly what I did was watch a bunch of\n  odd-looking but nicely-drawn cat-people insult me and make snarky remarks about each other.

I\'ve always thought spoken Portuguese sounds very little like\n  Spanish, unlike written Portuguese, which looks very much like Spanish indeed.\n  I\'m kinda surprised I mistook one for the other, even in the short clip I\n  watched.

Well, it might be if you selected the "<i>Portuguese</i>" option at the start but since\n  there\'s an "<i>English</i>" option and I have no interest in practicing my\n  non-existent Portuguese, that\'s what I picked.\n<p></p><p>While I\'m on the subject, I might as well deal with the translation up front.\n  It\'s not great. It\'s not terrible but it\'s a long way from idiomatic and has\n  some fairly unmistakeable errors. I was particularly confused by the way the\n  player-character is consistently shown as "<i>Detetive</i>" in dialog scenes\n  although when any of the other characters refer to him they use the word\n  "<i>Detective</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I wondered for a while if Detetive was actually his name and it was some kind of post-modernist joke but I\n  checked and "<i>detetive</i>" is indeed Portuguese for "<i>detective</i>", so\n  I\'m guessing it\'s just an error. Translation is clearly still a work in\n  progress anyway. Whole passages of dialog are still in Portuguese in the\n  supposedly English version.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s all perfectly understandable (Well, the translated bits. The untranslated Portuguese maybe not so much...) so it didn\'t get in the way of the game for me.\n  Not that there <i>is </i>much of a game in the demo. The <i>Steam </i>Store page doesn\'t\n  really claim a genre for A Tale of Dirty Whiskers but I was expecting some\n  kind of adventure-murder-mystery-detection-point-and-click affair. Instead, I\n  think it might be more accurate to call it a Visual Novel because there\'s very\n  little for the player to do except turn the virtual pages.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It opens with a seven minute sequence that requires no input from the player\n  at all and the entire demo only took me tem more minutes to complete, during\n  which I did very little more. Mostly what I did was watch a bunch of\n  odd-looking but nicely-drawn cat-people insult me and make snarky remarks about each other.

There are no surprises here.&nbsp;<i>Dark Rites of Arkham</i>&nbsp;is exactly what it says it\'s going to be.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3566870/The_Dark_Rites_of_Arkham/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The store page on <i>Steam</i></span></a>, somewhat surprisingly, doesn\'t offer a neat one-line description I can\n  cut-and-paste here, opting instead for a full feature list, but I can tell you\n  it\'s a retro-noir, pixel graphic point and click adventure set in 1930s\n  Arkham, New York against a backdrop of Lovecraftian horror. The protagonist is\n  a hard-boiled detective and the crime he\'s investigating is a ritual murder.\n  With that, everyone knows where they are and what to expect and the demo\n  carries through on every one of those expectations.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Honestly, I could pretty much stop there. If you\'ve ever played one of these\n  games, all you\'ll need to know is that this is another of them. I\'ll say up\n  front that it\'s a good one, too. If you like this sort of thing, this is the\n  sort of thing you like. And if it isn\'t, it\'s not going to change your mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I suppose I should go into it all in a bit more detail, all the same. Wouldn\'t\n  be much of a review otherwise. Or much of a blog post.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Let me begin with the graphics, then. They\'re excellent, as I think you\'ll be\n  able to see from the screenshots. Over the last few years I have completely\n  changed my opinion on retro pixel graphics. I used to dislike it&nbsp;but now\n  I\'m quite fond of it. I\'m sure if you dig hard enough through my posts here,\n  you\'d be able to find more than one negative comment regarding the style but I\n  think you\'d have to go back quite a long way.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Like a lot of things, I think it\'s an acquired taste. Most people who\n  appreciate it now acquired their taste for it in their childhood. I didn\'t.\n  There were no pixels when I was a child.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7E_Po7vdokk7Tydv3tDXmYMSTfw6OjlMBG-Z5OHZV9vOjn-rsTeze5b9jqXSP19HhZNzBX8WVo2lTUJXDfj9CdVijcqkzEWBgoeWgojRWe9EBBnvnRpxZcbdIo1JOjvrRFUXs0PmVNXFy7rCY5ElN2IDg7VvuC4W3h2B2pkXtlhrp0gqqklXx_hgf5Po/s1920/droa3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7E_Po7vdokk7Tydv3tDXmYMSTfw6OjlMBG-Z5OHZV9vOjn-rsTeze5b9jqXSP19HhZNzBX8WVo2lTUJXDfj9CdVijcqkzEWBgoeWgojRWe9EBBnvnRpxZcbdIo1JOjvrRFUXs0PmVNXFy7rCY5ElN2IDg7VvuC4W3h2B2pkXtlhrp0gqqklXx_hgf5Po/w640-h360/droa3.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  By the time I saw graphics like these, I was already middle-aged. I didn\'t\n  like them then and I don\'t much like those old, original versions now. That\'s\n  why, for a while, I thought I didn\'t like the modern take on the style,\n  either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Retro pixel graphics, though, don\'t really look that much like the ones I\n  remember from thirty years ago. They\'re much more nuanced and subtle and there\n  always seems to be a wealth of detail I can\'t remember noticing when the\n  originals were around. I suspect that has far more to do with the graphic\n  capabilities of the machines I play them on now, and especially the monitors,\n  than anything about the art itself. I would have been playing the old pixel\n  adventure games on a 14" CRT display at 640x480. It\'s no wonder I could hardly\n  tell what I was looking at, half the time.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So,<i> DRoA</i> looks good. That\'s a start. How does it read? After all,\n  reading the words is every bit as important as looking at the pictures in a\n  point and click adventure.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It is all reading, too.

There are no surprises here.&nbsp;<i>Dark Rites of Arkham</i>&nbsp;is exactly what it says it\'s going to be.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3566870/The_Dark_Rites_of_Arkham/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The store page on <i>Steam</i></span></a>, somewhat surprisingly, doesn\'t offer a neat one-line description I can\n  cut-and-paste here, opting instead for a full feature list, but I can tell you\n  it\'s a retro-noir, pixel graphic point and click adventure set in 1930s\n  Arkham, New York against a backdrop of Lovecraftian horror. The protagonist is\n  a hard-boiled detective and the crime he\'s investigating is a ritual murder.\n  With that, everyone knows where they are and what to expect and the demo\n  carries through on every one of those expectations.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Honestly, I could pretty much stop there. If you\'ve ever played one of these\n  games, all you\'ll need to know is that this is another of them. I\'ll say up\n  front that it\'s a good one, too. If you like this sort of thing, this is the\n  sort of thing you like. And if it isn\'t, it\'s not going to change your mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I suppose I should go into it all in a bit more detail, all the same. Wouldn\'t\n  be much of a review otherwise. Or much of a blog post.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Let me begin with the graphics, then. They\'re excellent, as I think you\'ll be\n  able to see from the screenshots. Over the last few years I have completely\n  changed my opinion on retro pixel graphics. I used to dislike it&nbsp;but now\n  I\'m quite fond of it. I\'m sure if you dig hard enough through my posts here,\n  you\'d be able to find more than one negative comment regarding the style but I\n  think you\'d have to go back quite a long way.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Like a lot of things, I think it\'s an acquired taste. Most people who\n  appreciate it now acquired their taste for it in their childhood. I didn\'t.\n  There were no pixels when I was a child.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7E_Po7vdokk7Tydv3tDXmYMSTfw6OjlMBG-Z5OHZV9vOjn-rsTeze5b9jqXSP19HhZNzBX8WVo2lTUJXDfj9CdVijcqkzEWBgoeWgojRWe9EBBnvnRpxZcbdIo1JOjvrRFUXs0PmVNXFy7rCY5ElN2IDg7VvuC4W3h2B2pkXtlhrp0gqqklXx_hgf5Po/s1920/droa3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7E_Po7vdokk7Tydv3tDXmYMSTfw6OjlMBG-Z5OHZV9vOjn-rsTeze5b9jqXSP19HhZNzBX8WVo2lTUJXDfj9CdVijcqkzEWBgoeWgojRWe9EBBnvnRpxZcbdIo1JOjvrRFUXs0PmVNXFy7rCY5ElN2IDg7VvuC4W3h2B2pkXtlhrp0gqqklXx_hgf5Po/w640-h360/droa3.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  By the time I saw graphics like these, I was already middle-aged. I didn\'t\n  like them then and I don\'t much like those old, original versions now. That\'s\n  why, for a while, I thought I didn\'t like the modern take on the style,\n  either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Retro pixel graphics, though, don\'t really look that much like the ones I\n  remember from thirty years ago. They\'re much more nuanced and subtle and there\n  always seems to be a wealth of detail I can\'t remember noticing when the\n  originals were around. I suspect that has far more to do with the graphic\n  capabilities of the machines I play them on now, and especially the monitors,\n  than anything about the art itself. I would have been playing the old pixel\n  adventure games on a 14" CRT display at 640x480. It\'s no wonder I could hardly\n  tell what I was looking at, half the time.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So,<i> DRoA</i> looks good. That\'s a start. How does it read? After all,\n  reading the words is every bit as important as looking at the pictures in a\n  point and click adventure.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It is all reading, too. There\'s no voice acting, just a rather pleasant period\n  jazz soundtrack. The text, which displays quickly and legibly across the\n  screen, reads very well.

At that point, I\'d played for just under an\nhour. My played time on <i>Steam </i>now stands at 96 minutes but that extra half an\nhour or so has made a big difference to what I would have said about it. I\nalready liked it but having seen more, I&nbsp;<i>really</i> like it!\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Often I find demos that have been specifically created <i>as </i>demos give a\n  better indication of what the full game will be like than than those that just\n  give you the the opening chapter or two but this does appear to be the largely unedited opening of the game. If so, it works extremely well.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The demo opens with a disturbing black and white sequence in which the main\n  character, <i>Amelia</i>, is being interrogated by a bunch of shadowy figures, whose faces can\'t be seen. She\'s clearly under investigation for something she\'s done and they\'re looking for her to give a frank and full account of whatever it is that just happened.</p><p>\n  From there, the game moves into flashback, narrated by Amelia, as she attempts to explain everything to their satisfaction. Her flashbacks are where the bulk of the game takes place. Intermittently as you play, the scene shifts\n  back to the interrogation and Amelia has to justify her actions or\n  elaborate on them to the satisfaction of her interrogators. That makes for an atmospheric and somewhat unsettling start but things are\n  only going to get worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Amelia recalls leaving her evening classes around\n  eight in the evening on Friday 8 December, 2079, intending to go home to her&nbsp;very\n  exclusive and expensive Paris apartment, which we later learn her mother\n  bought seven years ago, when Amelia started secondary school.

They own it and it\'s where she spent many a happy family\n  holiday in her childhood. At this point she\'s suspecting her mother may have\n  something to do with what\'s going on (You think?) but she\'s understandably still not at\n  all happy about it.\n<p></p>\n\n<p>\n  From then on the player has full control over Amelia\'s movements and actions, at least when she\'s not in the interrogation room. The game uses a nice three-quarter\n  angle I found very easy to get on with and although there\'s a\n  warning that it was designed with a controller in mind, I found it very\n  comfortable to play with the keyboard. The mouse isn\'t used at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once in the castle, gameplay comes in two parts: exploration and turn-based\n  combat. Only part of the building is available to explore in the demo but even that seems\n  like a lot. There are a number of rooms you can go in right away and more that open\n  after certain criteria are met. There\'s also a large outdoor area with formal\n  gardens and a courtyard and a small observatory. And there\'s a\n  dungeon, although in the demo it only seems to exist to give the androids a place to hang out and... drink?</p>\n<p>\n  To save a lot of exposition and explanation, what happens is that Amelia finds\n  she\'s been brought to the castle to play a game. A kind of LARP with androids. She acquires a tablet device\n  that allows her to print copies of soldiers to fight for her. The tablet also protects her from attacks. When it\n  fails, the fight ends but Amelia cannot be harmed. Or so people kept telling\n  her. I\'m not sure she or I believed it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All fights have to be initiated by Amelia. She\'s never attacked. They\'re all\n  set-piece battles, clearly framed as some kind of test within the framework of the game. Both the game Amelia is playing and the actual video game. It\'s clever.</p><p>Initially, fights are mostly trial and error. There\'s little information about the opponents or their abilities&nbsp; but as soon as you defeat one you learn its\n  strategies, which you can apply to other, similar enemies. Or you could work\n  it out from observation. In these early stages, at least, it\'s usually something simple like "<i>Always attacks the person farthest away</i>". I imagine things get more complicated later on.</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjueXQyDCYZVCLhITSbVUffjw4M_ysop2hBcT3tBinu0meKf6u5mSZK-fdX7HgSxBFZJg_BGAP0f9HUfvS_D8RKrVD2FWV7COaIOG6pE1nW100VtrfmatEta0IHZmrvYl3rIJ9cec6HJ8oOcjPhq8juDB-VBtHx4g2df78SVMNcZThjl0_A4Xh_XDDfom0/s1920/diss2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjueXQyDCYZVCLhITSbVUffjw4M_ysop2hBcT3tBinu0meKf6u5mSZK-fdX7HgSxBFZJg_BGAP0f9HUfvS_D8RKrVD2FWV7COaIOG6pE1nW100VtrfmatEta0IHZmrvYl3rIJ9cec6HJ8oOcjPhq8juDB-VBtHx4g2df78SVMNcZThjl0_A4Xh_XDDfom0/w640-h360/diss2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n  The game isn\'t a roguelike per se but you can re-fight each battle as often as\n  you want and you learn from each loss, so in a way it\'s similar. I\n  found the fights very much scratched my itch for thoughtful, tactical,\n  turn-based combat. They were fun. I didn\'t mind repeating them.<p></p><p>Then again, there weren\'t enough of them for it to become tedious. I only saw three but there was at least one more I saw the set-up for but didn\'t do.\n  Although the thrust of the "<i>game</i>" Amelia is playing involves those\n  fights, the game<i> I </i>was playing had far more to do with Amelia\' trying to work out what the hell was going on. And it\'s a fascinating scenario.</p>\n<p>\n  The "<i>soldiers</i>" are AI-controlled robots. Or they might be. Amelia is\n  familiar with AI and works with it in her studies. Also, her mother is deeply involved it commercially and professionally. But these are far more sophisticated units than\n  she\'s used to seeing. They\'re so convincing, she wonders if they might be being remotely controlled\n  by humans but the AIs say not and eventually she believes them.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They are also humanoid, which apparently is absolutely illegal in 2079. Amelia\n  suspects they may be some outlaw work of her mother\'s. It&nbsp; certainly explains why\n  she\'s being interrogated.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Dissimilar is one of those games that doesn\'t give you much in the way of\n  exposition, relying instead on supposition and internal narrative. Everything\n  you learn comes from Amelia\'s interior monologue and the increasingly probing\n  questions she asks the AIs, none of which is able to answer her directly on\n  anything but the game she\'s supposed to be playing but some of whom reveal more than they mean to anyway.</p>\n<p>\n  I loved all of that. It\'s exactly my kind of story-telling. Abstruse, veiled and elliptical. I found the\n  world-building fascinating and the plot intriguing, too. Couple all of that to some\n  gorgeous graphics and entertaining gameplay and you have a game that\'s going\n  straight onto my wish-list.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The best part wasn\'t any of that, though. It was the way it ended.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgA1cOInGeqXsVkkkx1-QMgAFm5JfONJZOnJsPtquVAVFUx04xMGGbBPaPPZESAjjRdszAoeVN3Lw7dlU7VnfU5FcasS8aoHTUKSR2uniGL-8MJAeZN7RO3jtK4IA1K-fo-qZzrNKeWmKkF_oJHM2xSBJU1fVkkQj2O8lLKghgaY-RZmW0N98SFghxAgAE/s1920/diss3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgA1cOInGeqXsVkkkx1-QMgAFm5JfONJZOnJsPtquVAVFUx04xMGGbBPaPPZESAjjRdszAoeVN3Lw7dlU7VnfU5FcasS8aoHTUKSR2uniGL-8MJAeZN7RO3jtK4IA1K-fo-qZzrNKeWmKkF_oJHM2xSBJU1fVkkQj2O8lLKghgaY-RZmW0N98SFghxAgAE/w640-h360/diss3.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>There is a "<i>normal</i>" end to\n  the demo, where you meet some hidden criterion and the game gives you a score,\n  tells you you\'re done and invites you to carry on anyway to see anything you\n  might have missed. I got that one. Then I carried on.<p></p>\n<p>\n  Much better was learning I could can win the game by not playing at all.\n  Well, not "<i>win</i>" so much as "<i>finish</i>". But it felt like a win all\n  the same.\n</p><p>When I play pre-defined characters in narrative-driven games, I often find\n  myself wishing the character I\'m playing would just say no sometimes. So many\n  of the situations they allow themselves to be put in seem like nothing I would\n  ever want to do and I wish <i>they\'d</i> just not allow it, either..&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s very rare for a game to let the player enact such a refusal, for the\n  obvious reason that to do so would completely negate the point of playing the game in the first place.\n  It isn\'t unheard of, all the same. I have seen it done a couple of times. I always take the\n  option if it\'s offered but it inevitably just leads to a snide "<i>Game Over</i>" card and either a re-start or me giving up on the game altogether (Which I\n  have also done because, like Amelia, I can be stubborn.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the Dissimilar demo, and presumably in the full game, Amelia gets into a\n  full-blown discussion with one of the AIs about what the hell is going on and\n  why she has to put up with any of it. I was cheering her on all the way when\n  she pushed the AI into admitting that, if she wanted to, she could just leave\n  the castle and that would count as having completed her "<i>quest</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I didn\'t think it would come up as an option for me to take on her behalf but it did. I was exploring\n  the grounds of the castle when I came to the main gates and saw they were\n  clickable. I clicked them and got the option either to stay or leave.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Obviously, I chose to leave. I was very curious to find out what would\n  happen.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1NdaKCjVmk2Hxr3mH7eTAilX8H6qHoUm8jvUCS_crpQklqRNLS03WyKE8oHuCR__G_1517oAQyW10Oh98ZPvGejO7Vo2MWpdb-_kppQPElI_W-JrlgDga3r63tmfa8xE801krskPWI-OypQ-2MnUDfqwdgjfM2utedeg3geiL9_3wNJ6Hrpy0CVyw8Zk/s1112/diss4.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1NdaKCjVmk2Hxr3mH7eTAilX8H6qHoUm8jvUCS_crpQklqRNLS03WyKE8oHuCR__G_1517oAQyW10Oh98ZPvGejO7Vo2MWpdb-_kppQPElI_W-JrlgDga3r63tmfa8xE801krskPWI-OypQ-2MnUDfqwdgjfM2utedeg3geiL9_3wNJ6Hrpy0CVyw8Zk/w400-h388/diss4.jpg" width="400" /></a>\n</div>\nIt wasn\'t what the AI Barkeep had promised. He told Amelia that if she left, not\nonly would her quest be complete but he\'d answer all her questions, always\nassuming he knew the answers. I was hoping she\'d be able to go back in and hold him to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>She couldn\'t. Instead, Amelia found herself back in the interrogation room, where a somewhat\n  disgruntled interrogator questioned her on what happened after she went through the gates. She described how she\'d been manhandled by the waiting\n  police and bundled away, which neatly explains why she wasn\'t able to go back inside\n  for the answers to her many questions.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  She went on to wonder whether she had indeed left too soon and if she wouldn\'t\n  have been better off carrying on with the game. The interrogators harumphed a\n  bit, clearly wishing she had done exactly that, then told her they were done with her.&nbsp;</p><p>What happened to her after that was not revealed. Instead, the game ended with one of those Game Over cards I mentioned, only this time it\n  felt completely satisfying, not least because it came with a note saying the\n  game had thoughtfully saved itself when I made my decision to leave the\n  castle, so if I wanted, I could go back and see how things would have turned\n  out if I hadn\'t.\n</p><p>\n  I thought that was the perfect way for Amelia to have her cake and for me to\n  eat it. I felt she\'d absolutely exerted her right to self-determination and\n  behaved in a fully rational and intelligent manner as befitting a highly\n  intelligent,&nbsp;independent&nbsp;young woman, while I\'d made a clean and clear choice to express my own independence of\n  thought, refusing to allow the game to control me rather than the other way\n  around.&nbsp;</p><p>That I hadn\'t saved the game before doing it meant it was a final, irrevocable move, untainted by indecision or wavering, and yet I felt the developers had slipped a safety-net under me without my even\n  noticing, so I wouldn\'t later be able to regret my stubbornness and curse them\n  for allowing me to indulge it.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQSD4wxnLyyDVsJlZtGl4OJG8maCEkkvaNdtc9y2mIlGA3XBCeO6Bvhp8B5XsbFrjmNHC7nghJAWwqNv6xGiHdpmSlxgKaxpsLA-1eAVVpP4oheqYieMTfAzawgdojFXrpmZ39ckOps8N_Pxc9fSBcKo1XVHB06JbbJdii9MDnYWg7ItpL9DFk-S8x45Q/s1152/diss5.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="70" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQSD4wxnLyyDVsJlZtGl4OJG8maCEkkvaNdtc9y2mIlGA3XBCeO6Bvhp8B5XsbFrjmNHC7nghJAWwqNv6xGiHdpmSlxgKaxpsLA-1eAVVpP4oheqYieMTfAzawgdojFXrpmZ39ckOps8N_Pxc9fSBcKo1XVHB06JbbJdii9MDnYWg7ItpL9DFk-S8x45Q/w640-h70/diss5.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  All things considered, an exemplary piece of game design.

At that point, I\'d played for just under an\nhour. My played time on <i>Steam </i>now stands at 96 minutes but that extra half an\nhour or so has made a big difference to what I would have said about it. I\nalready liked it but having seen more, I&nbsp;<i>really</i> like it!\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Often I find demos that have been specifically created <i>as </i>demos give a\n  better indication of what the full game will be like than than those that just\n  give you the the opening chapter or two but this does appear to be the largely unedited opening of the game. If so, it works extremely well.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The demo opens with a disturbing black and white sequence in which the main\n  character, <i>Amelia</i>, is being interrogated by a bunch of shadowy figures, whose faces can\'t be seen. She\'s clearly under investigation for something she\'s done and they\'re looking for her to give a frank and full account of whatever it is that just happened.</p><p>\n  From there, the game moves into flashback, narrated by Amelia, as she attempts to explain everything to their satisfaction. Her flashbacks are where the bulk of the game takes place. Intermittently as you play, the scene shifts\n  back to the interrogation and Amelia has to justify her actions or\n  elaborate on them to the satisfaction of her interrogators. That makes for an atmospheric and somewhat unsettling start but things are\n  only going to get worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Amelia recalls leaving her evening classes around\n  eight in the evening on Friday 8 December, 2079, intending to go home to her&nbsp;very\n  exclusive and expensive Paris apartment, which we later learn her mother\n  bought seven years ago, when Amelia started secondary school. I\'m not\n  wholly up to speed with the French education system, even assuming it won\'t be\n  very different half a century from now, but I would guess that puts her in her very late teens or even her early twenties.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Amelia calls a self-driving car, one of her mother\'s. Amelia\'s family, we will\n  learn, is <i>very </i>rich. And very old. And very important. In the car, Amelia\n  calls her boyfriend and they have a long conversation about role-playing\n  games.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju0ejjVP_dKHy9Vf4lXKFtPmhsHUIvAlVtbFJOAx3E78n_abdWg9jJimFddtW4IrM1oNlakSUzbhBd5r_kfgFappslR4Pv90xXr3aPQMiW4alKT7bQxFqNjYeU4Fy8lkJ-cNx0NXyRiQR2xpkf-0SJHzQPDAjw1qeYvpXirHU7Y5Fb-kjm3xWDJ6G7JCY/s1920/disscar2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju0ejjVP_dKHy9Vf4lXKFtPmhsHUIvAlVtbFJOAx3E78n_abdWg9jJimFddtW4IrM1oNlakSUzbhBd5r_kfgFappslR4Pv90xXr3aPQMiW4alKT7bQxFqNjYeU4Fy8lkJ-cNx0NXyRiQR2xpkf-0SJHzQPDAjw1qeYvpXirHU7Y5Fb-kjm3xWDJ6G7JCY/w640-h360/disscar2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  This seemed quite unlikely and it gave me some mild\n  forebodings about how arch and fan-servicey the writing might get, all of which\n  turned out to be completely unfounded.

It\'s\n  her castle.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLp2PMjh5Y_-Qszk8uwDU-Fz3JoD23fZPjfH2aTVj853wdkmI3MdJNwBQvZl3wzeJOzOreNKRJ5lSzTLOwmxCfDz96wZdASrouxgZfB4ZlvfalTGm5njUE1V7Csywz5zS4ABcDfOSymI2VTD8jvbJwThBW2gYsHqHiO6yBa5d1pi2pbTWJX3jye7pemfU/s1920/diss1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLp2PMjh5Y_-Qszk8uwDU-Fz3JoD23fZPjfH2aTVj853wdkmI3MdJNwBQvZl3wzeJOzOreNKRJ5lSzTLOwmxCfDz96wZdASrouxgZfB4ZlvfalTGm5njUE1V7Csywz5zS4ABcDfOSymI2VTD8jvbJwThBW2gYsHqHiO6yBa5d1pi2pbTWJX3jye7pemfU/w640-h360/diss1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</p>Well, her family\'s. They own it and it\'s where she spent many a happy family\n  holiday in her childhood. At this point she\'s suspecting her mother may have\n  something to do with what\'s going on (You think?) but she\'s understandably still not at\n  all happy about it.\n<p></p>\n\n<p>\n  From then on the player has full control over Amelia\'s movements and actions, at least when she\'s not in the interrogation room. The game uses a nice three-quarter\n  angle I found very easy to get on with and although there\'s a\n  warning that it was designed with a controller in mind, I found it very\n  comfortable to play with the keyboard. The mouse isn\'t used at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once in the castle, gameplay comes in two parts: exploration and turn-based\n  combat. Only part of the building is available to explore in the demo but even that seems\n  like a lot. There are a number of rooms you can go in right away and more that open\n  after certain criteria are met. There\'s also a large outdoor area with formal\n  gardens and a courtyard and a small observatory. And there\'s a\n  dungeon, although in the demo it only seems to exist to give the androids a place to hang out and... drink?</p>\n<p>\n  To save a lot of exposition and explanation, what happens is that Amelia finds\n  she\'s been brought to the castle to play a game. A kind of LARP with androids. She acquires a tablet device\n  that allows her to print copies of soldiers to fight for her. The tablet also protects her from attacks. When it\n  fails, the fight ends but Amelia cannot be harmed. Or so people kept telling\n  her. I\'m not sure she or I believed it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All fights have to be initiated by Amelia. She\'s never attacked. They\'re all\n  set-piece battles, clearly framed as some kind of test within the framework of the game. Both the game Amelia is playing and the actual video game. It\'s clever.</p><p>Initially, fights are mostly trial and error. There\'s little information about the opponents or their abilities&nbsp; but as soon as you defeat one you learn its\n  strategies, which you can apply to other, similar enemies. Or you could work\n  it out from observation. In these early stages, at least, it\'s usually something simple like "<i>Always attacks the person farthest away</i>". I imagine things get more complicated later on.</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjueXQyDCYZVCLhITSbVUffjw4M_ysop2hBcT3tBinu0meKf6u5mSZK-fdX7HgSxBFZJg_BGAP0f9HUfvS_D8RKrVD2FWV7COaIOG6pE1nW100VtrfmatEta0IHZmrvYl3rIJ9cec6HJ8oOcjPhq8juDB-VBtHx4g2df78SVMNcZThjl0_A4Xh_XDDfom0/s1920/diss2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjueXQyDCYZVCLhITSbVUffjw4M_ysop2hBcT3tBinu0meKf6u5mSZK-fdX7HgSxBFZJg_BGAP0f9HUfvS_D8RKrVD2FWV7COaIOG6pE1nW100VtrfmatEta0IHZmrvYl3rIJ9cec6HJ8oOcjPhq8juDB-VBtHx4g2df78SVMNcZThjl0_A4Xh_XDDfom0/w640-h360/diss2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n  The game isn\'t a roguelike per se but you can re-fight each battle as often as\n  you want and you learn from each loss, so in a way it\'s similar. I\n  found the fights very much scratched my itch for thoughtful, tactical,\n  turn-based combat. They were fun. I didn\'t mind repeating them.<p></p><p>Then again, there weren\'t enough of them for it to become tedious. I only saw three but there was at least one more I saw the set-up for but didn\'t do.\n  Although the thrust of the "<i>game</i>" Amelia is playing involves those\n  fights, the game<i> I </i>was playing had far more to do with Amelia\' trying to work out what the hell was going on. And it\'s a fascinating scenario.</p>\n<p>\n  The "<i>soldiers</i>" are AI-controlled robots. Or they might be. Amelia is\n  familiar with AI and works with it in her studies. Also, her mother is deeply involved it commercially and professionally. But these are far more sophisticated units than\n  she\'s used to seeing. They\'re so convincing, she wonders if they might be being remotely controlled\n  by humans but the AIs say not and eventually she believes them.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They are also humanoid, which apparently is absolutely illegal in 2079. Amelia\n  suspects they may be some outlaw work of her mother\'s. It&nbsp; certainly explains why\n  she\'s being interrogated.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Dissimilar is one of those games that doesn\'t give you much in the way of\n  exposition, relying instead on supposition and internal narrative. Everything\n  you learn comes from Amelia\'s interior monologue and the increasingly probing\n  questions she asks the AIs, none of which is able to answer her directly on\n  anything but the game she\'s supposed to be playing but some of whom reveal more than they mean to anyway.</p>\n<p>\n  I loved all of that. It\'s exactly my kind of story-telling. Abstruse, veiled and elliptical. I found the\n  world-building fascinating and the plot intriguing, too. Couple all of that to some\n  gorgeous graphics and entertaining gameplay and you have a game that\'s going\n  straight onto my wish-list.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The best part wasn\'t any of that, though. It was the way it ended.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgA1cOInGeqXsVkkkx1-QMgAFm5JfONJZOnJsPtquVAVFUx04xMGGbBPaPPZESAjjRdszAoeVN3Lw7dlU7VnfU5FcasS8aoHTUKSR2uniGL-8MJAeZN7RO3jtK4IA1K-fo-qZzrNKeWmKkF_oJHM2xSBJU1fVkkQj2O8lLKghgaY-RZmW0N98SFghxAgAE/s1920/diss3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgA1cOInGeqXsVkkkx1-QMgAFm5JfONJZOnJsPtquVAVFUx04xMGGbBPaPPZESAjjRdszAoeVN3Lw7dlU7VnfU5FcasS8aoHTUKSR2uniGL-8MJAeZN7RO3jtK4IA1K-fo-qZzrNKeWmKkF_oJHM2xSBJU1fVkkQj2O8lLKghgaY-RZmW0N98SFghxAgAE/w640-h360/diss3.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>There is a "<i>normal</i>" end to\n  the demo, where you meet some hidden criterion and the game gives you a score,\n  tells you you\'re done and invites you to carry on anyway to see anything you\n  might have missed. I got that one. Then I carried on.<p></p>\n<p>\n  Much better was learning I could can win the game by not playing at all.\n  Well, not "<i>win</i>" so much as "<i>finish</i>". But it felt like a win all\n  the same.\n</p><p>When I play pre-defined characters in narrative-driven games, I often find\n  myself wishing the character I\'m playing would just say no sometimes. So many\n  of the situations they allow themselves to be put in seem like nothing I would\n  ever want to do and I wish <i>they\'d</i> just not allow it, either..&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s very rare for a game to let the player enact such a refusal, for the\n  obvious reason that to do so would completely negate the point of playing the game in the first place.\n  It isn\'t unheard of, all the same. I have seen it done a couple of times. I always take the\n  option if it\'s offered but it inevitably just leads to a snide "<i>Game Over</i>" card and either a re-start or me giving up on the game altogether (Which I\n  have also done because, like Amelia, I can be stubborn.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the Dissimilar demo, and presumably in the full game, Amelia gets into a\n  full-blown discussion with one of the AIs about what the hell is going on and\n  why she has to put up with any of it. I was cheering her on all the way when\n  she pushed the AI into admitting that, if she wanted to, she could just leave\n  the castle and that would count as having completed her "<i>quest</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I didn\'t think it would come up as an option for me to take on her behalf but it did. I was exploring\n  the grounds of the castle when I came to the main gates and saw they were\n  clickable. I clicked them and got the option either to stay or leave.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Obviously, I chose to leave. I was very curious to find out what would\n  happen.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1NdaKCjVmk2Hxr3mH7eTAilX8H6qHoUm8jvUCS_crpQklqRNLS03WyKE8oHuCR__G_1517oAQyW10Oh98ZPvGejO7Vo2MWpdb-_kppQPElI_W-JrlgDga3r63tmfa8xE801krskPWI-OypQ-2MnUDfqwdgjfM2utedeg3geiL9_3wNJ6Hrpy0CVyw8Zk/s1112/diss4.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1NdaKCjVmk2Hxr3mH7eTAilX8H6qHoUm8jvUCS_crpQklqRNLS03WyKE8oHuCR__G_1517oAQyW10Oh98ZPvGejO7Vo2MWpdb-_kppQPElI_W-JrlgDga3r63tmfa8xE801krskPWI-OypQ-2MnUDfqwdgjfM2utedeg3geiL9_3wNJ6Hrpy0CVyw8Zk/w400-h388/diss4.jpg" width="400" /></a>\n</div>\nIt wasn\'t what the AI Barkeep had promised. He told Amelia that if she left, not\nonly would her quest be complete but he\'d answer all her questions, always\nassuming he knew the answers. I was hoping she\'d be able to go back in and hold him to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>She couldn\'t. Instead, Amelia found herself back in the interrogation room, where a somewhat\n  disgruntled interrogator questioned her on what happened after she went through the gates. She described how she\'d been manhandled by the waiting\n  police and bundled away, which neatly explains why she wasn\'t able to go back inside\n  for the answers to her many questions.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  She went on to wonder whether she had indeed left too soon and if she wouldn\'t\n  have been better off carrying on with the game. The interrogators harumphed a\n  bit, clearly wishing she had done exactly that, then told her they were done with her.&nbsp;</p><p>What happened to her after that was not revealed. Instead, the game ended with one of those Game Over cards I mentioned, only this time it\n  felt completely satisfying, not least because it came with a note saying the\n  game had thoughtfully saved itself when I made my decision to leave the\n  castle, so if I wanted, I could go back and see how things would have turned\n  out if I hadn\'t.\n</p><p>\n  I thought that was the perfect way for Amelia to have her cake and for me to\n  eat it. I felt she\'d absolutely exerted her right to self-determination and\n  behaved in a fully rational and intelligent manner as befitting a highly\n  intelligent,&nbsp;independent&nbsp;young woman, while I\'d made a clean and clear choice to express my own independence of\n  thought, refusing to allow the game to control me rather than the other way\n  around.&nbsp;</p><p>That I hadn\'t saved the game before doing it meant it was a final, irrevocable move, untainted by indecision or wavering, and yet I felt the developers had slipped a safety-net under me without my even\n  noticing, so I wouldn\'t later be able to regret my stubbornness and curse them\n  for allowing me to indulge it.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQSD4wxnLyyDVsJlZtGl4OJG8maCEkkvaNdtc9y2mIlGA3XBCeO6Bvhp8B5XsbFrjmNHC7nghJAWwqNv6xGiHdpmSlxgKaxpsLA-1eAVVpP4oheqYieMTfAzawgdojFXrpmZ39ckOps8N_Pxc9fSBcKo1XVHB06JbbJdii9MDnYWg7ItpL9DFk-S8x45Q/s1152/diss5.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="70" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQSD4wxnLyyDVsJlZtGl4OJG8maCEkkvaNdtc9y2mIlGA3XBCeO6Bvhp8B5XsbFrjmNHC7nghJAWwqNv6xGiHdpmSlxgKaxpsLA-1eAVVpP4oheqYieMTfAzawgdojFXrpmZ39ckOps8N_Pxc9fSBcKo1XVHB06JbbJdii9MDnYWg7ItpL9DFk-S8x45Q/w640-h70/diss5.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  All things considered, an exemplary piece of game design.

Things went much faster than I was expecting, although not for the reason I might have wished. I didn\'t really get into it and spend a lot longer playing than I thought I would. Just the opposite, in fact, as we\'re about to find out.<p></p><p>Here are the four demos I\'ve played so far, in descending order by how long Steam tells me I spent playing each of them:</p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Dissimilar</span></i> - 59 minutes&nbsp;</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Nova Antarctica</span></i> - 31 minutes</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Atomic Age</span></i> - 23 minutes</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Magic World</span></i> - 5 minutes</b></p><p>Let me break those timings down a little.&nbsp;</p><p>I haven\'t finished playing the <i>Dissimilar </i>demo. I stopped at a convenient point because it was getting late. I was having a pretty good time with it and the only reason I haven\'t gone back to finish it is because I thought I ought to get some of the others out of the way first.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, I\'ve played the whole of the <i>Nova Antarctica</i> demo twice. It has a fifteen-minute lockout.</p><p>The <i>Atomic Ag</i>e demo might last any amount of time. I wouldn\'t know. I got stuck in the very first location and decided enough was enough.</p><p>And the <i>Magic World</i> demo turned out not to be a demo of the game at all.</p><p>Now the reviews. I\'ll take them in reverse order, saving the best for last.&nbsp;</p><p><i><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Magic World </b></span></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is a demo for a game that supposed to be an open world MMORPG. Maybe it will be, one day. I wouldn\'t put my money on it. Certainly no-one, not even the developers, are claiming its an MMORPG yet.</p><p>The first thing you see when you hit Play is this warning:</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjAWIDnuKmTgky8wgnrZCLlR9ojA_LI_xeUymUYl72sB6yr-nTXrKOLUO0iDUq2OWLX8Iwfx6dHEqVeHFhwLySW6-gXGwZskPEMnbgQUrfhwkeuz-iag-wx511GcAxknxbRixJY4m608q6UnpGHPJNwIjxpkY29IQGnPvteU5DpMAmWVDXWF_48njgoDk/s1241/mwdemo1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="244" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjAWIDnuKmTgky8wgnrZCLlR9ojA_LI_xeUymUYl72sB6yr-nTXrKOLUO0iDUq2OWLX8Iwfx6dHEqVeHFhwLySW6-gXGwZskPEMnbgQUrfhwkeuz-iag-wx511GcAxknxbRixJY4m608q6UnpGHPJNwIjxpkY29IQGnPvteU5DpMAmWVDXWF_48njgoDk/w640-h244/mwdemo1.png" width="640" /></a></div>At best, it\'s a tech demo, although even that\'s pushing it. It\'s a very basic draft of the proposed magic system as it relates to combat. There\'s a short tutorial, using placeholder graphics, in which you move through a series of featureless corridors and open spaces, following instructions on how to move your mouse and press keys to fire spells at an opponent or protect yourself from attacks. There are also options to duel other players and fight NPC opponents, neither of which I felt the slightest inclination to do.<p></p><p>Steam tells me it took five minutes to get to the end of the tutorial but it felt a lot longer than that. I never expected to enjoy the gimmick of moving my mouse while pressing a key in order to cast a spell but this was even less fun than I thought it would be. No fun at all, in fact.</p><p>I can easily imagine a VR game, where you have to wave a wand around to cast spells, being both exciting and immersive but this is neither. The idea of simulating somatic gestures by moving your mouse left and right or up and down seems doomed to failure form the start. Who would find that more enjoyable than any of many variations on action combat we have already?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhT0li4geRjg_nG3toOLCKQ__5JtqjXDrkKKOwRUwsSZQSWZ299zBgUEecths-cDYsVKUAlem4rzPid90pks8VtzEPq0kzqeGr03agOQdv8hyphenhyphenCRw7OtfUOrQi2tuTtH2yIzb-wosqbCZtJOC4VvyuPvgaldUsD2oN0Nrhr_nWd5RH7F8YbWEc28xHYJbo/s1920/mw3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhT0li4geRjg_nG3toOLCKQ__5JtqjXDrkKKOwRUwsSZQSWZ299zBgUEecths-cDYsVKUAlem4rzPid90pks8VtzEPq0kzqeGr03agOQdv8hyphenhyphenCRw7OtfUOrQi2tuTtH2yIzb-wosqbCZtJOC4VvyuPvgaldUsD2oN0Nrhr_nWd5RH7F8YbWEc28xHYJbo/w640-h360/mw3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Not me, that\'s for sure. As for the demo not including anything that makes the game an MMORPG, I think it\'s perfectly reasonable for the devs to put up a tech demo and ask for feedback. I just don\'t want to be the one playing it. Looking at the game\'s store page, it does explain that\'s what it is (Kind of...).

Those were all the usable items I could find apart from a gramophone and the door. Using the gramophone caused a drawer at the bottom to open and close and that was all. No item would interact with it, open or closed. Nothing would interact with the door. None of the items worked on or with each other.</p><p>I googled for a walkthrough but it seems no-one has bothered to write one. Or even complain about being stuck. At which point, I decided I had better things to do with my time and called it a day.</p><p>Apart from the unplayabilty of it all, I found the controls annoying. In most point&amp;click adventures, you <i>Examine </i>with RMB and <i>Use </i>with LMB. This one does the opposite. Either I or B usually opens your inventory. Here, neither does. I could only open it by clicking on the icon at the bottom left of the screen and once the inventory was open it obscured most of the middle of the picture, making it very awkward to hand anything to anyone or use an object in the backpack on anything in the room.</p><p>None of these idiosyncrasies presented an insurmountable problem but all put together they added up to a constant background of mild irritation. Compounded with the major frustration of being stuck in the first room, it was more than enough to make me want to quit, which I did.</p><p>I wouldn\'t write the game off for that, though. A walkthrough or even an in-game hint would have gotten me over the hump and the odd UI choices are something I\'d have become used to as I went along. The visuals are very appealing and the voice acting was more than decent. I\'ll give it another go if I find out how to get past the opening screen.&nbsp;</p><p><i><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Nova Antarctica</span></b></i></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMII3t0ivJAor2Er2BG_3aBLM5huPE-6lO8yzNSRwwb_jS-ZzzYH4j5Wx-_AB-_yWoBFwHOT2cFoDGhCj9XQkK_Dceh2fSuT3ryyo7UNoIlOVsz4ibCtcoT028fi4qFiHH_FqWpwavHbm73lDuEJbr2sguXwA-HAGmmACiCaUGWO5BaCt4dtJ3Wu53W40/s1920/narc1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMII3t0ivJAor2Er2BG_3aBLM5huPE-6lO8yzNSRwwb_jS-ZzzYH4j5Wx-_AB-_yWoBFwHOT2cFoDGhCj9XQkK_Dceh2fSuT3ryyo7UNoIlOVsz4ibCtcoT028fi4qFiHH_FqWpwavHbm73lDuEJbr2sguXwA-HAGmmACiCaUGWO5BaCt4dtJ3Wu53W40/w640-h360/narc1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />This demo felt much more polished, finished and complete than the other two. It ran flawlessly and everything was clearly explained. The game plays well and looks great.&nbsp;<p></p><p>I didn\'t enjoy it all that much, for two main reasons:</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>It\'s a true survival game</li><li>It\'s on a timer.</li></ol><p>Yes, I knew it was a survival game, going in. Yes, I have played quite a few survival games and enjoyed them. Even so, I wasn\'t ready for such a harsh, unforgiving experience.</p><p>At the start of the demo you arrive in the Antarctic by boat. According to the game\'s description, you\'re a child although, since the character is dressed in an all-over environment suit, complete with helmet, that looks exactly like a space-suit, you could be a gnome or a dwarf or anything less than four foot tall, it\'s impossible to tell.</p><p>The suit has a backpack life-support system powered by batteries. If the temperature drops below zero it uses power. (It\'s the Antarctic. It\'s <i>always </i>below zero.) If there\'s a blizzard, power use increases enormously (It\'s the Antarctic. There are <i>always </i>blizzards.)&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLrtDkoCSLoBlisQaP27V2-xIpNL_VdYtTgDexuEXoWU_4pTujIJ7sCMP5pSpOuvL8GVQpn_pc0LxB-D6H63Tbqi11U5sd1uvIuuztZ0jgJIiWVylgor8-49x9lpIaOvfh4rvjT8hekB-yc1t-2q2k3jXL27WCfKFnnfQ72uLtG6IF5YL-1evXtbO6A_o/s1920/narc2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLrtDkoCSLoBlisQaP27V2-xIpNL_VdYtTgDexuEXoWU_4pTujIJ7sCMP5pSpOuvL8GVQpn_pc0LxB-D6H63Tbqi11U5sd1uvIuuztZ0jgJIiWVylgor8-49x9lpIaOvfh4rvjT8hekB-yc1t-2q2k3jXL27WCfKFnnfQ72uLtG6IF5YL-1evXtbO6A_o/w640-h360/narc2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>You follow some glowing footprints. You pick up everything you find - wood, rocks, meal packs, plant life - as you pass by the remnants of previous expeditions, including the corpses. You can even activate holograms that give you some idea what happened to them.</p><p>At various points the game instructs you on how to craft useful items from the detritus you\'ve found. A crate, so you can clamber over obstacles. A new battery to replace the one that\'s just about to run out. A pick to mine ore. You find a penguin you can pick up and carry to give you additional body heat.</p><p>All of which is quite good fun. Until you die. Which you will.</p><p>On my first run, I failed to replace my battery fast enough. I froze to death in a blizzard.

Andy Warhol would love it. (Actually, he\'d hate it but anyone over about fifty is culturally obliged to name-check the great man whenever the words "<i>fifteen minutes</i>" are mentioned, regardless of context.)</p><p>Fifteen minutes is not long enough for a demo in my opinion. I\'d say you need twice that long to get the feel of most games and probably longer for anything in the survival genre. I\'m sure, having played survival games before, that gameplay gets easier the longer you last, or at least the survival aspects will fade into the background. All this does is highlight the extreme difficulty of getting started in a game like this, which is the part most people would probably prefer to forget.</p><p>Also, similarly to Atomic Age, the controls were non-standard. Again, not a major problem. I was already adapting to them even in the short time I played. I do often wish there was an industry standard for these things that developers would adhere to, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn\'t be at all surprised if Nova Antarctica turns out to be a good game. I just don\'t think you can tell all that much about it from the demo. I wouldn\'t say it was a particularly good demo although it\'s not <i>bad </i>in any obvious way. Just not <i>good</i>.</p><p>And at this point I ought to move on to Dissimilar, only I think I\'ll save that for a separate post. This one\'s long enough and it would be unfair to hide the demo of the four I most enjoyed all the way down here. I might write it up later today or if not then tomorrow.</p><p>As for wish-listing, none of the three I\'ve talked about made it onto the list. Atomic Age might, one day, if I ever get to see the rest of the demo. Nova Antarctica just isn\'t for me. As for Magic World, I\'ll be surprised if it troubles any of us again.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhq9QeyLS21mHBu2NaJtMWGa-ivKtmD9y8gvGSrRv-AjTQ2kqoYXVF0U_wwjU9_vrlcYOnISVyqSw-OYyh2C-zztULFZ086qOJqSYL0sfkx6jS1PbAZkhbTbY2xZCw67RvjpU6qBiYDxkrxab6bX71Q1vkXSJAH41Y2yT7yvKdl3iRgR83U9WmTEwf140w/s1730/narc4.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhq9QeyLS21mHBu2NaJtMWGa-ivKtmD9y8gvGSrRv-AjTQ2kqoYXVF0U_wwjU9_vrlcYOnISVyqSw-OYyh2C-zztULFZ086qOJqSYL0sfkx6jS1PbAZkhbTbY2xZCw67RvjpU6qBiYDxkrxab6bX71Q1vkXSJAH41Y2yT7yvKdl3iRgR83U9WmTEwf140w/w640-h328/narc4.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />To my considerable surprise, I\'ve already played four of the eight demos I downloaded for <i>Next Fest</i>. Things went much faster than I was expecting, although not for the reason I might have wished. I didn\'t really get into it and spend a lot longer playing than I thought I would. Just the opposite, in fact, as we\'re about to find out.<p></p><p>Here are the four demos I\'ve played so far, in descending order by how long Steam tells me I spent playing each of them:</p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Dissimilar</span></i> - 59 minutes&nbsp;</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Nova Antarctica</span></i> - 31 minutes</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Atomic Age</span></i> - 23 minutes</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Magic World</span></i> - 5 minutes</b></p><p>Let me break those timings down a little.&nbsp;</p><p>I haven\'t finished playing the <i>Dissimilar </i>demo. I stopped at a convenient point because it was getting late. I was having a pretty good time with it and the only reason I haven\'t gone back to finish it is because I thought I ought to get some of the others out of the way first.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, I\'ve played the whole of the <i>Nova Antarctica</i> demo twice. It has a fifteen-minute lockout.</p><p>The <i>Atomic Ag</i>e demo might last any amount of time. I wouldn\'t know. I got stuck in the very first location and decided enough was enough.</p><p>And the <i>Magic World</i> demo turned out not to be a demo of the game at all.</p><p>Now the reviews. I\'ll take them in reverse order, saving the best for last.&nbsp;</p><p><i><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Magic World </b></span></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is a demo for a game that supposed to be an open world MMORPG. Maybe it will be, one day. I wouldn\'t put my money on it. Certainly no-one, not even the developers, are claiming its an MMORPG yet.</p><p>The first thing you see when you hit Play is this warning:</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjAWIDnuKmTgky8wgnrZCLlR9ojA_LI_xeUymUYl72sB6yr-nTXrKOLUO0iDUq2OWLX8Iwfx6dHEqVeHFhwLySW6-gXGwZskPEMnbgQUrfhwkeuz-iag-wx511GcAxknxbRixJY4m608q6UnpGHPJNwIjxpkY29IQGnPvteU5DpMAmWVDXWF_48njgoDk/s1241/mwdemo1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="244" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjAWIDnuKmTgky8wgnrZCLlR9ojA_LI_xeUymUYl72sB6yr-nTXrKOLUO0iDUq2OWLX8Iwfx6dHEqVeHFhwLySW6-gXGwZskPEMnbgQUrfhwkeuz-iag-wx511GcAxknxbRixJY4m608q6UnpGHPJNwIjxpkY29IQGnPvteU5DpMAmWVDXWF_48njgoDk/w640-h244/mwdemo1.png" width="640" /></a></div>At best, it\'s a tech demo, although even that\'s pushing it. It\'s a very basic draft of the proposed magic system as it relates to combat. There\'s a short tutorial, using placeholder graphics, in which you move through a series of featureless corridors and open spaces, following instructions on how to move your mouse and press keys to fire spells at an opponent or protect yourself from attacks. There are also options to duel other players and fight NPC opponents, neither of which I felt the slightest inclination to do.<p></p><p>Steam tells me it took five minutes to get to the end of the tutorial but it felt a lot longer than that. I never expected to enjoy the gimmick of moving my mouse while pressing a key in order to cast a spell but this was even less fun than I thought it would be. No fun at all, in fact.</p><p>I can easily imagine a VR game, where you have to wave a wand around to cast spells, being both exciting and immersive but this is neither. The idea of simulating somatic gestures by moving your mouse left and right or up and down seems doomed to failure form the start. Who would find that more enjoyable than any of many variations on action combat we have already?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhT0li4geRjg_nG3toOLCKQ__5JtqjXDrkKKOwRUwsSZQSWZ299zBgUEecths-cDYsVKUAlem4rzPid90pks8VtzEPq0kzqeGr03agOQdv8hyphenhyphenCRw7OtfUOrQi2tuTtH2yIzb-wosqbCZtJOC4VvyuPvgaldUsD2oN0Nrhr_nWd5RH7F8YbWEc28xHYJbo/s1920/mw3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhT0li4geRjg_nG3toOLCKQ__5JtqjXDrkKKOwRUwsSZQSWZ299zBgUEecths-cDYsVKUAlem4rzPid90pks8VtzEPq0kzqeGr03agOQdv8hyphenhyphenCRw7OtfUOrQi2tuTtH2yIzb-wosqbCZtJOC4VvyuPvgaldUsD2oN0Nrhr_nWd5RH7F8YbWEc28xHYJbo/w640-h360/mw3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Not me, that\'s for sure. As for the demo not including anything that makes the game an MMORPG, I think it\'s perfectly reasonable for the devs to put up a tech demo and ask for feedback. I just don\'t want to be the one playing it. Looking at the game\'s store page, it does explain that\'s what it is (Kind of...). I didn\'t see that when I chose it and if I had I would never have downloaded it. I don\'t think it was made clear in the Next Fest entry but I might just have missed it.</p><p>Also, to answer a question that came up in the comments last time, the store page clarifies that the images they\'re currently using to promote it <i>are </i>indeed generated by AI but they promise no AI content will be used in the game itself.

No item would interact with it, open or closed. Nothing would interact with the door. None of the items worked on or with each other.</p><p>I googled for a walkthrough but it seems no-one has bothered to write one. Or even complain about being stuck. At which point, I decided I had better things to do with my time and called it a day.</p><p>Apart from the unplayabilty of it all, I found the controls annoying. In most point&amp;click adventures, you <i>Examine </i>with RMB and <i>Use </i>with LMB. This one does the opposite. Either I or B usually opens your inventory. Here, neither does. I could only open it by clicking on the icon at the bottom left of the screen and once the inventory was open it obscured most of the middle of the picture, making it very awkward to hand anything to anyone or use an object in the backpack on anything in the room.</p><p>None of these idiosyncrasies presented an insurmountable problem but all put together they added up to a constant background of mild irritation. Compounded with the major frustration of being stuck in the first room, it was more than enough to make me want to quit, which I did.</p><p>I wouldn\'t write the game off for that, though. A walkthrough or even an in-game hint would have gotten me over the hump and the odd UI choices are something I\'d have become used to as I went along. The visuals are very appealing and the voice acting was more than decent. I\'ll give it another go if I find out how to get past the opening screen.&nbsp;</p><p><i><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Nova Antarctica</span></b></i></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMII3t0ivJAor2Er2BG_3aBLM5huPE-6lO8yzNSRwwb_jS-ZzzYH4j5Wx-_AB-_yWoBFwHOT2cFoDGhCj9XQkK_Dceh2fSuT3ryyo7UNoIlOVsz4ibCtcoT028fi4qFiHH_FqWpwavHbm73lDuEJbr2sguXwA-HAGmmACiCaUGWO5BaCt4dtJ3Wu53W40/s1920/narc1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMII3t0ivJAor2Er2BG_3aBLM5huPE-6lO8yzNSRwwb_jS-ZzzYH4j5Wx-_AB-_yWoBFwHOT2cFoDGhCj9XQkK_Dceh2fSuT3ryyo7UNoIlOVsz4ibCtcoT028fi4qFiHH_FqWpwavHbm73lDuEJbr2sguXwA-HAGmmACiCaUGWO5BaCt4dtJ3Wu53W40/w640-h360/narc1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />This demo felt much more polished, finished and complete than the other two. It ran flawlessly and everything was clearly explained. The game plays well and looks great.&nbsp;<p></p><p>I didn\'t enjoy it all that much, for two main reasons:</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>It\'s a true survival game</li><li>It\'s on a timer.</li></ol><p>Yes, I knew it was a survival game, going in. Yes, I have played quite a few survival games and enjoyed them. Even so, I wasn\'t ready for such a harsh, unforgiving experience.</p><p>At the start of the demo you arrive in the Antarctic by boat. According to the game\'s description, you\'re a child although, since the character is dressed in an all-over environment suit, complete with helmet, that looks exactly like a space-suit, you could be a gnome or a dwarf or anything less than four foot tall, it\'s impossible to tell.</p><p>The suit has a backpack life-support system powered by batteries. If the temperature drops below zero it uses power. (It\'s the Antarctic. It\'s <i>always </i>below zero.) If there\'s a blizzard, power use increases enormously (It\'s the Antarctic. There are <i>always </i>blizzards.)&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLrtDkoCSLoBlisQaP27V2-xIpNL_VdYtTgDexuEXoWU_4pTujIJ7sCMP5pSpOuvL8GVQpn_pc0LxB-D6H63Tbqi11U5sd1uvIuuztZ0jgJIiWVylgor8-49x9lpIaOvfh4rvjT8hekB-yc1t-2q2k3jXL27WCfKFnnfQ72uLtG6IF5YL-1evXtbO6A_o/s1920/narc2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLrtDkoCSLoBlisQaP27V2-xIpNL_VdYtTgDexuEXoWU_4pTujIJ7sCMP5pSpOuvL8GVQpn_pc0LxB-D6H63Tbqi11U5sd1uvIuuztZ0jgJIiWVylgor8-49x9lpIaOvfh4rvjT8hekB-yc1t-2q2k3jXL27WCfKFnnfQ72uLtG6IF5YL-1evXtbO6A_o/w640-h360/narc2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>You follow some glowing footprints. You pick up everything you find - wood, rocks, meal packs, plant life - as you pass by the remnants of previous expeditions, including the corpses. You can even activate holograms that give you some idea what happened to them.</p><p>At various points the game instructs you on how to craft useful items from the detritus you\'ve found. A crate, so you can clamber over obstacles. A new battery to replace the one that\'s just about to run out. A pick to mine ore. You find a penguin you can pick up and carry to give you additional body heat.</p><p>All of which is quite good fun. Until you die. Which you will.</p><p>On my first run, I failed to replace my battery fast enough. I froze to death in a blizzard. I had learned quite a bit, though, and I was sure I could do better.</p><p>I was right. I did much better. I got a lot further, saw a lot more, managed to replace the battery several times. I was just at the point when the game was telling me I ought to be making some kind of shelter when I died. My battery hadn\'t run out this time (Although it was damn close.) The timer had.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7YPhyphenhyphenlLimo8idOMfXqgValzw2kyeHmB_5G38xUlQYtfPDK1iGvzHeBrR5MFHZglh_yXIhHZQ3zCVuKhYTovyfF0PGOgTdoFYOxz9sLsMK3qGRxuchoMywGWuC0rp_AwF4j9_XvfoABtnrJo25Xw70E0vGFbPR2_y8rVP-GzKgCfPK_-JCBFI-yl-rSKE/s1920/narc3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7YPhyphenhyphenlLimo8idOMfXqgValzw2kyeHmB_5G38xUlQYtfPDK1iGvzHeBrR5MFHZglh_yXIhHZQ3zCVuKhYTovyfF0PGOgTdoFYOxz9sLsMK3qGRxuchoMywGWuC0rp_AwF4j9_XvfoABtnrJo25Xw70E0vGFbPR2_y8rVP-GzKgCfPK_-JCBFI-yl-rSKE/w640-h360/narc3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>You get fifteen minutes. Andy Warhol would love it. (Actually, he\'d hate it but anyone over about fifty is culturally obliged to name-check the great man whenever the words "<i>fifteen minutes</i>" are mentioned, regardless of context.)</p><p>Fifteen minutes is not long enough for a demo in my opinion. I\'d say you need twice that long to get the feel of most games and probably longer for anything in the survival genre. I\'m sure, having played survival games before, that gameplay gets easier the longer you last, or at least the survival aspects will fade into the background. All this does is highlight the extreme difficulty of getting started in a game like this, which is the part most people would probably prefer to forget.</p><p>Also, similarly to Atomic Age, the controls were non-standard. Again, not a major problem. I was already adapting to them even in the short time I played. I do often wish there was an industry standard for these things that developers would adhere to, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn\'t be at all surprised if Nova Antarctica turns out to be a good game. I just don\'t think you can tell all that much about it from the demo. I wouldn\'t say it was a particularly good demo although it\'s not <i>bad </i>in any obvious way. Just not <i>good</i>.</p><p>And at this point I ought to move on to Dissimilar, only I think I\'ll save that for a separate post. This one\'s long enough and it would be unfair to hide the demo of the four I most enjoyed all the way down here. I might write it up later today or if not then tomorrow.</p><p>As for wish-listing, none of the three I\'ve talked about made it onto the list. Atomic Age might, one day, if I ever get to see the rest of the demo. Nova Antarctica just isn\'t for me. As for Magic World, I\'ll be surprised if it troubles any of us again.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/next-fest-halfway-up-stairs.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/next-fest-halfway-up-stairs.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhq9QeyLS21mHBu2NaJtMWGa-ivKtmD9y8gvGSrRv-AjTQ2kqoYXVF0U_wwjU9_vrlcYOnISVyqSw-OYyh2C-zztULFZ086qOJqSYL0sfkx6jS1PbAZkhbTbY2xZCw67RvjpU6qBiYDxkrxab6bX71Q1vkXSJAH41Y2yT7yvKdl3iRgR83U9WmTEwf140w/s72-w640-h328-c/narc4.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '2'}

I\'ve already played two of them. I was out of the house a lot longer than I expected today,\nthough, and now I don\'t think I have time.<p></p>\n<p>\n  Which is handy because I also wanted to say something about the new\n  <i>EverQuest II </i>expansion, pre-orders for which went up either yesterday\n  or today. I saw the PR push when I logged in this morning and it\'s\n  impressive.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I think I mentioned this a while back but Daybreak have really upped their\n  game, when it comes to marketing. Here\'s the "<i><a href="https://www.everquest2.com/rage-of-cthurath"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">landing page</span></a></i>" on the official website. Slick, isn\'t it? And modern. You could easily be\n  fooled into thinking it was for a game less than twenty years old.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s also surprisingly informative. Not only does it tell you everything\n  you need to know if you\'re thinking of buying the expansion, it has a good amount of\n  detail about what to expect when you start playing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The "<i>New Lands To Discover</i>" section contains individual entries for\n  five different zones:\n  <i>Yon Gorroth, Oggothl Sprawl, The Unknown, Gerion, Hold of D\'Lere</i> and\n  <i>Zon Zobboz</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Pardon me a moment while I put my teeth back in.&nbsp;</p><p>I find it\n  hard to believe we\'re getting five non-instanced overland zones so I imagine\n  at least two of those will be "<i>dungeons</i>", even if they are open to the\n  lowering, purple skies of <i>The Void</i>. There are two screenshots for each zone and they make the hellscape look\n  nowhere near as grim and repulsive as I feared. That was my biggest worry\n  going into the expansion - that it would mean a year of dour, ugly heavy metal album cover art, all clashing colors and nowhere to rest your eyes.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, the art team seem to have done a magnificent job (As usual.) of\n  making everything look better than it has any right to be. Some of it looks\n  almost pretty. This, for example:\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZYO1bm7_WG17p_U_pgrar6DGeFEY9nTdOpjZKtT55JoS-Qgx06PkjopSN9g5vV4_e3ofuBmVyI-K06eCvz7BhgyW0cWchuhSpN60cA_pceXPzwNqIFy3E8KthXwy_0AR6dv3wgNTAptcDgt3HHiDa4oSTjOC9p8VJHTjjht-BBnqTJudh4Jio_-WWSkw/s1920/eq2os1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZYO1bm7_WG17p_U_pgrar6DGeFEY9nTdOpjZKtT55JoS-Qgx06PkjopSN9g5vV4_e3ofuBmVyI-K06eCvz7BhgyW0cWchuhSpN60cA_pceXPzwNqIFy3E8KthXwy_0AR6dv3wgNTAptcDgt3HHiDa4oSTjOC9p8VJHTjjht-BBnqTJudh4Jio_-WWSkw/w640-h360/eq2os1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nThere <i>is </i>an awful lot of purple and red but it could have been a lot worse.\nThere\'s a video, too, and that looks... actually, it looks really good.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />You know how these promo videos for aging MMOs can sometimes seem a little embarrassing? Not this one. Even the animations don\'t look too archaic.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Granted, they seem to have chosen some of the least cluttered, most open areas\n  to showcase, giving the whole thing a feel of open space and minimalism that\n  most likely won\'t be how it feels in the game itself. But that\'s the Marketing Department\'s job, isn\'t it? To make things look, if not better than they\n  really are, then at least as good as they can be.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As well as all the visuals, there\'s a lot of text. I read all of\n  it and found it quite intriguing. At one point I couldn\'t help wondering if\n  there wasn\'t some satirical point being made although I couldn\'t quite pin\n  down what it might be. Having the main villain of the piece be called <i>The Consumer</i> surely has to mean <i>something</i>, doesn\'t it?</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s also a nice list of features included in the expansion, several of\n  which seem pretty significant and/or useful. Last time around we got a keyring for Petamorph wands, something I thought was exciting enough to write\n  <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/11/scars-of-destruction-key-feature.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a whole post</span></a>\n  about. In <i>Rage of Cthurath</i> we\'re getting another Keyring, this one for\n  Illusions and I\'m even more excited about that.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I use the Petamorph keyring all the time but only on one or two characters\n  because it collates the specific items that change the appearance of combat\n  pets and only a small number of classes can use&nbsp; those.\n  Everyone can use illusion items, though. All my characters have some in their\n  bags and more in their bank vaults.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi46-4HOflQbr5fzPZ7BBePa48gqfB82Vgb3GABlE-uXV5_FdUDwrrXuyKsy8hjLGzhoi6XC8xU5w3SmAFMBS5Xt8DQIfkj-Xo5b1gIZaY_MD0WZcixMUYJ3csC6oH_JBrXuJwhWViS7JC0DBH3LBolikz9WwRVag9kxpT5Lc8uySWCtBOOMqIopnMn-Xc/s1480/eq2aoctxt1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="282" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi46-4HOflQbr5fzPZ7BBePa48gqfB82Vgb3GABlE-uXV5_FdUDwrrXuyKsy8hjLGzhoi6XC8xU5w3SmAFMBS5Xt8DQIfkj-Xo5b1gIZaY_MD0WZcixMUYJ3csC6oH_JBrXuJwhWViS7JC0DBH3LBolikz9WwRVag9kxpT5Lc8uySWCtBOOMqIopnMn-Xc/w640-h282/eq2aoctxt1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nHaving them on a Keyring is going to free up a significant amount of bag space\nbut better yet it will also mean I <i>use </i>the damn things. I like illusions and <i>EQII </i>has some very good ones but I can never be\nbothered to ferret around in my bags looking for the items and then clicking them just to make a cosmetic\nchange. If they\'re all on a handy keyring I can access with one click of the\nUI, then I\'m far more likely to enjoy them in the way they were\nintended.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  A much more significant innovation for most people, albeit not for me, is\n  likely to be the new option to be in two guilds at once. That could be a potentially\n  game-changing move for some. I would have loved it, back in the days when I was\n  active in multiple guilds and had to choose which characters would sign up to which of them.</p>\n<p>\n  I remember what a big deal it was when <i>Guild Wars 2</i> launched with the\n  option to join up to five guilds at once. I did make good use of that over the time I was there. For a while I was in four active guilds, doing different activities with all of them.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s surprising how few games have followed\n  suit. <i>DBG </i>is calling this feature "<i>Guild Coalitions</i>" and as yet\n  there are no details on exactly how it\'s going to work but even that they\'re\n  playing around with the concept is a huge step in a good direction for the\n  game.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The third new feature, also very much unexplained in any real detail at this\n  stage, is something called "<i>Untold Heroic Dungeons</i>". It looks as if it\n  will be EQII\'s version of <i>WoW</i>\'s Mythic/Mythic + system (Not that I understand how that works, either.) although\n  there are other ways it could go. It\'s highly unlikely (By which I mean all\n  but impossible.) that it\'ll be of any practical concern to me but I await\n  further news of how it works with interest.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6fbfQed6VhlkE3Ue_yPKWyPGWg1wsogaLzgwlm-2_gzqb3Gao7HGpX9rP0LIhrhsUAOhrf5kJeQF4OxdkhjVCxu526ibGeYlB2kX8qFm_mfaOJVFXXgGQjhAKQcWVdFUMG47DQvBYV0GqmSaY1wNjmQ6t4NlMLq2EJ-GMhYty2owicNLhatTrlE22oR4/s1486/eq2rocfeat1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="352" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6fbfQed6VhlkE3Ue_yPKWyPGWg1wsogaLzgwlm-2_gzqb3Gao7HGpX9rP0LIhrhsUAOhrf5kJeQF4OxdkhjVCxu526ibGeYlB2kX8qFm_mfaOJVFXXgGQjhAKQcWVdFUMG47DQvBYV0GqmSaY1wNjmQ6t4NlMLq2EJ-GMhYty2owicNLhatTrlE22oR4/w640-h352/eq2rocfeat1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  And that won\'t be long coming. Along with pre-orders comes beta access, full\n  details of which, including rewards for participating and hitting certain\n  benchmarks as you test things like the Signature Questline or the dungeons and\n  Public Quests, are included in <a href="https://www.everquest2.com/news/eq2-roc-beta-and-preorder"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the forum post</span></a>.</p>\n<p>\n  Tempting though the rewards, which include familiars, mounts and illusions,\n  may be, I will not be setting foot in the beta, even though I certainly will be\n  placing my pre-order very soon. The phrase "<i>too much of a good thing</i>"\n  comes to mind although in what sense a buggy, unfinished version of something\n  you\'re going to be seeing for real in less than eight weeks counts as a "<i>good</i>&nbsp;<i>thing</i>" is a question always worth asking.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As well as all of the above, the expansion obviously includes all the usual\n  content - major questlines for both adventurers and crafters, new spells and\n  abilities, more levels and so on. In some expansions that\'s about all you get and honestly it\'s probably all you really need. This time, though, it looks like there\'ll be one or two\n  rather tasty extras.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The release date is "<i>December 2025</i>". There\'s a caveat of "<i>before December 31</i>" in the small print but experience suggests the final date will be\n  considerably closer to the start of the month than that. As for the price, the\n  Standard Edition, which is the one I always buy, is £25. Okay, actually £25.12\n  for some weird currency conversion reason. The dollar price is $34.99. There\n  are the usual <i>Expensive, Very Expensive</i> and\n  <i>Insanely Expensive</i> editions (Not the official titles, unfortunately.).

I\'ve already played two of them. I was out of the house a lot longer than I expected today,\nthough, and now I don\'t think I have time.<p></p>\n<p>\n  Which is handy because I also wanted to say something about the new\n  <i>EverQuest II </i>expansion, pre-orders for which went up either yesterday\n  or today. I saw the PR push when I logged in this morning and it\'s\n  impressive.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I think I mentioned this a while back but Daybreak have really upped their\n  game, when it comes to marketing. Here\'s the "<i><a href="https://www.everquest2.com/rage-of-cthurath"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">landing page</span></a></i>" on the official website. Slick, isn\'t it? And modern. You could easily be\n  fooled into thinking it was for a game less than twenty years old.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s also surprisingly informative. Not only does it tell you everything\n  you need to know if you\'re thinking of buying the expansion, it has a good amount of\n  detail about what to expect when you start playing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The "<i>New Lands To Discover</i>" section contains individual entries for\n  five different zones:\n  <i>Yon Gorroth, Oggothl Sprawl, The Unknown, Gerion, Hold of D\'Lere</i> and\n  <i>Zon Zobboz</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Pardon me a moment while I put my teeth back in.&nbsp;</p><p>I find it\n  hard to believe we\'re getting five non-instanced overland zones so I imagine\n  at least two of those will be "<i>dungeons</i>", even if they are open to the\n  lowering, purple skies of <i>The Void</i>. There are two screenshots for each zone and they make the hellscape look\n  nowhere near as grim and repulsive as I feared. That was my biggest worry\n  going into the expansion - that it would mean a year of dour, ugly heavy metal album cover art, all clashing colors and nowhere to rest your eyes.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, the art team seem to have done a magnificent job (As usual.) of\n  making everything look better than it has any right to be. Some of it looks\n  almost pretty. This, for example:\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZYO1bm7_WG17p_U_pgrar6DGeFEY9nTdOpjZKtT55JoS-Qgx06PkjopSN9g5vV4_e3ofuBmVyI-K06eCvz7BhgyW0cWchuhSpN60cA_pceXPzwNqIFy3E8KthXwy_0AR6dv3wgNTAptcDgt3HHiDa4oSTjOC9p8VJHTjjht-BBnqTJudh4Jio_-WWSkw/s1920/eq2os1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZYO1bm7_WG17p_U_pgrar6DGeFEY9nTdOpjZKtT55JoS-Qgx06PkjopSN9g5vV4_e3ofuBmVyI-K06eCvz7BhgyW0cWchuhSpN60cA_pceXPzwNqIFy3E8KthXwy_0AR6dv3wgNTAptcDgt3HHiDa4oSTjOC9p8VJHTjjht-BBnqTJudh4Jio_-WWSkw/w640-h360/eq2os1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nThere <i>is </i>an awful lot of purple and red but it could have been a lot worse.\nThere\'s a video, too, and that looks... actually, it looks really good.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />You know how these promo videos for aging MMOs can sometimes seem a little embarrassing? Not this one. Even the animations don\'t look too archaic.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Granted, they seem to have chosen some of the least cluttered, most open areas\n  to showcase, giving the whole thing a feel of open space and minimalism that\n  most likely won\'t be how it feels in the game itself. But that\'s the Marketing Department\'s job, isn\'t it? To make things look, if not better than they\n  really are, then at least as good as they can be.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As well as all the visuals, there\'s a lot of text. I read all of\n  it and found it quite intriguing. At one point I couldn\'t help wondering if\n  there wasn\'t some satirical point being made although I couldn\'t quite pin\n  down what it might be. Having the main villain of the piece be called <i>The Consumer</i> surely has to mean <i>something</i>, doesn\'t it?</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s also a nice list of features included in the expansion, several of\n  which seem pretty significant and/or useful. Last time around we got a keyring for Petamorph wands, something I thought was exciting enough to write\n  <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/11/scars-of-destruction-key-feature.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a whole post</span></a>\n  about. In <i>Rage of Cthurath</i> we\'re getting another Keyring, this one for\n  Illusions and I\'m even more excited about that.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I use the Petamorph keyring all the time but only on one or two characters\n  because it collates the specific items that change the appearance of combat\n  pets and only a small number of classes can use&nbsp; those.\n  Everyone can use illusion items, though. All my characters have some in their\n  bags and more in their bank vaults.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi46-4HOflQbr5fzPZ7BBePa48gqfB82Vgb3GABlE-uXV5_FdUDwrrXuyKsy8hjLGzhoi6XC8xU5w3SmAFMBS5Xt8DQIfkj-Xo5b1gIZaY_MD0WZcixMUYJ3csC6oH_JBrXuJwhWViS7JC0DBH3LBolikz9WwRVag9kxpT5Lc8uySWCtBOOMqIopnMn-Xc/s1480/eq2aoctxt1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="282" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi46-4HOflQbr5fzPZ7BBePa48gqfB82Vgb3GABlE-uXV5_FdUDwrrXuyKsy8hjLGzhoi6XC8xU5w3SmAFMBS5Xt8DQIfkj-Xo5b1gIZaY_MD0WZcixMUYJ3csC6oH_JBrXuJwhWViS7JC0DBH3LBolikz9WwRVag9kxpT5Lc8uySWCtBOOMqIopnMn-Xc/w640-h282/eq2aoctxt1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nHaving them on a Keyring is going to free up a significant amount of bag space\nbut better yet it will also mean I <i>use </i>the damn things. I like illusions and <i>EQII </i>has some very good ones but I can never be\nbothered to ferret around in my bags looking for the items and then clicking them just to make a cosmetic\nchange. If they\'re all on a handy keyring I can access with one click of the\nUI, then I\'m far more likely to enjoy them in the way they were\nintended.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  A much more significant innovation for most people, albeit not for me, is\n  likely to be the new option to be in two guilds at once. That could be a potentially\n  game-changing move for some. I would have loved it, back in the days when I was\n  active in multiple guilds and had to choose which characters would sign up to which of them.</p>\n<p>\n  I remember what a big deal it was when <i>Guild Wars 2</i> launched with the\n  option to join up to five guilds at once. I did make good use of that over the time I was there. For a while I was in four active guilds, doing different activities with all of them.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s surprising how few games have followed\n  suit. <i>DBG </i>is calling this feature "<i>Guild Coalitions</i>" and as yet\n  there are no details on exactly how it\'s going to work but even that they\'re\n  playing around with the concept is a huge step in a good direction for the\n  game.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The third new feature, also very much unexplained in any real detail at this\n  stage, is something called "<i>Untold Heroic Dungeons</i>". It looks as if it\n  will be EQII\'s version of <i>WoW</i>\'s Mythic/Mythic + system (Not that I understand how that works, either.) although\n  there are other ways it could go. It\'s highly unlikely (By which I mean all\n  but impossible.) that it\'ll be of any practical concern to me but I await\n  further news of how it works with interest.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6fbfQed6VhlkE3Ue_yPKWyPGWg1wsogaLzgwlm-2_gzqb3Gao7HGpX9rP0LIhrhsUAOhrf5kJeQF4OxdkhjVCxu526ibGeYlB2kX8qFm_mfaOJVFXXgGQjhAKQcWVdFUMG47DQvBYV0GqmSaY1wNjmQ6t4NlMLq2EJ-GMhYty2owicNLhatTrlE22oR4/s1486/eq2rocfeat1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="352" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6fbfQed6VhlkE3Ue_yPKWyPGWg1wsogaLzgwlm-2_gzqb3Gao7HGpX9rP0LIhrhsUAOhrf5kJeQF4OxdkhjVCxu526ibGeYlB2kX8qFm_mfaOJVFXXgGQjhAKQcWVdFUMG47DQvBYV0GqmSaY1wNjmQ6t4NlMLq2EJ-GMhYty2owicNLhatTrlE22oR4/w640-h352/eq2rocfeat1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  And that won\'t be long coming. Along with pre-orders comes beta access, full\n  details of which, including rewards for participating and hitting certain\n  benchmarks as you test things like the Signature Questline or the dungeons and\n  Public Quests, are included in <a href="https://www.everquest2.com/news/eq2-roc-beta-and-preorder"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the forum post</span></a>.</p>\n<p>\n  Tempting though the rewards, which include familiars, mounts and illusions,\n  may be, I will not be setting foot in the beta, even though I certainly will be\n  placing my pre-order very soon. The phrase "<i>too much of a good thing</i>"\n  comes to mind although in what sense a buggy, unfinished version of something\n  you\'re going to be seeing for real in less than eight weeks counts as a "<i>good</i>&nbsp;<i>thing</i>" is a question always worth asking.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As well as all of the above, the expansion obviously includes all the usual\n  content - major questlines for both adventurers and crafters, new spells and\n  abilities, more levels and so on. In some expansions that\'s about all you get and honestly it\'s probably all you really need. This time, though, it looks like there\'ll be one or two\n  rather tasty extras.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The release date is "<i>December 2025</i>". There\'s a caveat of "<i>before December 31</i>" in the small print but experience suggests the final date will be\n  considerably closer to the start of the month than that. As for the price, the\n  Standard Edition, which is the one I always buy, is £25. Okay, actually £25.12\n  for some weird currency conversion reason. The dollar price is $34.99. There\n  are the usual <i>Expensive, Very Expensive</i> and\n  <i>Insanely Expensive</i> editions (Not the official titles, unfortunately.).

With luck there\'ll\n  be something about that here tomorrow. I\'m not promising though.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/eqii-rage-of-cthurath-welcome-to-our.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/eqii-rage-of-cthurath-welcome-to-our.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh51JGxPTdNa1_3g-k8G2cOl35SbXvMDKkOsMYQI1NU8Nd6fSzuWsUwRpgeeopVQbatrbwiK2PQ9Zw4A6uoEgj_ymt93Sd3EFg0AQ32k8q9oOSe1FLEN-9Y4uD5iywe_k4eXJh7Nf8oXuQGbuef5RSv2hDYGkFZR237WThTtRvqvbF1TSd1Sx3EWRtLLTo/s72-w640-h360-c/eq2aoc1.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

All eight of them, which is\nprobably at least two too many for me to get through before the event ends.\nPossibly more.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  A week really isn\'t long enough for this, is it? I guess the idea is that you\n  approach it\n  <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/category/nextfest/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the way <i>Krikket </i>does</span></a>\n  and only play each demo for long enough to decide if you want to wishlist it\n  or not. That is the purpose of the whole affair, after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I can\'t help treating them all as small, self-contained games. Unless I\n  actively dislike them, I\'m going to do my best to play each demo through to the end. The lengths vary a lot but I\'d guess most take 45-60 minutes to complete,\n  with a few outliers being either much shorter or completely open-ended, with no\n  obvious end-point.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That makes it unrealistic for me to try and fit more than a half-dozen or so\n  into my weekly gaming schedule, unless I\'m prepared to drop something in their\n  favor. Some quarters, it\'s not much of a problem. There have been Next Fests\n  where I\'ve struggled to come up with six demos I\'m interested in playing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, though, I have to turn down a few that look quite interesting and it has\n  to be remembered that the total number of available demos in every event is\n  well into four figures. Even allowing for the fact that most of them are in\n  genres I have absolutely no interest in playing, the handful I pick can barely\n  be representative of anything.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except it kind of is, anyway, because I always gravitate towards a couple of\n  categories that never seem to have a huge number of demos available: MMORPGs\n  and traditional point&amp;click adventures. Sometimes I can hardly find any of\n  either. Eight would often be a quorum.</p>\n<p>Not this time! There were more of both than I could cope with and several look\n  really promising. Games that\n  looked like I\'d enjoy them were positively jumping out at me. I made my selections in a matter of minutes.&nbsp;It helped that the whole thing seemed to be laid out and presented more coherently than usual,\n  although that might just have been because several of the demos that caught my\n  eye were in the "<i>Recommended For You</i>" section. That hardly ever happens. Maybe the algorithm has improved.</p>\n<p>The eight I went for are:</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Nighthawks</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"></span></b>\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDmmjCLO7dI_xJpUn50EBBGokhbK-Oinerb9jJLLhPvfEGo5IzmDFxfc5IB9cACbxFP69TL1PMxoGRpRyS8Zfs04o8ZF9elttfUgx-N98uKhhggI0moZawnTN72aeXI7M1PJ15Y6boWV_gJCxV3QrxuL8LEwxes4369lKDHjUpC72RkfFke110hdljYak/s1248/nhk1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDmmjCLO7dI_xJpUn50EBBGokhbK-Oinerb9jJLLhPvfEGo5IzmDFxfc5IB9cACbxFP69TL1PMxoGRpRyS8Zfs04o8ZF9elttfUgx-N98uKhhggI0moZawnTN72aeXI7M1PJ15Y6boWV_gJCxV3QrxuL8LEwxes4369lKDHjUpC72RkfFke110hdljYak/w640-h358/nhk1.png" width="640" /></a></span></b>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  First in this list, first in every way. I\'ve had this on my wishlist since\n  January 2021 (!) and I\'d honestly given up hope of ever seeing it. And now here it\n  is. Or a demo, anyway. It\'s a <i>Wadjet Eye</i> title and almost certainly\n  their most ambitious to date. The pitch is "<i>...a deliciously twisted new take on vampire role-playing games as you take\n    over a failing nightclub on the wrong side of the tracks, and turn it into\n    your personal empire through seduction, intimidation, and careful use of\n    secret supernatural Gifts</i>" Might be a little too much on the management-sim side of things for me but\n  I have very high hopes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Nova Antarctica</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  A survival game set in Antarctica in the year 2900, where you play a child\n  who\'s been sent alone to the South Pole to investigate a mysterious signal.\n  Why a child?

Maybe because despite the bleak setting, the game\n  looks extremely cute and gameplay involves "<i>the mysterious animals of Antarctica.</i>" One of the screenshots shows the child-protagonist wearing a space-suit and riding a wolf.

The visuals did\n  contribute a lot to my choices as they always do but there\'s no point trying\n  to play a great-looking game in a genre for which you have no affinity, so\n  even the greatest pictures have to take second place to the gameplay. This\n  one\'s "<i>A futuristic, humorous, slapstick based point &amp; click adventure in the\n    shape of the 50th and 60th years.</i>" All of that sounds right up my street except maybe the slapstick. I do\n  really like the phrasing on "<i>50th and 60th years</i>", which I\n  <i>think </i>means the 1950s and \'60s. It does describe itself as "<i>retro and nostalgic</i>" (For the characters, that is, not the player, which is a clever conceit, if hard to parse.)\n  I have a feeling this one could be quite odd. I hope so.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Dark Rites of Arkham</span></b>\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Pretty much says it all in the title, doesn\'t it? And yes, it\'s exactly what\n  you\'d expect: a pixel art point&amp;click (They cutely call it a\n  "<i>pulp&amp;click</i>".) in which "<i>A macabre ritual murder puts Arkham PD detectives Jack Foster and Harvey\n    Whitman to the test. As the investigation progresses, they will unveil a\n    disturbing connection between the Salem witch trials of the 17th century and\n    the end of humankind</i>." I\'m not a huge fan of Lovecraftiana but it\'s a safe and trusted setting\n  for this sort of thing and I\'m happy to give it a whirl.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Magic World</span></b><br />\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiioEtvMo811Ii-QSP1AiN5T7JtPwGcl6UL1ISmaPyX6rd8abqCY3_gFlP2TgQ6N45sm-iIz9cVfJXR5XQrO7xJd4Kg9x3P1kuaIkv7kiT5hcdXANQbEbDGBRE3JY49jY-RfQc1hDLOGIJwa02hWSlje58iAd3TlFKQaV6oiIrmtII9hT0wfiLR-pUMS1o/s1240/mw2.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiioEtvMo811Ii-QSP1AiN5T7JtPwGcl6UL1ISmaPyX6rd8abqCY3_gFlP2TgQ6N45sm-iIz9cVfJXR5XQrO7xJd4Kg9x3P1kuaIkv7kiT5hcdXANQbEbDGBRE3JY49jY-RfQc1hDLOGIJwa02hWSlje58iAd3TlFKQaV6oiIrmtII9hT0wfiLR-pUMS1o/w640-h358/mw2.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  An MMORPG.

All eight of them, which is\nprobably at least two too many for me to get through before the event ends.\nPossibly more.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  A week really isn\'t long enough for this, is it? I guess the idea is that you\n  approach it\n  <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/category/nextfest/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the way <i>Krikket </i>does</span></a>\n  and only play each demo for long enough to decide if you want to wishlist it\n  or not. That is the purpose of the whole affair, after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I can\'t help treating them all as small, self-contained games. Unless I\n  actively dislike them, I\'m going to do my best to play each demo through to the end. The lengths vary a lot but I\'d guess most take 45-60 minutes to complete,\n  with a few outliers being either much shorter or completely open-ended, with no\n  obvious end-point.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That makes it unrealistic for me to try and fit more than a half-dozen or so\n  into my weekly gaming schedule, unless I\'m prepared to drop something in their\n  favor. Some quarters, it\'s not much of a problem. There have been Next Fests\n  where I\'ve struggled to come up with six demos I\'m interested in playing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, though, I have to turn down a few that look quite interesting and it has\n  to be remembered that the total number of available demos in every event is\n  well into four figures. Even allowing for the fact that most of them are in\n  genres I have absolutely no interest in playing, the handful I pick can barely\n  be representative of anything.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except it kind of is, anyway, because I always gravitate towards a couple of\n  categories that never seem to have a huge number of demos available: MMORPGs\n  and traditional point&amp;click adventures. Sometimes I can hardly find any of\n  either. Eight would often be a quorum.</p>\n<p>Not this time! There were more of both than I could cope with and several look\n  really promising. Games that\n  looked like I\'d enjoy them were positively jumping out at me. I made my selections in a matter of minutes.&nbsp;It helped that the whole thing seemed to be laid out and presented more coherently than usual,\n  although that might just have been because several of the demos that caught my\n  eye were in the "<i>Recommended For You</i>" section. That hardly ever happens. Maybe the algorithm has improved.</p>\n<p>The eight I went for are:</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Nighthawks</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"></span></b>\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDmmjCLO7dI_xJpUn50EBBGokhbK-Oinerb9jJLLhPvfEGo5IzmDFxfc5IB9cACbxFP69TL1PMxoGRpRyS8Zfs04o8ZF9elttfUgx-N98uKhhggI0moZawnTN72aeXI7M1PJ15Y6boWV_gJCxV3QrxuL8LEwxes4369lKDHjUpC72RkfFke110hdljYak/s1248/nhk1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDmmjCLO7dI_xJpUn50EBBGokhbK-Oinerb9jJLLhPvfEGo5IzmDFxfc5IB9cACbxFP69TL1PMxoGRpRyS8Zfs04o8ZF9elttfUgx-N98uKhhggI0moZawnTN72aeXI7M1PJ15Y6boWV_gJCxV3QrxuL8LEwxes4369lKDHjUpC72RkfFke110hdljYak/w640-h358/nhk1.png" width="640" /></a></span></b>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  First in this list, first in every way. I\'ve had this on my wishlist since\n  January 2021 (!) and I\'d honestly given up hope of ever seeing it. And now here it\n  is. Or a demo, anyway. It\'s a <i>Wadjet Eye</i> title and almost certainly\n  their most ambitious to date. The pitch is "<i>...a deliciously twisted new take on vampire role-playing games as you take\n    over a failing nightclub on the wrong side of the tracks, and turn it into\n    your personal empire through seduction, intimidation, and careful use of\n    secret supernatural Gifts</i>" Might be a little too much on the management-sim side of things for me but\n  I have very high hopes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Nova Antarctica</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  A survival game set in Antarctica in the year 2900, where you play a child\n  who\'s been sent alone to the South Pole to investigate a mysterious signal.\n  Why a child?

The visuals did\n  contribute a lot to my choices as they always do but there\'s no point trying\n  to play a great-looking game in a genre for which you have no affinity, so\n  even the greatest pictures have to take second place to the gameplay. This\n  one\'s "<i>A futuristic, humorous, slapstick based point &amp; click adventure in the\n    shape of the 50th and 60th years.</i>" All of that sounds right up my street except maybe the slapstick. I do\n  really like the phrasing on "<i>50th and 60th years</i>", which I\n  <i>think </i>means the 1950s and \'60s. It does describe itself as "<i>retro and nostalgic</i>" (For the characters, that is, not the player, which is a clever conceit, if hard to parse.)\n  I have a feeling this one could be quite odd.

Unfotunately, in making that plan I hadn\'t allowed for the fact that it doesn\'t kick off until 10AM PAcific, which is six o\'clock in the evening here. That wouldn\'t be too late for me to pick and post but it would turn the whole thing into a bit of a race so I\'m going to leave it for tomorrow.<p></p><p>All of which means it\'s yet another First impressions post for <i>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</i>. Yay!</p><p>I guess at some point First Impressions have to give way to plain old Impressions. I think we might be getting close to that point now. I\'ve racked up just short of five hours, which is nothing for an MMORPG, but I\'m level 26 and I\'ve finished the first chapter of the main story quest so it feels as though I\'m well into the game.</p><p>And so far I\'m really enjoying it. I realised yesterday why I\'ve seen several reviews comparing it to<i> Final Fantasy XIV</i>.&nbsp; I though at first it was just that it\'s an MMO and that happened to be the one those reviewers knew best because certainly <i>BP:SR</i> doesn\'t seem to play much like the <i>FFXIV </i>I remember. Then, as I was trotting around <i>Asterleeds</i>, the main city, I started to notice how similar the architecture is to some of the locations I vaguely remember from that game.</p><p>It\'s been a long time since I saw any of the cities of <i>Eorzea </i>so I\'m vague on which, if any, Asterleeds might specifically ressemble. It\'s more the look and feel, all that wood paneling, the way the NPCs stand behind counters, the wide streets...

Yes, it keeps players both engaged and occupied but it also fosters the idea that once you\'re done with the story, you\'re done with the game. All that\'s left after that is a so-called end-game that\'s inevitably and unavoidably repetitive. For all the complaints about the "<i>grind</i>" of leveling in old-school MMORPGs , it\'s hard to see the current version as very much of an improvement. Or even all that different.</p><p>This, I\'m uncomfortably aware, is the hole I\'ve lowered myself into in <i>Wuthering Waves</i>. That game has a wealth of very satisfying and engaging content beyond the excellent MSQ and when I first started playing it I was having a fine old time exploring it all. At some point, though, I locked myself into the central storyline and the rest of the fascinating world disappeared behind a screen of (Admittedly first-rate.) cut scenes and set pieces.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPrO2_6Mk0mF3OKBxBM2yK3GsNl1tiOKVQ2cORgUef77YQ2c9sTM7sKwq6o8LuErwKbs7T57GyHe4-caguO7QsU7gJlVjJTU0z8OBI4CHtJDNRuaCxC-F0YCKQdFl3p8CUQ6tUkwHFUHg2BMxv1fSGE3ZN2PlFUm58PrRQB9jPuc6Xysn7RpT52Q0cXBQ/s1920/bpfish1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPrO2_6Mk0mF3OKBxBM2yK3GsNl1tiOKVQ2cORgUef77YQ2c9sTM7sKwq6o8LuErwKbs7T57GyHe4-caguO7QsU7gJlVjJTU0z8OBI4CHtJDNRuaCxC-F0YCKQdFl3p8CUQ6tUkwHFUHg2BMxv1fSGE3ZN2PlFUm58PrRQB9jPuc6Xysn7RpT52Q0cXBQ/w640-h360/bpfish1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>BP:SR is never going to have the same inherent literary or aesthetic value as the exceptional WW but the story running through the middle of it is still interesting enough to hold my attention and the game constantly nudges me to keep on with it to the exclusion of all else. Those nudges, though, are gentler and less persistent than in most games and that\'s why I\'m here now, considering my options.</p><p>When I play again later today, I think I\'m going to open up my Journal and start working through a few of those quests I seem to have picked up without even noticing. Maybe they\'ll be filler I wish I\'d skipped or maybe they\'ll be satisfying vignettes that shed light on the world <i>Floradelle </i>finds herself living in. Mostly, I suspect, they\'ll introduce me to aspects of the game I ought to know about.</p><p>One of them, for instance, introduces Fishing, which appears to be something entirely separate from Life Skills. There\'s another similarity with FFXIV.&nbsp; At least Fishing is always pretty straightforward. You know where you are with a fish.</p><p>Life Skills or Crafts are always a problem. In some games they\'re barely more than amusements and it makes no real difference which you pick but in others choosing the wrong one can be almost game-breaking. I\'ve never known any game give sufficient information up front to make that choice a truly informed one. It\'s always outside sources that tell you Class A <i>must </i>take Craft B and Craft B <i>needs</i> Secondary Craft C.</p><p>All of which means I\'ve already reached the point where I ought to do some research outside the game before I make any final decisions. Luckily, BP:SR is one of those games where there\'s plenty of advice available.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpwxvIJJFoLCpWu8XVwbEG66t6YyBD9MA5BDPJTPZ7sHjavscKON-BV5aK2QVBQT6Y0bL5hHeT9JxVD6wwWGKV0LZ81aRXoqm39D9jFHKhbl2JfXQg3Mo4A4XT-SrslofXsUID_xLhpcd_lna3oXcPALX01Us39VB8xCIGebhblUaBk3OIqwmL6cdJ3Ho/s1920/bpls1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpwxvIJJFoLCpWu8XVwbEG66t6YyBD9MA5BDPJTPZ7sHjavscKON-BV5aK2QVBQT6Y0bL5hHeT9JxVD6wwWGKV0LZ81aRXoqm39D9jFHKhbl2JfXQg3Mo4A4XT-SrslofXsUID_xLhpcd_lna3oXcPALX01Us39VB8xCIGebhblUaBk3OIqwmL6cdJ3Ho/w640-h360/bpls1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Here\'s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/blue-protocol/resources/life-skills-system-guide"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">an overview</span></a> of Life Skills. You\'ll note it says right at the start that they\'re "<i>a core part</i>" of the game, "<i>important for progressing your character</i>". Not just fluff for fun, then. <a href="https://maxroll.gg/blue-protocol/resources/weaving-guide"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">A detailed guide</span></a> to one of them, Weaving, makes it clear why that is: "<i>Weaving allows you to craft Epic and Legendary quality Intellect and Agility Helmets, Armor, Gauntlets, and Boots for the Verdant Oracle, Beat Performer, Frost Mage, Stormblade, and Marksman classes, as well as Strength, Intellect, and Agility Charms.</i>"</p><p>That does sound like it would be important. Fortunately, as <i>Icy Veins</i> <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/other-games/news/mastering-life-skills-in-blue-protocol-star-resonance/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">explains</span></a>, "<i>You’re not locked into just one or two professions. You can pick up as many Life Skills as you want</i>". The real limitation here is something called <i>Focus</i>, one of those infamous time-gated resources.&nbsp;</p><p>I think I prefer being able to learn all the crafts but not always having the energy to do them to always having enough puff but being locked into specific skills. I suppose being able to take them all and never having any limitations on their use would be the ideal but even that would present problems of its own in terms of the investment and commitment required to take advantage of that degree of freedom.</p><p>There\'s probably no perfect solution. So long as whatever\'s there seems fair within its context, it ought to be acceptable. Based on previous experiences in similar games, in my case, it\'s highly unlikely I\'ll ever do enough crafting to run up against the timegates, so from my perspective it will probably seem like I have complete freedom anyway.</p><p>Unless I really get into the housing, that is. Oh yes, there\'s housing! And you can craft furniture. That is the one place where I\'ve found myself hitting the limits in the past.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5gc2RrypZkbDsvcavXxcgbf0lqqm6AtOf-qHIp477EnYN2P5R4P263lfyKX7ZNdqdVJN8-bcum3MFcPBFUVt-9LsMk9tcTX6QLM9emXDKOO2UFtAnqCW9uLKIvtV1X5ee09Vc-ewRpTyG-RcI1Z3vLy5PqPYEZ84Bc4O1uNh3tq4eswYfl5LMC4ySTlE/s1920/bproom4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5gc2RrypZkbDsvcavXxcgbf0lqqm6AtOf-qHIp477EnYN2P5R4P263lfyKX7ZNdqdVJN8-bcum3MFcPBFUVt-9LsMk9tcTX6QLM9emXDKOO2UFtAnqCW9uLKIvtV1X5ee09Vc-ewRpTyG-RcI1Z3vLy5PqPYEZ84Bc4O1uNh3tq4eswYfl5LMC4ySTlE/w640-h360/bproom4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>I thought I\'d gained access to the housing feature yesterday, when the Mayor of Asterleeds gave me a rent-free room in the inn for as long as I needed it, in gratitude for a service I\'d done the city. I went straight to my room to see if that had opened up some customization features but the only change I found there was another player, asleep on my bed.</p><p>Which was weird. I thought at first it might be an NPC, like the ones that moved themselves into my houses all the time in <i>Chimeraland </i>but no, it was definitely a player. So much for it being my room. I expect he\'d saved the city, too.</p><p>That got me to go look up housing and it turns out the feature doesn\'t open up until Level 40. Whatever the Mayor gave me, it wasn\'t that. Knowing it\'s coming is a big motivation for me to carry on until I get the real thing, though.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The one other significant thing I did while I was playing yesterday was to join in a big fight with an open world boss or an elite or something. I was out doing something entirely different when I saw the huge creature wandering about. I went over to have a look and a couple of people were attacking it so I joined in.</p><p>It was all very reminiscent of similar events in <i>Guild Wars 2</i> or perhaps more specifically in <i>Bless Unleashed</i>, although in the latter game the fights were a lot harder. This one, some species of Ogre, had a lot of hit points, so it took several minutes to kill, even with a lot of players joining in as the fight went on. There didn\'t seem to be any complicated mechanics to deal with. The boss fired off plenty of AEs but as a Marksman, using a bow, I was positioned well out of range so I can\'t say what they did.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxToUhS9dYXayFn32MbuIVxSAF1c3krbxST6v3ehJEo5EMbytEnSZ5VOqNgyk7QBCvl5dEm5A0PgNgHwRRrHteHc43VjiJ8ZymTL3QuSo-xRfUhrilF7wXk3N944ZqAjxarS9hT0JfvN9RVmYvP1qHHUsUx3GiB212XPBWpXHrFdlY8JF93ukXmWdxNVM/s1170/bpel1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="416" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxToUhS9dYXayFn32MbuIVxSAF1c3krbxST6v3ehJEo5EMbytEnSZ5VOqNgyk7QBCvl5dEm5A0PgNgHwRRrHteHc43VjiJ8ZymTL3QuSo-xRfUhrilF7wXk3N944ZqAjxarS9hT0JfvN9RVmYvP1qHHUsUx3GiB212XPBWpXHrFdlY8JF93ukXmWdxNVM/w640-h416/bpel1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>It was fun. For me. I really like open group events where all you do is stand still, firing off all your skills over and over. I like it even better with auto-battling, when I don\'t even have to hold down a key, much less go through any kind of rotation. I can see why it\'s not to everyone\'s taste but as I said yesterday, there are lots of games out there; if that\'s not your kick, maybe try another.</p><p>Everything considered, I\'m finding the propspects for BP:SR quite encouraging. There\'s not much about it I don\'t like yet and a lot that I do. It probably doesn\'t have a lot of substance but evidence suggests that several fairly recent games I ended up giving a lot of my time didn\'t, either. <i>Noah\'s Heart </i>and <i>Dawnlands </i>come immediately to mind but there have been quite a few. I\'m pretty shallow when it comes to games.</p><p>Most of those games, though, didn\'t do all that well. Some of them have closed down now and the rest are mouldering in maintenance mode, forgotten by the world. I have some hope Blue Protocol: Star Resonance might do a little better than that but it\'s early days yet.</p><p>And with that, I think my First Impressions are probably done. From now, it\'ll just be notes on a game I\'m playing.&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJ7S9vD5vGjmBXwRWuzXwNhx5PmyaidcETLnZCCcfKl3DVBvzeBKJrWVm7lFpaTcojcwRsAQhb2B0PTtlIKAEp6WxMv6bj8xXwn7F3C6lIp148OhjRznGX_BOqb6lG29xAHFHhOL1AZLUn_RKxBhowl4UFP1-efnqad9P8GHMC5meQX5qCU6qabjnQFlg/s1280/bpflo1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJ7S9vD5vGjmBXwRWuzXwNhx5PmyaidcETLnZCCcfKl3DVBvzeBKJrWVm7lFpaTcojcwRsAQhb2B0PTtlIKAEp6WxMv6bj8xXwn7F3C6lIp148OhjRznGX_BOqb6lG29xAHFHhOL1AZLUn_RKxBhowl4UFP1-efnqad9P8GHMC5meQX5qCU6qabjnQFlg/w640-h360/bpflo1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />The plan for today\'s post was to run through the demos I\'d picked for the latest <i>Steam Next Fest</i>, which starts today and runs for a week. Unfotunately, in making that plan I hadn\'t allowed for the fact that it doesn\'t kick off until 10AM PAcific, which is six o\'clock in the evening here. That wouldn\'t be too late for me to pick and post but it would turn the whole thing into a bit of a race so I\'m going to leave it for tomorrow.<p></p><p>All of which means it\'s yet another First impressions post for <i>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</i>. Yay!</p><p>I guess at some point First Impressions have to give way to plain old Impressions. I think we might be getting close to that point now. I\'ve racked up just short of five hours, which is nothing for an MMORPG, but I\'m level 26 and I\'ve finished the first chapter of the main story quest so it feels as though I\'m well into the game.</p><p>And so far I\'m really enjoying it. I realised yesterday why I\'ve seen several reviews comparing it to<i> Final Fantasy XIV</i>.&nbsp; I though at first it was just that it\'s an MMO and that happened to be the one those reviewers knew best because certainly <i>BP:SR</i> doesn\'t seem to play much like the <i>FFXIV </i>I remember. Then, as I was trotting around <i>Asterleeds</i>, the main city, I started to notice how similar the architecture is to some of the locations I vaguely remember from that game.</p><p>It\'s been a long time since I saw any of the cities of <i>Eorzea </i>so I\'m vague on which, if any, Asterleeds might specifically ressemble. It\'s more the look and feel, all that wood paneling, the way the NPCs stand behind counters, the wide streets... True, lots of cities in lots of MMOs have a similar design aesthetic but I can\'t say any of them have reminded me of FFXIV quite as much as this.</p><p>There\'s also the catalog of creatures to kill, something I recall playing a significant part in FFXIV but again, lots of games have something similar. If there are any more specific similarities, I imagine you\'d need to be more tuned in to <i>Square Enix</i>\'s game than I am to spot them.

For all the complaints about the "<i>grind</i>" of leveling in old-school MMORPGs , it\'s hard to see the current version as very much of an improvement. Or even all that different.</p><p>This, I\'m uncomfortably aware, is the hole I\'ve lowered myself into in <i>Wuthering Waves</i>. That game has a wealth of very satisfying and engaging content beyond the excellent MSQ and when I first started playing it I was having a fine old time exploring it all. At some point, though, I locked myself into the central storyline and the rest of the fascinating world disappeared behind a screen of (Admittedly first-rate.) cut scenes and set pieces.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPrO2_6Mk0mF3OKBxBM2yK3GsNl1tiOKVQ2cORgUef77YQ2c9sTM7sKwq6o8LuErwKbs7T57GyHe4-caguO7QsU7gJlVjJTU0z8OBI4CHtJDNRuaCxC-F0YCKQdFl3p8CUQ6tUkwHFUHg2BMxv1fSGE3ZN2PlFUm58PrRQB9jPuc6Xysn7RpT52Q0cXBQ/s1920/bpfish1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPrO2_6Mk0mF3OKBxBM2yK3GsNl1tiOKVQ2cORgUef77YQ2c9sTM7sKwq6o8LuErwKbs7T57GyHe4-caguO7QsU7gJlVjJTU0z8OBI4CHtJDNRuaCxC-F0YCKQdFl3p8CUQ6tUkwHFUHg2BMxv1fSGE3ZN2PlFUm58PrRQB9jPuc6Xysn7RpT52Q0cXBQ/w640-h360/bpfish1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>BP:SR is never going to have the same inherent literary or aesthetic value as the exceptional WW but the story running through the middle of it is still interesting enough to hold my attention and the game constantly nudges me to keep on with it to the exclusion of all else. Those nudges, though, are gentler and less persistent than in most games and that\'s why I\'m here now, considering my options.</p><p>When I play again later today, I think I\'m going to open up my Journal and start working through a few of those quests I seem to have picked up without even noticing. Maybe they\'ll be filler I wish I\'d skipped or maybe they\'ll be satisfying vignettes that shed light on the world <i>Floradelle </i>finds herself living in. Mostly, I suspect, they\'ll introduce me to aspects of the game I ought to know about.</p><p>One of them, for instance, introduces Fishing, which appears to be something entirely separate from Life Skills. There\'s another similarity with FFXIV.&nbsp; At least Fishing is always pretty straightforward. You know where you are with a fish.</p><p>Life Skills or Crafts are always a problem. In some games they\'re barely more than amusements and it makes no real difference which you pick but in others choosing the wrong one can be almost game-breaking. I\'ve never known any game give sufficient information up front to make that choice a truly informed one. It\'s always outside sources that tell you Class A <i>must </i>take Craft B and Craft B <i>needs</i> Secondary Craft C.</p><p>All of which means I\'ve already reached the point where I ought to do some research outside the game before I make any final decisions. Luckily, BP:SR is one of those games where there\'s plenty of advice available.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpwxvIJJFoLCpWu8XVwbEG66t6YyBD9MA5BDPJTPZ7sHjavscKON-BV5aK2QVBQT6Y0bL5hHeT9JxVD6wwWGKV0LZ81aRXoqm39D9jFHKhbl2JfXQg3Mo4A4XT-SrslofXsUID_xLhpcd_lna3oXcPALX01Us39VB8xCIGebhblUaBk3OIqwmL6cdJ3Ho/s1920/bpls1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpwxvIJJFoLCpWu8XVwbEG66t6YyBD9MA5BDPJTPZ7sHjavscKON-BV5aK2QVBQT6Y0bL5hHeT9JxVD6wwWGKV0LZ81aRXoqm39D9jFHKhbl2JfXQg3Mo4A4XT-SrslofXsUID_xLhpcd_lna3oXcPALX01Us39VB8xCIGebhblUaBk3OIqwmL6cdJ3Ho/w640-h360/bpls1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Here\'s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/blue-protocol/resources/life-skills-system-guide"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">an overview</span></a> of Life Skills. You\'ll note it says right at the start that they\'re "<i>a core part</i>" of the game, "<i>important for progressing your character</i>". Not just fluff for fun, then. <a href="https://maxroll.gg/blue-protocol/resources/weaving-guide"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">A detailed guide</span></a> to one of them, Weaving, makes it clear why that is: "<i>Weaving allows you to craft Epic and Legendary quality Intellect and Agility Helmets, Armor, Gauntlets, and Boots for the Verdant Oracle, Beat Performer, Frost Mage, Stormblade, and Marksman classes, as well as Strength, Intellect, and Agility Charms.</i>"</p><p>That does sound like it would be important. Fortunately, as <i>Icy Veins</i> <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/other-games/news/mastering-life-skills-in-blue-protocol-star-resonance/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">explains</span></a>, "<i>You’re not locked into just one or two professions. You can pick up as many Life Skills as you want</i>". The real limitation here is something called <i>Focus</i>, one of those infamous time-gated resources.&nbsp;</p><p>I think I prefer being able to learn all the crafts but not always having the energy to do them to always having enough puff but being locked into specific skills. I suppose being able to take them all and never having any limitations on their use would be the ideal but even that would present problems of its own in terms of the investment and commitment required to take advantage of that degree of freedom.</p><p>There\'s probably no perfect solution. So long as whatever\'s there seems fair within its context, it ought to be acceptable. Based on previous experiences in similar games, in my case, it\'s highly unlikely I\'ll ever do enough crafting to run up against the timegates, so from my perspective it will probably seem like I have complete freedom anyway.</p><p>Unless I really get into the housing, that is. Oh yes, there\'s housing! And you can craft furniture. That is the one place where I\'ve found myself hitting the limits in the past.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5gc2RrypZkbDsvcavXxcgbf0lqqm6AtOf-qHIp477EnYN2P5R4P263lfyKX7ZNdqdVJN8-bcum3MFcPBFUVt-9LsMk9tcTX6QLM9emXDKOO2UFtAnqCW9uLKIvtV1X5ee09Vc-ewRpTyG-RcI1Z3vLy5PqPYEZ84Bc4O1uNh3tq4eswYfl5LMC4ySTlE/s1920/bproom4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5gc2RrypZkbDsvcavXxcgbf0lqqm6AtOf-qHIp477EnYN2P5R4P263lfyKX7ZNdqdVJN8-bcum3MFcPBFUVt-9LsMk9tcTX6QLM9emXDKOO2UFtAnqCW9uLKIvtV1X5ee09Vc-ewRpTyG-RcI1Z3vLy5PqPYEZ84Bc4O1uNh3tq4eswYfl5LMC4ySTlE/w640-h360/bproom4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>I thought I\'d gained access to the housing feature yesterday, when the Mayor of Asterleeds gave me a rent-free room in the inn for as long as I needed it, in gratitude for a service I\'d done the city. I went straight to my room to see if that had opened up some customization features but the only change I found there was another player, asleep on my bed.</p><p>Which was weird. I thought at first it might be an NPC, like the ones that moved themselves into my houses all the time in <i>Chimeraland </i>but no, it was definitely a player. So much for it being my room. I expect he\'d saved the city, too.</p><p>That got me to go look up housing and it turns out the feature doesn\'t open up until Level 40. Whatever the Mayor gave me, it wasn\'t that. Knowing it\'s coming is a big motivation for me to carry on until I get the real thing, though.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The one other significant thing I did while I was playing yesterday was to join in a big fight with an open world boss or an elite or something. I was out doing something entirely different when I saw the huge creature wandering about. I went over to have a look and a couple of people were attacking it so I joined in.</p><p>It was all very reminiscent of similar events in <i>Guild Wars 2</i> or perhaps more specifically in <i>Bless Unleashed</i>, although in the latter game the fights were a lot harder. This one, some species of Ogre, had a lot of hit points, so it took several minutes to kill, even with a lot of players joining in as the fight went on. There didn\'t seem to be any complicated mechanics to deal with. The boss fired off plenty of AEs but as a Marksman, using a bow, I was positioned well out of range so I can\'t say what they did.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxToUhS9dYXayFn32MbuIVxSAF1c3krbxST6v3ehJEo5EMbytEnSZ5VOqNgyk7QBCvl5dEm5A0PgNgHwRRrHteHc43VjiJ8ZymTL3QuSo-xRfUhrilF7wXk3N944ZqAjxarS9hT0JfvN9RVmYvP1qHHUsUx3GiB212XPBWpXHrFdlY8JF93ukXmWdxNVM/s1170/bpel1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="416" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxToUhS9dYXayFn32MbuIVxSAF1c3krbxST6v3ehJEo5EMbytEnSZ5VOqNgyk7QBCvl5dEm5A0PgNgHwRRrHteHc43VjiJ8ZymTL3QuSo-xRfUhrilF7wXk3N944ZqAjxarS9hT0JfvN9RVmYvP1qHHUsUx3GiB212XPBWpXHrFdlY8JF93ukXmWdxNVM/w640-h416/bpel1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>It was fun. For me. I really like open group events where all you do is stand still, firing off all your skills over and over. I like it even better with auto-battling, when I don\'t even have to hold down a key, much less go through any kind of rotation. I can see why it\'s not to everyone\'s taste but as I said yesterday, there are lots of games out there; if that\'s not your kick, maybe try another.</p><p>Everything considered, I\'m finding the propspects for BP:SR quite encouraging. There\'s not much about it I don\'t like yet and a lot that I do. It probably doesn\'t have a lot of substance but evidence suggests that several fairly recent games I ended up giving a lot of my time didn\'t, either. <i>Noah\'s Heart </i>and <i>Dawnlands </i>come immediately to mind but there have been quite a few. I\'m pretty shallow when it comes to games.</p><p>Most of those games, though, didn\'t do all that well. Some of them have closed down now and the rest are mouldering in maintenance mode, forgotten by the world. I have some hope Blue Protocol: Star Resonance might do a little better than that but it\'s early days yet.</p><p>And with that, I think my First Impressions are probably done. From now, it\'ll just be notes on a game I\'m playing.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/blue-protocol-star-resonance-final.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/blue-protocol-star-resonance-final.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJ7S9vD5vGjmBXwRWuzXwNhx5PmyaidcETLnZCCcfKl3DVBvzeBKJrWVm7lFpaTcojcwRsAQhb2B0PTtlIKAEp6WxMv6bj8xXwn7F3C6lIp148OhjRznGX_BOqb6lG29xAHFHhOL1AZLUn_RKxBhowl4UFP1-efnqad9P8GHMC5meQX5qCU6qabjnQFlg/s72-w640-h360-c/bpflo1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

That\'s what your all asking, isn\'t it? Isn\'t it? Well, I\'m going to tell you anyway.</p><p>It\'s going pretty well as far as I can make out. As I write, at just before nine in the morning, UK time, on a Sunday, there are almost forty-six thousand people playing on <i>Steam</i> (Sixty-two thousand as I edit this at five PM.)&nbsp;from an all-time peak of just under eighty thousand. It\'s clearly holding an audience for the time being. Recent history for just about all MMORPGs released on Steam in the last couple of years suggests another month will see a huge fall-off in numbers but maybe this will be the sticky exception to that unfortunate trend.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, I was going to make a comparison with <i>Crystal of Atlan</i>, a somewhat similar game that launched back at the beginning of summer and which I was playing quite regularly, until suddenly I wasn\'t. Unfortunately, the Steam chart for that game isn\'t working. It brings up an "<i>Internal Server Error</i>", something I\'ve never seen before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And guess why that is. I just figured it out. Crystal of Atlan isn\'t on Steam! I\'ve been playing it through it\'s own standalone launcher for which I have a desktop icon. But I have lots of desktop icons for Steam games too so that\'s easy to forgive. I\'m so used to everything I play being on Steam I just assume that\'s where everything that\'s not really old is going, even if I\'m clicking my desktop to get there.</p><p>So how if it\'s not on Steam, how come the Steam chart even recognizes Crystal of Atlan to give me the error message? Shouldn\'t it just be telling me it doesn\'t exist? That turns out to be because <i>CoA </i>is coming to Steam in just over two weeks, on the 30 October.&nbsp; I don\'t know if it\'s going to be possible to link an existing account to Steam when it happens but I hope so. I might start playing again then.</p><p>Let\'s get back to BP:SR. That\'s what we\'re here for, after all. The numbers look good. How about the reviews? Those were very bad for a while. Have they improved?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2drcdmDq9Uvtu7-arzZBhCVpebUBLdNmFG36aa-V4vZInFqkW5iVCtRE9lQoOW02MPs434OFO8ltXE-WQXiz4Wucb_tJD6ec3ID3q8rpDdf0CEdiO_UldY7CLfYKXmzPeUQSJqX3f6M3OWryBBtaJx0zld-QpMTJDnNzDlG6rmGrWOteWYG775gcvTiw/s1920/bproom2.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2drcdmDq9Uvtu7-arzZBhCVpebUBLdNmFG36aa-V4vZInFqkW5iVCtRE9lQoOW02MPs434OFO8ltXE-WQXiz4Wucb_tJD6ec3ID3q8rpDdf0CEdiO_UldY7CLfYKXmzPeUQSJqX3f6M3OWryBBtaJx0zld-QpMTJDnNzDlG6rmGrWOteWYG775gcvTiw/w640-h360/bproom2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Yep. A lot. The overall rating is "<i>Mixed</i>" now from a shade under five thousand reviews, of which 48% are positive. That\'s not so much mixed as polarized. It\'s too soon for there to be a "<i>Recent</i>" filter - all the reviews are "<i>recent</i>", the game not having been out for a week yet - but the selection of new reviews highlighted on the main page seem far less hysterical, whether they recommend the game or not.</p><p>It would seem logical that all the pile-ons who never planned on playing the game, the ones who only wanted to have a bit of cruel fun poking it with a stick, have moved on to the next target, leaving mostly people who actually want to give the game a fair shake. And most of those players are saying things like "<i>It\'s pretty fun for what it is: a casual oriented F2P anime MMO</i>" and "<i>Free to play anime mmo with gatch. Not bad for what it is.</i>"&nbsp;</p><p>Even the negative reviews are far more balanced now, often making some positive points before concluding the game isn\'t for them. There\'s praise for the visuals, the cosmetics, the world-building, the characters and even, in a minority of cases, the gameplay and combat. The main issues people can\'t seem to get over are the time-gating, the myriad currencies and the general mobile free-to-playness of the whole shebang.</p><p>Which is fair. Both the negatives and the positives are in harmony there. It\'s a port of a Chinese F2P mobile MMO that\'s had some, but not a lot, of work done to fit it for a PC audience. If you\'re cool with that, then BP:SR is a decent game. If you\'re not, it\'s annoying and not worth your time. Seems reasonable.</p><p>There was one review that really stood out for me, though. It\'s very short. I\'ll quote it in full.</p><p></p><blockquote><b><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really boring game I ever played. Just more talk than action anything. This game really not interesting if just more talk and no action."</span></b></blockquote><p></p><p></p><blockquote></blockquote><p></p><p>I totally see where the writer is coming from, although I disagree strongly with their conclusion. I have just over three and a half hours played now and I would estimate no more than ten or fifteen minutes of that has been spent fighting mobs or bosses. An action MMO it is not.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd32SkEzL4kjWKuR6syRzCTJp_A7G6ijERhDxyvUp-iQPMf-jnFNLa1oA4-P1iNDvBhn6dXY-Z9cs_D-Lwg5Bs9bHFe_xJ_UjxkZyX1NXAi16p08RTWvkeT_1e4HWg0Vb_l1hs48JtqNBGHxhGgLPUt9KUInCtuiKJXPuwKBkQ-YkNrpSMTq6KIiLdX88/s1920/bplight1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd32SkEzL4kjWKuR6syRzCTJp_A7G6ijERhDxyvUp-iQPMf-jnFNLa1oA4-P1iNDvBhn6dXY-Z9cs_D-Lwg5Bs9bHFe_xJ_UjxkZyX1NXAi16p08RTWvkeT_1e4HWg0Vb_l1hs48JtqNBGHxhGgLPUt9KUInCtuiKJXPuwKBkQ-YkNrpSMTq6KIiLdX88/w640-h360/bplight1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p></p><p>Travel, which often bulks out the played time in any kind of open world game, isn\'t taking up the slack either. There\'s the usual amount of running about but the distances involved are very small. Frequently, the next person you need to speak to is standing right across the street from where you are. New locations you have to visit are often less than fifty yards away. There are teleport points everywhere but as yet it hasn\'t even been worth using them.</p><p>No, almost all of my three and a half hours has been spent either talking to NPCs or listening to them talk to each other. There are some proper, animated cut scenes but far more of those tableaus where you see all the characters standing in the foreground having long conversations to which you are occasionally invited to contribute.</p><p>"<i>More talk than action</i>" is a very accurate description of the gameplay so far. Whether you find that boring or entertaining will be entirely down to your personal preferences. Personally, I\'ve been enjoying it quite a bit. It\'s not great literature, even by gaming standards, but it\'s witty in places, light-hearted and cheerful and it\'s largely been a pleasure letting it all drift past as I watch and read.</p><p>I see from some of the other reviews that the "<i>end game</i>" involves a lot of repeated dungeon-running, for which you need energy of some kind as is the norm in these games. That\'s why people are complaining about the time-gating. I don\'t know how long it takes to get to that point, although if people are complaining about it already it can\'t be very long. I\'ve seen five hours mentioned although that seems very fast to complete a full main story quest.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s very likely my experience is going to be the reverse of what the commenter I quoted above was complaining about. I imagine I\'ll find the part when the talk stops and the action begins to be the boring bit. I certainly won\'t be running any dungeons more than once or twice, that\'s for sure. It\'s more likely I won\'t set foot in them at all unless the story demands it and even then they\'d better be easy or I\'ll be off.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT3y1io-xpPXdJdJXlR7ZkOO7DcN_G3668WaptMsLe0stKrrUOT-lg44iHg9sclNqZWDBxqQoAtTtODdSqaJKcEazWhNUW3CLX9iBd5l_MltTGT-gFCUX2dvzQ5byLN6goiJvlDLdEa9hBY8F_pTZtkg1cbfWY5hiiVMJiLaNMH4FT2uqfG-AAAXOeruc/s1920/bpbar1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT3y1io-xpPXdJdJXlR7ZkOO7DcN_G3668WaptMsLe0stKrrUOT-lg44iHg9sclNqZWDBxqQoAtTtODdSqaJKcEazWhNUW3CLX9iBd5l_MltTGT-gFCUX2dvzQ5byLN6goiJvlDLdEa9hBY8F_pTZtkg1cbfWY5hiiVMJiLaNMH4FT2uqfG-AAAXOeruc/w640-h360/bpbar1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I am clearly not the real target market for the games I enjoy, which is a bit weird when I think about it. It\'s not just that I\'m too old for them, although obviously I am. I completed a survey for the game last night and the upper age limit was 36+. I was older than that when I started playing online games, back in the 90s!</p><p>I tend to like the parts of these games I suspect the intended audience would prefer weren\'t there at all. The pointless busy-work of the side quests, the derivitive and poorly-writen storylines, the unecessary cross-country travel, the myriad crafting mats I pick up and then leave in storage and never use...</p><p>And I like seeing the sights and taking holiday snaps with the quirky in-game cameras.

Levels come very fast, which is nice, although it also suggests the leveling process is short and that "<i>end game</i>" (Which I keep putting in quotes because if people are in it a matter of hours or even days from launch, it probably ought just to be called "<i>the game</i>".) is going to arrive all too soon.</p><p>Levels come so fast I can\'t keep up.

I have a ton of skills and talents and other stuff to upgrade that I\'ve been trying to ignore because to me<i> that\'s </i>the boring part.

That\'s what your all asking, isn\'t it? Isn\'t it? Well, I\'m going to tell you anyway.</p><p>It\'s going pretty well as far as I can make out. As I write, at just before nine in the morning, UK time, on a Sunday, there are almost forty-six thousand people playing on <i>Steam</i> (Sixty-two thousand as I edit this at five PM.)&nbsp;from an all-time peak of just under eighty thousand. It\'s clearly holding an audience for the time being. Recent history for just about all MMORPGs released on Steam in the last couple of years suggests another month will see a huge fall-off in numbers but maybe this will be the sticky exception to that unfortunate trend.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, I was going to make a comparison with <i>Crystal of Atlan</i>, a somewhat similar game that launched back at the beginning of summer and which I was playing quite regularly, until suddenly I wasn\'t. Unfortunately, the Steam chart for that game isn\'t working. It brings up an "<i>Internal Server Error</i>", something I\'ve never seen before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And guess why that is. I just figured it out. Crystal of Atlan isn\'t on Steam! I\'ve been playing it through it\'s own standalone launcher for which I have a desktop icon. But I have lots of desktop icons for Steam games too so that\'s easy to forgive. I\'m so used to everything I play being on Steam I just assume that\'s where everything that\'s not really old is going, even if I\'m clicking my desktop to get there.</p><p>So how if it\'s not on Steam, how come the Steam chart even recognizes Crystal of Atlan to give me the error message? Shouldn\'t it just be telling me it doesn\'t exist? That turns out to be because <i>CoA </i>is coming to Steam in just over two weeks, on the 30 October.&nbsp; I don\'t know if it\'s going to be possible to link an existing account to Steam when it happens but I hope so. I might start playing again then.</p><p>Let\'s get back to BP:SR. That\'s what we\'re here for, after all. The numbers look good. How about the reviews? Those were very bad for a while. Have they improved?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2drcdmDq9Uvtu7-arzZBhCVpebUBLdNmFG36aa-V4vZInFqkW5iVCtRE9lQoOW02MPs434OFO8ltXE-WQXiz4Wucb_tJD6ec3ID3q8rpDdf0CEdiO_UldY7CLfYKXmzPeUQSJqX3f6M3OWryBBtaJx0zld-QpMTJDnNzDlG6rmGrWOteWYG775gcvTiw/s1920/bproom2.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2drcdmDq9Uvtu7-arzZBhCVpebUBLdNmFG36aa-V4vZInFqkW5iVCtRE9lQoOW02MPs434OFO8ltXE-WQXiz4Wucb_tJD6ec3ID3q8rpDdf0CEdiO_UldY7CLfYKXmzPeUQSJqX3f6M3OWryBBtaJx0zld-QpMTJDnNzDlG6rmGrWOteWYG775gcvTiw/w640-h360/bproom2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Yep. A lot. The overall rating is "<i>Mixed</i>" now from a shade under five thousand reviews, of which 48% are positive. That\'s not so much mixed as polarized. It\'s too soon for there to be a "<i>Recent</i>" filter - all the reviews are "<i>recent</i>", the game not having been out for a week yet - but the selection of new reviews highlighted on the main page seem far less hysterical, whether they recommend the game or not.</p><p>It would seem logical that all the pile-ons who never planned on playing the game, the ones who only wanted to have a bit of cruel fun poking it with a stick, have moved on to the next target, leaving mostly people who actually want to give the game a fair shake. And most of those players are saying things like "<i>It\'s pretty fun for what it is: a casual oriented F2P anime MMO</i>" and "<i>Free to play anime mmo with gatch. Not bad for what it is.</i>"&nbsp;</p><p>Even the negative reviews are far more balanced now, often making some positive points before concluding the game isn\'t for them. There\'s praise for the visuals, the cosmetics, the world-building, the characters and even, in a minority of cases, the gameplay and combat. The main issues people can\'t seem to get over are the time-gating, the myriad currencies and the general mobile free-to-playness of the whole shebang.</p><p>Which is fair. Both the negatives and the positives are in harmony there. It\'s a port of a Chinese F2P mobile MMO that\'s had some, but not a lot, of work done to fit it for a PC audience. If you\'re cool with that, then BP:SR is a decent game. If you\'re not, it\'s annoying and not worth your time. Seems reasonable.</p><p>There was one review that really stood out for me, though. It\'s very short. I\'ll quote it in full.</p><p></p><blockquote><b><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really boring game I ever played. Just more talk than action anything. This game really not interesting if just more talk and no action."</span></b></blockquote><p></p><p></p><blockquote></blockquote><p></p><p>I totally see where the writer is coming from, although I disagree strongly with their conclusion. I have just over three and a half hours played now and I would estimate no more than ten or fifteen minutes of that has been spent fighting mobs or bosses. An action MMO it is not.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd32SkEzL4kjWKuR6syRzCTJp_A7G6ijERhDxyvUp-iQPMf-jnFNLa1oA4-P1iNDvBhn6dXY-Z9cs_D-Lwg5Bs9bHFe_xJ_UjxkZyX1NXAi16p08RTWvkeT_1e4HWg0Vb_l1hs48JtqNBGHxhGgLPUt9KUInCtuiKJXPuwKBkQ-YkNrpSMTq6KIiLdX88/s1920/bplight1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd32SkEzL4kjWKuR6syRzCTJp_A7G6ijERhDxyvUp-iQPMf-jnFNLa1oA4-P1iNDvBhn6dXY-Z9cs_D-Lwg5Bs9bHFe_xJ_UjxkZyX1NXAi16p08RTWvkeT_1e4HWg0Vb_l1hs48JtqNBGHxhGgLPUt9KUInCtuiKJXPuwKBkQ-YkNrpSMTq6KIiLdX88/w640-h360/bplight1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p></p><p>Travel, which often bulks out the played time in any kind of open world game, isn\'t taking up the slack either. There\'s the usual amount of running about but the distances involved are very small. Frequently, the next person you need to speak to is standing right across the street from where you are. New locations you have to visit are often less than fifty yards away. There are teleport points everywhere but as yet it hasn\'t even been worth using them.</p><p>No, almost all of my three and a half hours has been spent either talking to NPCs or listening to them talk to each other. There are some proper, animated cut scenes but far more of those tableaus where you see all the characters standing in the foreground having long conversations to which you are occasionally invited to contribute.</p><p>"<i>More talk than action</i>" is a very accurate description of the gameplay so far. Whether you find that boring or entertaining will be entirely down to your personal preferences. Personally, I\'ve been enjoying it quite a bit. It\'s not great literature, even by gaming standards, but it\'s witty in places, light-hearted and cheerful and it\'s largely been a pleasure letting it all drift past as I watch and read.</p><p>I see from some of the other reviews that the "<i>end game</i>" involves a lot of repeated dungeon-running, for which you need energy of some kind as is the norm in these games. That\'s why people are complaining about the time-gating. I don\'t know how long it takes to get to that point, although if people are complaining about it already it can\'t be very long. I\'ve seen five hours mentioned although that seems very fast to complete a full main story quest.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s very likely my experience is going to be the reverse of what the commenter I quoted above was complaining about. I imagine I\'ll find the part when the talk stops and the action begins to be the boring bit. I certainly won\'t be running any dungeons more than once or twice, that\'s for sure. It\'s more likely I won\'t set foot in them at all unless the story demands it and even then they\'d better be easy or I\'ll be off.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT3y1io-xpPXdJdJXlR7ZkOO7DcN_G3668WaptMsLe0stKrrUOT-lg44iHg9sclNqZWDBxqQoAtTtODdSqaJKcEazWhNUW3CLX9iBd5l_MltTGT-gFCUX2dvzQ5byLN6goiJvlDLdEa9hBY8F_pTZtkg1cbfWY5hiiVMJiLaNMH4FT2uqfG-AAAXOeruc/s1920/bpbar1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT3y1io-xpPXdJdJXlR7ZkOO7DcN_G3668WaptMsLe0stKrrUOT-lg44iHg9sclNqZWDBxqQoAtTtODdSqaJKcEazWhNUW3CLX9iBd5l_MltTGT-gFCUX2dvzQ5byLN6goiJvlDLdEa9hBY8F_pTZtkg1cbfWY5hiiVMJiLaNMH4FT2uqfG-AAAXOeruc/w640-h360/bpbar1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I am clearly not the real target market for the games I enjoy, which is a bit weird when I think about it. It\'s not just that I\'m too old for them, although obviously I am. I completed a survey for the game last night and the upper age limit was 36+. I was older than that when I started playing online games, back in the 90s!</p><p>I tend to like the parts of these games I suspect the intended audience would prefer weren\'t there at all. The pointless busy-work of the side quests, the derivitive and poorly-writen storylines, the unecessary cross-country travel, the myriad crafting mats I pick up and then leave in storage and never use...</p><p>And I like seeing the sights and taking holiday snaps with the quirky in-game cameras. BP:SR has one of those and it\'s quite good although I haven\'t quite figured out exactly how all the controls work quite yet. I\'m having fun playing around with them though. I\'ll be trying the Selfie option next so there\'s something to look forward to.</p><p>Another thing I\'ve seen plenty of complaints about are the many currencies the game uses.

No video for this one. Won\'t bother some people. (Hi, <i>Redbeard</i>!) Also we\'ve had some\n  good videos already. We can afford to give our eyes a rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t know why but I keep thinking <i>Miya Folick</i>\'s an actor with a\n  side-hustle as a pop star, like a lot of them. She\'s not. She\'s a full-time singer-songwriter. She did study\n  acting but I don\'t think she\'s ever done it for a living.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I got that from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miya_Folick"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">her Wikipedia page</span></a>. Just this week I was having a chat with someone at work about AI, warning\n  them to double-check everything, which of course means doing the work yourself\n  so why even bother asking AI to begin with? I mention it because it just\n  occurred to me to I probably ought to check Miya\'s pronouns before I go to\n  print so I ran "<i>Miya Folick pronouns</i>" through Google and the helpful AI\n  summary at the top confidently told me "<i>Miya Folick uses they/them pronouns. This is most clearly stated in a\n    profile that identifies them under their musical moniker Babebee.</i>" Gemini then clarified its position: "<i>Other sources refer to Miya Folick without mentioning their pronouns\n    explicitly, using "she/her" based on the name "Miya," but this is not\n    confirmed by the artist themselves and is therefore less reliable.</i>"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Her Wikipedia entry would beg to differ. It refers to her as "<i>she/her</i>"\n  throughout. And so does Miya (Who\'d also like you know her name is pronounced\n  Meee-yaaa, not Maya.)&nbsp; In an interview she gave only this summer to\n  <i><a href="https://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/I1939600"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Chicago\'s GoPride</span></a></i>\n  she answered a direct question about her pronouns with&nbsp; "<i>...she/her, thank you for asking.</i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I know there are a lot of people who\'d like us to stop caring about pronouns\n  and another bunch who\'d like us to believe Gemini getting it wrong is a\n  conspiracy but actually AI just isn\'t very good, still. That\'s the takeaway.\n  Use it but never, ever trust it. Always verify.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that kind of got us away from the song, which is just gorgeous. And\n  boy, I\'m editorializing a lot today, aren\'t I? We\'ll run out of time for tunes\n  if I go on like this. I\'ll try to be more concise.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;<i>GMFU </i>- Syd</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t have a lot to say about this one, so that should help speed things along. It\'s <i>Syd</i>,\n  late of both <i>Odd Future</i> and <i>The Internet</i>. She was probably the\n  least-scary of the Odd Future collective, although that\'s really not saying\n  much - they were all terrifying. They\'ve all mellowed enormously (Well, by\n  comparison...) and they all make great music. Just goes to show you shouldn\'t\n  be scared of the future.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>No Vacancy</i> - Tiger la Flor</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  I sometimes worry I\'m getting stuck in a rut with these posts, relying on the\n  same, predictable artists to keep pumping out tunes that sound like everything\n  else they\'ve done. And it\'s true but it also has a lot to do with how long\n  I\'ve been doing this now. When you start something, everything in it is new by\n  default, but the longer you keep at it, the more repetitive it gets.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  But then I think, well I wouldn\'t be saying this about my umpteenth post about\n  the same dozen games I\'ve been banging on about for years, would I? So why\n  worry if I come round again and again to the same singers and bands?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, though, if I may be honest, it\'s that I\'ve been too consumed with\n  other things to go virtual crate-digging for a while. I\'m sure there\'ll be\n  some new stuff eventually.

I just clicked through\n  because it had an interesting thumbnail and I was a fair way into it before I\n  started to think "<i>Isn\'t this AI?</i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I mention it because this has some of the same texture to it but the\n  difference is like drinking an ice-cold Coke from the original ribbed glass\n  bottle compared to swiging from a two-tier plastic bottle of supermarket cola that\'s been\n  left in the sun for an hour.

No video for this one. Won\'t bother some people. (Hi, <i>Redbeard</i>!) Also we\'ve had some\n  good videos already. We can afford to give our eyes a rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t know why but I keep thinking <i>Miya Folick</i>\'s an actor with a\n  side-hustle as a pop star, like a lot of them. She\'s not. She\'s a full-time singer-songwriter. She did study\n  acting but I don\'t think she\'s ever done it for a living.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I got that from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miya_Folick"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">her Wikipedia page</span></a>. Just this week I was having a chat with someone at work about AI, warning\n  them to double-check everything, which of course means doing the work yourself\n  so why even bother asking AI to begin with? I mention it because it just\n  occurred to me to I probably ought to check Miya\'s pronouns before I go to\n  print so I ran "<i>Miya Folick pronouns</i>" through Google and the helpful AI\n  summary at the top confidently told me "<i>Miya Folick uses they/them pronouns. This is most clearly stated in a\n    profile that identifies them under their musical moniker Babebee.</i>" Gemini then clarified its position: "<i>Other sources refer to Miya Folick without mentioning their pronouns\n    explicitly, using "she/her" based on the name "Miya," but this is not\n    confirmed by the artist themselves and is therefore less reliable.</i>"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Her Wikipedia entry would beg to differ. It refers to her as "<i>she/her</i>"\n  throughout. And so does Miya (Who\'d also like you know her name is pronounced\n  Meee-yaaa, not Maya.)&nbsp; In an interview she gave only this summer to\n  <i><a href="https://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/I1939600"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Chicago\'s GoPride</span></a></i>\n  she answered a direct question about her pronouns with&nbsp; "<i>...she/her, thank you for asking.</i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I know there are a lot of people who\'d like us to stop caring about pronouns\n  and another bunch who\'d like us to believe Gemini getting it wrong is a\n  conspiracy but actually AI just isn\'t very good, still. That\'s the takeaway.\n  Use it but never, ever trust it. Always verify.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that kind of got us away from the song, which is just gorgeous.

(We live on a busy main road and builders and allied tradesmen can\'t be relied on to keep gates closed.)</p><p>My character, who now has a name: <i>Floradelle</i>. As I suspected, there\'s a plot point where it becomes apparent she has no idea who she is and has to come up with something for people to call her. It\'s one of the most hackneyed of RPG tropes but handled here rather amusingly, I thought. Certainly not done to death, as it often is.</p><p>When I logged out she\'d just dinged Level 6. Not there are any dings when you level up in this game. It\'s barely noticeable, in fact. I do miss the good old dings of yore.</p><p>She\'s finished the opening stage of the main questline, up to the part where the first minor troublemaker is revealed and defeated. While it\'s still very early days, I feel I\'m already in a position to address some of the main criticisms of the game, things that have seen it review-bombed on Steam, although I note it has now risen to the relative glories of "<i>Mixed</i>" from about six thousand reviews, which is at least an improvement on yesterday\'s "<i>Mostly Negative</i>".</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnKlUNGne2gDb4zh2TJaYEpnod5zHCCbE3Q97stTNQly1lVUK03dJZbxkdZEPizFB37z1s55OEZT4Cd4efGkFC-Lf0v-0g7ACnPfZbqzhmpBV-BRrl86uekcEHIFMf2hQnrBg03Kx3yvh4WUTXnMGzzDk3Lz4buGcV7hyphenhypheniYc3zRSNJQEX4jvmaC-08OZ0/s1920/bpmem1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnKlUNGne2gDb4zh2TJaYEpnod5zHCCbE3Q97stTNQly1lVUK03dJZbxkdZEPizFB37z1s55OEZT4Cd4efGkFC-Lf0v-0g7ACnPfZbqzhmpBV-BRrl86uekcEHIFMf2hQnrBg03Kx3yvh4WUTXnMGzzDk3Lz4buGcV7hyphenhypheniYc3zRSNJQEX4jvmaC-08OZ0/w640-h360/bpmem1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Firstly, that "<i>There\'s only one server and it\'s in China</i>" claim. If there\'s really only one server, it must be a hell of a big one because as I type this, more than fifty thousand people are <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3681810/charts/">playing the game on </a></span><i><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3681810/charts/">Steam</a></span> </i>and Steam isn\'t the only place you can play it. Peak concurrency on Steam is over 90k, too, so I\'m assuming what people mean is that all the available servers are in China, not that there\'s really just one of them.</p><p>That said, at no point do you have to choose a server, so it\'s a bit of a moot point. Server cluster or single server, it\'s all the same if the tech is up to it.&nbsp;</p><p>The issue in any case isn\'t over whether there\'s one superginormous megaserver or a farm of linked smaller servers pretending to be one. It\'s about ping, latency and playability.</p><p>And they\'re all fine. From here in the UK, anyway. I experienced absolutely no lag whatsoever at any point, no delayed animations, no rubber-banding, no slow responses to any kind of input. I didn\'t check my ping but my play experience was indistinguishable from any MMORPG I play on EU or US servers. And frankly it was a lot better than some. On this evidence <i>Standing Stone</i> would do well to move their servers to China. (Yes, I know that\'s not actually the problem there.)</p><p>I did lose contact with the server once but that happens to me with many games. I suspect it has a lot more to do with the&nbsp;thirty year-old<i>&nbsp;</i>fiber optic cabling coming into the house than anything at the other end. And anyway, connection was re-established in moments and everything continued as before.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQLm0c5QnKyAFgjztGXmJq0MqgZPz8vCGCuIpDmqSUbmC61LDZ9uhuRmTobtzaA0_YbI4_WeQ9jhU7poRNc8tiuUcNWABMaVjKeLwXcWkkEOoboqTOhhVee2GlhV0UFEbSf1G_DdchTrNGso5FbeZ1pg9ZvtEbO35-4znDEhyphenhyphenubB8HyG1w4RvHD1_aODk/s1920/bpfs1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQLm0c5QnKyAFgjztGXmJq0MqgZPz8vCGCuIpDmqSUbmC61LDZ9uhuRmTobtzaA0_YbI4_WeQ9jhU7poRNc8tiuUcNWABMaVjKeLwXcWkkEOoboqTOhhVee2GlhV0UFEbSf1G_DdchTrNGso5FbeZ1pg9ZvtEbO35-4znDEhyphenhyphenubB8HyG1w4RvHD1_aODk/w640-h360/bpfs1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Next, auto-battling. What are people complaining about? Yes, it exists but it\'s off by default. Are they switching it on just so they can complain about it? (I imagine that\'s exactly what\'s happening.)</p><p>I\'ve been reading about auto-battle in mobile ports for ages but so far I can\'t remember playing any that had it. I wish they did. I\'d love to be able to let the game deal with all those open-world Tacet Discords in <i>Wuthering Waves</i>, for example.</p><p>I was positively excited to try the feature out in <i>BP:SR</i>.&nbsp; When I arrived at my first combat moment in the game, something that\'s a surprisingly long time coming, I waited to see what would happen. Nothing did. I had to fight the damn mob myself like some kind of peasant!</p><p>After it was dead, I ferreted around in the settings to find the keybind (It\'s "<i>H</i>".) and toggled auto-battling on. From then until when I logged out, I happily let the game do my work for me as I cackled with glee. You do have to remember to toggle it off again when you\'re done or else your character will just charge from mob to mob in a never-ending killing spree but I even liked that part. It made me feel like I had some agency, without needing to make an effort, which is pretty much perfect gameplay from my perspective.</p><p>I doubt auto-battling is going to cut it in whatever passes for difficult group content in this game but since I\'m extremely unlikely ever to engage in any of that, why would I care? What I can say is that not having to do much of my own button-pressing as I run around doing pointless tasks for lazy NPCs is likely to lead to me playing the game for longer. It\'s automating out the bit of the game I look forward to the least so why would I complain?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj65j10wJFCZD1RRmHGYo5alN3BADmjkDpbtYYKuwQIycfLMbC3WB6nbSbs-KMAYN2fbq4CR0sFP8NBvZYfouvA1lZELbSnvj5GeJqOPiJzBRF72rMUStUp4A69S2Er33Qdk5rvDMOVWgIPEuWraUT8k8fcQHPq8UqgP3T7_4az_lBP69uAmYmHRBh3gQs/s1920/bpai1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj65j10wJFCZD1RRmHGYo5alN3BADmjkDpbtYYKuwQIycfLMbC3WB6nbSbs-KMAYN2fbq4CR0sFP8NBvZYfouvA1lZELbSnvj5GeJqOPiJzBRF72rMUStUp4A69S2Er33Qdk5rvDMOVWgIPEuWraUT8k8fcQHPq8UqgP3T7_4az_lBP69uAmYmHRBh3gQs/w640-h360/bpai1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>I will be using both auto-battling and auto-pathing (Which I forgot was in the game until I wrote this paragraph and now wish I\'d been using all along.) whenever I feel like it with no shame whatsoever. Conversely, if I\'m in the mood to do my own running and fighting, as I sometimes am, I\'ll do them. This game gives me the choice and I cannot for the life of me see why anyone would claim that\'s a Bad Thing, let alone rant about it in a review. (Erm... didn\'t you just do exactly that yourself, only in reverse?)</p><p>Speaking of doing dumb quests for dumb NPCs, that\'s another of the sticks being used to beat the game. When I was skimming the Steam reviews yesterday I saw several negative comments about how boring the quests were and how the cut scenes weren\'t worth watching. Related complaints involved poor translations and completely untranslated voice acting.</p><p>Based on my experience so far (Which is about four or five times longer than that of many of the people making those comments, many of whom had spent barely half an hour in the game.) only one of those observations is true. There is no English dub for the Chinese voice acting.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s not at all unusual in imported MMORPGs and I\'m in two minds about whether it\'s a problem or not. Voice acting is a bit of a double-edged sword in that, when done well, it does add hugely to both immersion and storytelling, but when done badly (Or even averagely.) it\'s often more annoying than not having it at all.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiB7hB8PwwkwiWaBnFy5UcXls1sCgt-JxlVsI1YoX6PHBsXHdq_qYzbpReKJh3-fq8k_-pBFpIqMzcqCsWMtopNr1QjW1hYKWXM2dyJ8TSUONFDOwqnEoPAxqJiRRoXE-xKhN9FVelz1FDo4bZ5OgFzECZvFHQ9dd4DH5vfMnxIcN-VRpZ4c1sW0XGAcps/s1043/bpstreet1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiB7hB8PwwkwiWaBnFy5UcXls1sCgt-JxlVsI1YoX6PHBsXHdq_qYzbpReKJh3-fq8k_-pBFpIqMzcqCsWMtopNr1QjW1hYKWXM2dyJ8TSUONFDOwqnEoPAxqJiRRoXE-xKhN9FVelz1FDo4bZ5OgFzECZvFHQ9dd4DH5vfMnxIcN-VRpZ4c1sW0XGAcps/w400-h388/bpstreet1.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>And even good voice acting slows everything down. I can read the text in maybe a quarter of the time it takes to listen to it. Cutting actors off mid-speech is jarring and anyway, if the acting is good, I feel I ought to keep it on and appreciate it, but even then I\'m often twitching to get on with things.&nbsp;<p></p><p>Only when the writing and the voice acting are both well above average, as for example in <i>Wuthering Waves</i>, does it feel like time well-spent to pay them each full attention. And as I\'ve said numerous times, that in itself is enervating.&nbsp;</p><p>Probably the main reason I play Wuthering Waves so infrequently is because the writing and voice acting are too good for what I want from that kind of video game. It\'s a level of quality that actually puts me off engaging with it because of the commitment it demands. I mean, if I wanted to watch a pretty good movie, I\'d do that instead.</p><p>For that reason, I was actively pleased to be able to go into the settings for BP:SR and switch NPC voices off. I couldn\'t understand them and the audio was carrying on long after I\'d finished reading the text, so it seemed like the obvious choice. I\'d rate the lack of English voices as at worst a neutral factor but probably a positive for the game as a whole. I kind of hope they never add them although by my own previous argument I guess I have to accept that it would be better to have the option.</p><p>How about the text, though? <i>Is </i>it badly translated? And those quests. <i>Are </i>they boring? The cut scenes, too. Is the only sensible choice to skip them?</p><p>No, no and no.&nbsp;</p><p>The dialog is well-translated, albeit with that odd lilt that\'s become so very familiar. It\'s idiomatic and grammatically correct and yet it still somehow has a slight off-kilter feel to it. And I like that. It\'s like hearing someone speak excellent English, only with a very slight, pleasant accent. What\'s the problem?</p><p>As for content, the quests are no more boring than any other quest in any other game of this stripe and considerably less boring than many.

(We live on a busy main road and builders and allied tradesmen can\'t be relied on to keep gates closed.)</p><p>My character, who now has a name: <i>Floradelle</i>. As I suspected, there\'s a plot point where it becomes apparent she has no idea who she is and has to come up with something for people to call her. It\'s one of the most hackneyed of RPG tropes but handled here rather amusingly, I thought. Certainly not done to death, as it often is.</p><p>When I logged out she\'d just dinged Level 6. Not there are any dings when you level up in this game. It\'s barely noticeable, in fact. I do miss the good old dings of yore.</p><p>She\'s finished the opening stage of the main questline, up to the part where the first minor troublemaker is revealed and defeated. While it\'s still very early days, I feel I\'m already in a position to address some of the main criticisms of the game, things that have seen it review-bombed on Steam, although I note it has now risen to the relative glories of "<i>Mixed</i>" from about six thousand reviews, which is at least an improvement on yesterday\'s "<i>Mostly Negative</i>".</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnKlUNGne2gDb4zh2TJaYEpnod5zHCCbE3Q97stTNQly1lVUK03dJZbxkdZEPizFB37z1s55OEZT4Cd4efGkFC-Lf0v-0g7ACnPfZbqzhmpBV-BRrl86uekcEHIFMf2hQnrBg03Kx3yvh4WUTXnMGzzDk3Lz4buGcV7hyphenhypheniYc3zRSNJQEX4jvmaC-08OZ0/s1920/bpmem1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnKlUNGne2gDb4zh2TJaYEpnod5zHCCbE3Q97stTNQly1lVUK03dJZbxkdZEPizFB37z1s55OEZT4Cd4efGkFC-Lf0v-0g7ACnPfZbqzhmpBV-BRrl86uekcEHIFMf2hQnrBg03Kx3yvh4WUTXnMGzzDk3Lz4buGcV7hyphenhypheniYc3zRSNJQEX4jvmaC-08OZ0/w640-h360/bpmem1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Firstly, that "<i>There\'s only one server and it\'s in China</i>" claim. If there\'s really only one server, it must be a hell of a big one because as I type this, more than fifty thousand people are <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3681810/charts/">playing the game on </a></span><i><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3681810/charts/">Steam</a></span> </i>and Steam isn\'t the only place you can play it. Peak concurrency on Steam is over 90k, too, so I\'m assuming what people mean is that all the available servers are in China, not that there\'s really just one of them.</p><p>That said, at no point do you have to choose a server, so it\'s a bit of a moot point. Server cluster or single server, it\'s all the same if the tech is up to it.&nbsp;</p><p>The issue in any case isn\'t over whether there\'s one superginormous megaserver or a farm of linked smaller servers pretending to be one. It\'s about ping, latency and playability.</p><p>And they\'re all fine. From here in the UK, anyway. I experienced absolutely no lag whatsoever at any point, no delayed animations, no rubber-banding, no slow responses to any kind of input. I didn\'t check my ping but my play experience was indistinguishable from any MMORPG I play on EU or US servers. And frankly it was a lot better than some. On this evidence <i>Standing Stone</i> would do well to move their servers to China. (Yes, I know that\'s not actually the problem there.)</p><p>I did lose contact with the server once but that happens to me with many games. I suspect it has a lot more to do with the&nbsp;thirty year-old<i>&nbsp;</i>fiber optic cabling coming into the house than anything at the other end. And anyway, connection was re-established in moments and everything continued as before.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQLm0c5QnKyAFgjztGXmJq0MqgZPz8vCGCuIpDmqSUbmC61LDZ9uhuRmTobtzaA0_YbI4_WeQ9jhU7poRNc8tiuUcNWABMaVjKeLwXcWkkEOoboqTOhhVee2GlhV0UFEbSf1G_DdchTrNGso5FbeZ1pg9ZvtEbO35-4znDEhyphenhyphenubB8HyG1w4RvHD1_aODk/s1920/bpfs1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQLm0c5QnKyAFgjztGXmJq0MqgZPz8vCGCuIpDmqSUbmC61LDZ9uhuRmTobtzaA0_YbI4_WeQ9jhU7poRNc8tiuUcNWABMaVjKeLwXcWkkEOoboqTOhhVee2GlhV0UFEbSf1G_DdchTrNGso5FbeZ1pg9ZvtEbO35-4znDEhyphenhyphenubB8HyG1w4RvHD1_aODk/w640-h360/bpfs1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Next, auto-battling. What are people complaining about? Yes, it exists but it\'s off by default. Are they switching it on just so they can complain about it? (I imagine that\'s exactly what\'s happening.)</p><p>I\'ve been reading about auto-battle in mobile ports for ages but so far I can\'t remember playing any that had it. I wish they did. I\'d love to be able to let the game deal with all those open-world Tacet Discords in <i>Wuthering Waves</i>, for example.</p><p>I was positively excited to try the feature out in <i>BP:SR</i>.&nbsp; When I arrived at my first combat moment in the game, something that\'s a surprisingly long time coming, I waited to see what would happen. Nothing did. I had to fight the damn mob myself like some kind of peasant!</p><p>After it was dead, I ferreted around in the settings to find the keybind (It\'s "<i>H</i>".) and toggled auto-battling on. From then until when I logged out, I happily let the game do my work for me as I cackled with glee. You do have to remember to toggle it off again when you\'re done or else your character will just charge from mob to mob in a never-ending killing spree but I even liked that part. It made me feel like I had some agency, without needing to make an effort, which is pretty much perfect gameplay from my perspective.</p><p>I doubt auto-battling is going to cut it in whatever passes for difficult group content in this game but since I\'m extremely unlikely ever to engage in any of that, why would I care? What I can say is that not having to do much of my own button-pressing as I run around doing pointless tasks for lazy NPCs is likely to lead to me playing the game for longer. It\'s automating out the bit of the game I look forward to the least so why would I complain?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj65j10wJFCZD1RRmHGYo5alN3BADmjkDpbtYYKuwQIycfLMbC3WB6nbSbs-KMAYN2fbq4CR0sFP8NBvZYfouvA1lZELbSnvj5GeJqOPiJzBRF72rMUStUp4A69S2Er33Qdk5rvDMOVWgIPEuWraUT8k8fcQHPq8UqgP3T7_4az_lBP69uAmYmHRBh3gQs/s1920/bpai1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj65j10wJFCZD1RRmHGYo5alN3BADmjkDpbtYYKuwQIycfLMbC3WB6nbSbs-KMAYN2fbq4CR0sFP8NBvZYfouvA1lZELbSnvj5GeJqOPiJzBRF72rMUStUp4A69S2Er33Qdk5rvDMOVWgIPEuWraUT8k8fcQHPq8UqgP3T7_4az_lBP69uAmYmHRBh3gQs/w640-h360/bpai1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>I will be using both auto-battling and auto-pathing (Which I forgot was in the game until I wrote this paragraph and now wish I\'d been using all along.) whenever I feel like it with no shame whatsoever. Conversely, if I\'m in the mood to do my own running and fighting, as I sometimes am, I\'ll do them. This game gives me the choice and I cannot for the life of me see why anyone would claim that\'s a Bad Thing, let alone rant about it in a review. (Erm... didn\'t you just do exactly that yourself, only in reverse?)</p><p>Speaking of doing dumb quests for dumb NPCs, that\'s another of the sticks being used to beat the game. When I was skimming the Steam reviews yesterday I saw several negative comments about how boring the quests were and how the cut scenes weren\'t worth watching. Related complaints involved poor translations and completely untranslated voice acting.</p><p>Based on my experience so far (Which is about four or five times longer than that of many of the people making those comments, many of whom had spent barely half an hour in the game.) only one of those observations is true. There is no English dub for the Chinese voice acting.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s not at all unusual in imported MMORPGs and I\'m in two minds about whether it\'s a problem or not. Voice acting is a bit of a double-edged sword in that, when done well, it does add hugely to both immersion and storytelling, but when done badly (Or even averagely.) it\'s often more annoying than not having it at all.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiB7hB8PwwkwiWaBnFy5UcXls1sCgt-JxlVsI1YoX6PHBsXHdq_qYzbpReKJh3-fq8k_-pBFpIqMzcqCsWMtopNr1QjW1hYKWXM2dyJ8TSUONFDOwqnEoPAxqJiRRoXE-xKhN9FVelz1FDo4bZ5OgFzECZvFHQ9dd4DH5vfMnxIcN-VRpZ4c1sW0XGAcps/s1043/bpstreet1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiB7hB8PwwkwiWaBnFy5UcXls1sCgt-JxlVsI1YoX6PHBsXHdq_qYzbpReKJh3-fq8k_-pBFpIqMzcqCsWMtopNr1QjW1hYKWXM2dyJ8TSUONFDOwqnEoPAxqJiRRoXE-xKhN9FVelz1FDo4bZ5OgFzECZvFHQ9dd4DH5vfMnxIcN-VRpZ4c1sW0XGAcps/w400-h388/bpstreet1.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>And even good voice acting slows everything down. I can read the text in maybe a quarter of the time it takes to listen to it. Cutting actors off mid-speech is jarring and anyway, if the acting is good, I feel I ought to keep it on and appreciate it, but even then I\'m often twitching to get on with things.&nbsp;<p></p><p>Only when the writing and the voice acting are both well above average, as for example in <i>Wuthering Waves</i>, does it feel like time well-spent to pay them each full attention. And as I\'ve said numerous times, that in itself is enervating.&nbsp;</p><p>Probably the main reason I play Wuthering Waves so infrequently is because the writing and voice acting are too good for what I want from that kind of video game. It\'s a level of quality that actually puts me off engaging with it because of the commitment it demands. I mean, if I wanted to watch a pretty good movie, I\'d do that instead.</p><p>For that reason, I was actively pleased to be able to go into the settings for BP:SR and switch NPC voices off. I couldn\'t understand them and the audio was carrying on long after I\'d finished reading the text, so it seemed like the obvious choice. I\'d rate the lack of English voices as at worst a neutral factor but probably a positive for the game as a whole. I kind of hope they never add them although by my own previous argument I guess I have to accept that it would be better to have the option.</p><p>How about the text, though? <i>Is </i>it badly translated? And those quests. <i>Are </i>they boring? The cut scenes, too. Is the only sensible choice to skip them?</p><p>No, no and no.&nbsp;</p><p>The dialog is well-translated, albeit with that odd lilt that\'s become so very familiar. It\'s idiomatic and grammatically correct and yet it still somehow has a slight off-kilter feel to it. And I like that. It\'s like hearing someone speak excellent English, only with a very slight, pleasant accent. What\'s the problem?</p><p>As for content, the quests are no more boring than any other quest in any other game of this stripe and considerably less boring than many. So far it\'s all been very standard stuff, although starting with the equivalent of half a dozen quests of the type you\'d normally find in an in-game holiday is a brave opening move.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the first half-hour of the game proper <i>is </i>a holiday event, to all intents and purposes.

I\'ve only ever mentioned it two or three times here on the blog and not at all for a couple of years.&nbsp;</p><p>The most interested in it I ever sounded was <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2022/12/you-watch-too-much-tv-you-play-too-many.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">at the back end of 2022</span></a>, when it had been picked up by <i>Amazon Games </i>as the global publisher. At the time, I said I hadn\'t been planning on playing it, even though I knew there was a lot of hype around the title, but since I had an Amazon Games account already set up, it seemed it might be worth taking a look when it arrived.</p><p>It never did arrive, of course. Not through Amazon, anyway. That all fell through for reasons I\'m not sure I knew even while it was happening and certainly don\'t remember now. The game was released in Japan but didn\'t last long there, closing at the beginning of this year.</p><p>And that seemed to be the end of it.

It\'s something of a relief just to pick from a menu and even then I found myself trying to make tiny adjustments that are never going to have any impact on my experience when I start playing the game proper.</p><p>I was in character creation for close on half an hour, something I can be reasonably sure of by my Steam played time of 35 minutes. The only other thing I did was watch the very short opening cut scene, then read a short note and put on my starting gear in the room where my character woke up after drowning or whatever it was that happened to her.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr1HLx7T7YQwPmILTzrVOzRHL-L9trm8TMJCEBBkUyvh4V07K9e1ut5hKUNDMfhT5nL7ED1PX8bYQEKmwiifzMRpTcmt1rIFQp_MYVGqA_brrtbHxu79GCWQZCyDL3n5TvLKBVMrlzt08ABobM3g3sXTPFE9hpHaAqZjMtgKjEabcVbvpgqR1iUddy7ws/s560/bpdog1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr1HLx7T7YQwPmILTzrVOzRHL-L9trm8TMJCEBBkUyvh4V07K9e1ut5hKUNDMfhT5nL7ED1PX8bYQEKmwiifzMRpTcmt1rIFQp_MYVGqA_brrtbHxu79GCWQZCyDL3n5TvLKBVMrlzt08ABobM3g3sXTPFE9hpHaAqZjMtgKjEabcVbvpgqR1iUddy7ws/w353-h400/bpdog1.jpg" width="353" /></a></div>Honestly, I don\'t know what happened. I wasn\'t paying attention because Mrs Bhagpuss came in in the middle of the cut scene and asked me a question and I turned round to answer her and neither saw nor heard what happened next, after my character dived down deep into the ocean.&nbsp;When I looked back at the screen, she was in a room somewhere.&nbsp;<p></p><p>All of that, including what I did when I got to the room, can\'t have taken much over five minutes, so the rest has to have been making the character. It didn\'t feel anything like that long, though, which is a strong point in favor of both the tools and the character design.</p><p>Oh, and I opened the claim window and got some freebies for pre-registering, which I never did, so I assume everyone gets them. One was a dog you can ride on. looking forward to trying that out.&nbsp;</p><p>Going back to the look of the thing, the character models certainly do scream "<i>anime</i>". There\'s no doubt about that. I didn\'t take any of them, but there are plenty of options to have the huge anime-style eyes and the many hair-styles all have that flick-away look that\'s so familiar. You even get to choose what your teeth look like, which I think may be a first for me.</p><p>Hair and eyes are always the two I spend most time on. There are a whole load of pupil choices, which for once actually look reasonable. That took me a while.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting the hair right took longer. You can just take a preset hairstyle but again you can mix and match from "<i>Front</i>", "<i>Back</i>" and "<i>Crown</i>" to get something a little less generic. I was curious about the Crown option. It turns out to be one or two strands of flyaway hair that stick up or out and wave about in the breeze. I toyed with the idea but I suspect it would become quite annoying after the novelty wore off so I settled for the neat and tidy look.&nbsp;</p><p>I have to keep calling her "<i>my character</i>" because one oddity of the process was that at no point did I get a chance to give her a name. I have come across that in other games. It usually means there\'s some point early on, where naming your character becomes a storyline choice, like when some official asks you to identify yourself or you have to sign some sort of document. We\'ll see if that happens next time I play.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5AdVye-zINhk4RBG40zFRtutJ2MbsMDCHJKN6xhx7-KoO17QAoQFLQMm84Z2qZUzCmb3-UU4pQPzg-WfzQUKOzBVRidln4X-93Si2GYRtqXzHJ2qL3KwWpl8_XGIJ1Ak5-bGYFbwyrCyusfI3nKfmq5lqyFlMibDvTLxgg_3qiTJ4D1esBbHPjY-0WP4/s1079/bproom1.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5AdVye-zINhk4RBG40zFRtutJ2MbsMDCHJKN6xhx7-KoO17QAoQFLQMm84Z2qZUzCmb3-UU4pQPzg-WfzQUKOzBVRidln4X-93Si2GYRtqXzHJ2qL3KwWpl8_XGIJ1Ak5-bGYFbwyrCyusfI3nKfmq5lqyFlMibDvTLxgg_3qiTJ4D1esBbHPjY-0WP4/w325-h400/bproom1.jpg" width="325" /></a></div>Which is also when I\'ll find out if the game has any stickiness I guess. I\'m hoping it may be at least as sticky as<i> Crystal of Atlan</i>, which I am theoretically, although not actually, still playing. I did get to about Level 50 or so in that one, which isn\'t nothing.<p></p><p>The last thing I did before the game dumped me into the opening cut scene was pick a class. There were quite a few to choose from. Maybe ten? I picked the ranged fighter that uses a bow and has a pet that fights for her because I always pick that one. And almost always regret it. The fighter with the giant sword is always more fun. I\'ll never learn.</p><p>All the classes get a difficulty rating. Mine was two stars out of five, so towards the easy end but not the easiest. That was the aforementioned fighter with the big sword. I\'m hopeful that the much-maligned auto-combat option will remove any need for skill on my part anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So far, BP:SR is being torn apart on Steam, with a "<i>Mosly Negative</i>" rating from almost two and a half thousand reviews. I had a quick skim and most of the disses I read seemed to be complaining about things I\'m quite keen on, like that auto combat and also auto pathing, or that I don\'t care about at all, like it being a mobile port, or that I\'m expecting not to affect me much, like there being no EU or US servers.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the "<i>boring dialog</i>" and dull quests, I\'ll make my own mind up on those. It is noticeable that there are a lot of quite sensible, positive reviews, while the negative ones mostly seem to be from people wishing they were playing a different game altogether. I wonder why people bother to download titles they must know they aren\'t going to enjoy. Seems like a waste of time to me</p><p>And speaking of time, that\'s all I have for this evening, so my first impressions are going to have to end there. For now. There will be more.

The only other thing I did was watch the very short opening cut scene, then read a short note and put on my starting gear in the room where my character woke up after drowning or whatever it was that happened to her.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr1HLx7T7YQwPmILTzrVOzRHL-L9trm8TMJCEBBkUyvh4V07K9e1ut5hKUNDMfhT5nL7ED1PX8bYQEKmwiifzMRpTcmt1rIFQp_MYVGqA_brrtbHxu79GCWQZCyDL3n5TvLKBVMrlzt08ABobM3g3sXTPFE9hpHaAqZjMtgKjEabcVbvpgqR1iUddy7ws/s560/bpdog1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr1HLx7T7YQwPmILTzrVOzRHL-L9trm8TMJCEBBkUyvh4V07K9e1ut5hKUNDMfhT5nL7ED1PX8bYQEKmwiifzMRpTcmt1rIFQp_MYVGqA_brrtbHxu79GCWQZCyDL3n5TvLKBVMrlzt08ABobM3g3sXTPFE9hpHaAqZjMtgKjEabcVbvpgqR1iUddy7ws/w353-h400/bpdog1.jpg" width="353" /></a></div>Honestly, I don\'t know what happened. I wasn\'t paying attention because Mrs Bhagpuss came in in the middle of the cut scene and asked me a question and I turned round to answer her and neither saw nor heard what happened next, after my character dived down deep into the ocean.&nbsp;When I looked back at the screen, she was in a room somewhere.&nbsp;<p></p><p>All of that, including what I did when I got to the room, can\'t have taken much over five minutes, so the rest has to have been making the character. It didn\'t feel anything like that long, though, which is a strong point in favor of both the tools and the character design.</p><p>Oh, and I opened the claim window and got some freebies for pre-registering, which I never did, so I assume everyone gets them. One was a dog you can ride on. looking forward to trying that out.&nbsp;</p><p>Going back to the look of the thing, the character models certainly do scream "<i>anime</i>". There\'s no doubt about that. I didn\'t take any of them, but there are plenty of options to have the huge anime-style eyes and the many hair-styles all have that flick-away look that\'s so familiar. You even get to choose what your teeth look like, which I think may be a first for me.</p><p>Hair and eyes are always the two I spend most time on. There are a whole load of pupil choices, which for once actually look reasonable. That took me a while.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting the hair right took longer. You can just take a preset hairstyle but again you can mix and match from "<i>Front</i>", "<i>Back</i>" and "<i>Crown</i>" to get something a little less generic. I was curious about the Crown option. It turns out to be one or two strands of flyaway hair that stick up or out and wave about in the breeze. I toyed with the idea but I suspect it would become quite annoying after the novelty wore off so I settled for the neat and tidy look.&nbsp;</p><p>I have to keep calling her "<i>my character</i>" because one oddity of the process was that at no point did I get a chance to give her a name. I have come across that in other games. It usually means there\'s some point early on, where naming your character becomes a storyline choice, like when some official asks you to identify yourself or you have to sign some sort of document. We\'ll see if that happens next time I play.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5AdVye-zINhk4RBG40zFRtutJ2MbsMDCHJKN6xhx7-KoO17QAoQFLQMm84Z2qZUzCmb3-UU4pQPzg-WfzQUKOzBVRidln4X-93Si2GYRtqXzHJ2qL3KwWpl8_XGIJ1Ak5-bGYFbwyrCyusfI3nKfmq5lqyFlMibDvTLxgg_3qiTJ4D1esBbHPjY-0WP4/s1079/bproom1.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5AdVye-zINhk4RBG40zFRtutJ2MbsMDCHJKN6xhx7-KoO17QAoQFLQMm84Z2qZUzCmb3-UU4pQPzg-WfzQUKOzBVRidln4X-93Si2GYRtqXzHJ2qL3KwWpl8_XGIJ1Ak5-bGYFbwyrCyusfI3nKfmq5lqyFlMibDvTLxgg_3qiTJ4D1esBbHPjY-0WP4/w325-h400/bproom1.jpg" width="325" /></a></div>Which is also when I\'ll find out if the game has any stickiness I guess. I\'m hoping it may be at least as sticky as<i> Crystal of Atlan</i>, which I am theoretically, although not actually, still playing. I did get to about Level 50 or so in that one, which isn\'t nothing.<p></p><p>The last thing I did before the game dumped me into the opening cut scene was pick a class. There were quite a few to choose from. Maybe ten? I picked the ranged fighter that uses a bow and has a pet that fights for her because I always pick that one. And almost always regret it. The fighter with the giant sword is always more fun. I\'ll never learn.</p><p>All the classes get a difficulty rating. Mine was two stars out of five, so towards the easy end but not the easiest. That was the aforementioned fighter with the big sword. I\'m hopeful that the much-maligned auto-combat option will remove any need for skill on my part anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So far, BP:SR is being torn apart on Steam, with a "<i>Mosly Negative</i>" rating from almost two and a half thousand reviews. I had a quick skim and most of the disses I read seemed to be complaining about things I\'m quite keen on, like that auto combat and also auto pathing, or that I don\'t care about at all, like it being a mobile port, or that I\'m expecting not to affect me much, like there being no EU or US servers.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the "<i>boring dialog</i>" and dull quests, I\'ll make my own mind up on those. It is noticeable that there are a lot of quite sensible, positive reviews, while the negative ones mostly seem to be from people wishing they were playing a different game altogether. I wonder why people bother to download titles they must know they aren\'t going to enjoy. Seems like a waste of time to me</p><p>And speaking of time, that\'s all I have for this evening, so my first impressions are going to have to end there. For now. There will be more. I guarantee it.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/blue-protocol-star-resonance-extremely.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/blue-protocol-star-resonance-extremely.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKlja3Q6Qs55-mEETWUD_HeXRi9lKTIySFKUjQ2roo516oGSE2CnUmkENWwhn1FLTLXWAYL8Ctu4AysxfBnT9cHMfrqbmLHKTR3j8ZqVxVu-1CKQuK7uJ_ViG8qiyjZ2sjjPzt18TBy20UNo0pc8URb8Rr7rSTPMCbeS7PNa2MxwNtN2ooTEHh5zNBSUg/s72-w640-h358-c/bpcs1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '2'}

It carries on it that vein for a while but I won\'t quote the whole thing. It\'s all there if you follow the link.</p><p>I have to say it doesn\'t inspire much excitement in me. The reverse, if anything. It always seems to me that these extra-planar jaunts take the game away from its well-established foundation in high fantasy.&nbsp;That said, the Void is an extremely well-established part of <i>EQ </i>lore, going all the way back to the elder game\'s initial phase, where <i>Shadowed Men </i>were a much-feared presence across the Commonlands and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>EQII\'s previous flirtations with the Void include some things I\'ve really enjoyed, too. <i>The Shadow Odyssey</i>&nbsp;featured a number of Void-related instances, at least one of which occupied many happy hours as I farmed the final boss for what was, at that time, a very decent chunk of change.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the best dungeons in the whole game, <i>The Obelisk of Lost Souls</i>, in the game since launch, is closely related to the Void and <i>Rivervale </i>has been over-run with invaders from that mysterious plane of existence since EQII began (Better them than halflings!) so I guess it may be about time we went to see where the pesky creatures come from.</p><p>There\'s not a whole lot more information available in the Letter, other than the names of what sound like a couple of open-world zones, <i>Yon Gorroth </i>and the <i>Unknown</i>. Exactly how many zones, instances or other explorable areas might be included has yet to be revealed but we do know the game is going to be getting yet another difficulty tier with the addition of <i>Untold Heroics</i>.</p><p>Commenters in <a href="https://forums.everquest2.com/index.php?threads/producer%E2%80%99s-letter-october-2025.10413/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the thread</span></a> following the Producer\'s Letter on the Forums wasted no time in comparing UHs to <i>World of Warcraft\'</i>s Mythic Dungeons, promptly deciding that meant they wanted nothing to do with them. Since I already have nothing to do with the existing Heroics I and II, it\'s all a bit of a non-issue for me, just so long as we\'ll be getting the regular Solo versions of whatever dungeons the expansion brings.</p><p>There will also be a new batch of Public Quests. I really like PQs although it is quite true, as one disgruntled commenter points out, that in three months no-one will be doing them. That does tend to be the way it goes but honestly you could say that about most content in EQII and a good deal of content in just about every MMORPG, at least the ones that rely on vertical progression to keep people motivated. If we ruled out every new addition to the game on the grounds no-one would be using it in three months, we\'d have barely any new content at all.</p><p>Finally, as everyone already must have known, the level cap will go up by five to 135. Happens every second expansion. If nothing else, that will make revisiting some of the only slightly out-of-date content from recent expansions and GUs a lot more fun, for me at least, although the merciless Resolve escalator means there\'s not a lot of point, other than to see stuff I haven\'t seen yet.</p><p>Pre-orders open up in a week, on 14 October, which is also when the Beta for the expansion begins. Pre-ordering always gets you a beta invite, which I never use because it\'s enough effort going through the whole thing once or maybe two or three times when there\'s a cap increase and I have alts to level. I certainly don\'t want to be doing it when everything\'s buggy and I\'m playing a character I\'ll never see again.</p><p>Anyway, that\'s what we know so far. Oh, and the Arch-Villain of the piece is called <i>The Consumer</i>, which I imagine is supposed to make me think of some towering, all-devouring monster with teeth the size of cavalry sabers, but which actually gives me a mental image of someone in a housecoat, sitting on a sofa with the TV blaring as they hunch over a laptop, ordering lampshades and throw-pillows from <i>Amazon</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>About the only other thing I have to say about Rage of Cthurath at this stage is that I\'m not entirely looking forward to staring at purple and orange fungus for the next year.

It carries on it that vein for a while but I won\'t quote the whole thing. It\'s all there if you follow the link.</p><p>I have to say it doesn\'t inspire much excitement in me. The reverse, if anything. It always seems to me that these extra-planar jaunts take the game away from its well-established foundation in high fantasy.&nbsp;That said, the Void is an extremely well-established part of <i>EQ </i>lore, going all the way back to the elder game\'s initial phase, where <i>Shadowed Men </i>were a much-feared presence across the Commonlands and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>EQII\'s previous flirtations with the Void include some things I\'ve really enjoyed, too. <i>The Shadow Odyssey</i>&nbsp;featured a number of Void-related instances, at least one of which occupied many happy hours as I farmed the final boss for what was, at that time, a very decent chunk of change.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the best dungeons in the whole game, <i>The Obelisk of Lost Souls</i>, in the game since launch, is closely related to the Void and <i>Rivervale </i>has been over-run with invaders from that mysterious plane of existence since EQII began (Better them than halflings!) so I guess it may be about time we went to see where the pesky creatures come from.</p><p>There\'s not a whole lot more information available in the Letter, other than the names of what sound like a couple of open-world zones, <i>Yon Gorroth </i>and the <i>Unknown</i>. Exactly how many zones, instances or other explorable areas might be included has yet to be revealed but we do know the game is going to be getting yet another difficulty tier with the addition of <i>Untold Heroics</i>.</p><p>Commenters in <a href="https://forums.everquest2.com/index.php?threads/producer%E2%80%99s-letter-october-2025.10413/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the thread</span></a> following the Producer\'s Letter on the Forums wasted no time in comparing UHs to <i>World of Warcraft\'</i>s Mythic Dungeons, promptly deciding that meant they wanted nothing to do with them. Since I already have nothing to do with the existing Heroics I and II, it\'s all a bit of a non-issue for me, just so long as we\'ll be getting the regular Solo versions of whatever dungeons the expansion brings.</p><p>There will also be a new batch of Public Quests. I really like PQs although it is quite true, as one disgruntled commenter points out, that in three months no-one will be doing them. That does tend to be the way it goes but honestly you could say that about most content in EQII and a good deal of content in just about every MMORPG, at least the ones that rely on vertical progression to keep people motivated. If we ruled out every new addition to the game on the grounds no-one would be using it in three months, we\'d have barely any new content at all.</p><p>Finally, as everyone already must have known, the level cap will go up by five to 135. Happens every second expansion. If nothing else, that will make revisiting some of the only slightly out-of-date content from recent expansions and GUs a lot more fun, for me at least, although the merciless Resolve escalator means there\'s not a lot of point, other than to see stuff I haven\'t seen yet.</p><p>Pre-orders open up in a week, on 14 October, which is also when the Beta for the expansion begins. Pre-ordering always gets you a beta invite, which I never use because it\'s enough effort going through the whole thing once or maybe two or three times when there\'s a cap increase and I have alts to level. I certainly don\'t want to be doing it when everything\'s buggy and I\'m playing a character I\'ll never see again.</p><p>Anyway, that\'s what we know so far. Oh, and the Arch-Villain of the piece is called <i>The Consumer</i>, which I imagine is supposed to make me think of some towering, all-devouring monster with teeth the size of cavalry sabers, but which actually gives me a mental image of someone in a housecoat, sitting on a sofa with the TV blaring as they hunch over a laptop, ordering lampshades and throw-pillows from <i>Amazon</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>About the only other thing I have to say about Rage of Cthurath at this stage is that I\'m not entirely looking forward to staring at purple and orange fungus for the next year. Other than that, bring it on!&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/when-you-stare-into-void.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/when-you-stare-into-void.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEaYbMPNElK8CD4i_ZChZYT55f16x8EDsD86W-oZME0ktwG1l7V8lCcTqNKBADwvZZ4CeRHH_YLqmB3Ut1YaMjRjNNmQhSczchqVg3j0xn7tfyUYG6NCxtEPxbB28XaLeDsH0qsshTe784IeqhyXvmKd94poAHEcibQCv7xcL6SP_q7P4RGyzhuS8W-ZA/s72-w640-h358-c/eq2pl.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '3'}

For which, if accepted, you will be entitled to:</p><span style="font-size: medium;"><b></b></span><ul><blockquote><li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Full access to all adventure packs and expansions through the most recent release</b></span></li><li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>All-access account status</b></span></li><li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Marketplace cash each month for in-game use</b></span></li><li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Content Codes to give away to your audience</b></span></li><li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Access to promo content and preview codes for upcoming expansions</b></span></li><li><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Opportunities to be featured in official EQII social media or articles</b></span></li></blockquote></ul><div><p>Which, actually, isn\'t bad. You get free expansions beyond the ones that are already free anyway. You get your subscription paid, which is worth a decent chunk of cash. You get some toy money to spend in the game (Although I wonder if that\'s just the 500DBC you get for being an All Access member anyway?)</p><p>You get giveaways for your audience (<i>Twitch </i>Codes and the like, presumably.) You get a first look at the new stuff (Which as far as expansions go, you would generally get for pre-ordering anyway, so once again, probably nothing you couldn\'t already get as a regular player, just for free.) so you can write/talk/video about it, presumably, unless it\'s under NDA, of course. And you get to be talked about by people who actually get paid to do what you\'re doing for free. Big whoop.</p><p>Personally, I\'d rather pay for my own expansions and All Access membership and get to see everything at the same time as everyone else. I never use the beta access for Game Updates or expansions because it spoils the fun when the real thing arrives and as for getting the expansions and membership for free, I always feel that if someone\'s giving me stuff like that, even if they make it plain there are no strings, there are <i>ALWAYS </i>strings.</p><p>At the very least it makes me feel uncomfortable if I want to say something negative. It\'s bad-mannered, like accepting an invite to a dinner party, eating the food and then criticizing the host\'s taste in wallpaper and soft furnishings. I mean, you <i>can</i>, if you want, but everyone\'s going to think you\'re a dick, even if they secretly agree with you and so they should.</p><p>At this point, if I really wanted to bulk this post out, I\'d have no trouble doing it. The announcement goes on and on and on... I could cut and past half a dozen more sections like the above, most of which repeat the previous ones and maybe find something to say about them but that would be as much of an overkill as the thing itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Why there needs to be such a wealth of detail in the opening announcement beats me. Maybe the legal team wrote it. It certainly reads like it.</p><p>Anyway, I won\'t be applying but I can think of two or three bloggers who\'d I\'d happily endorse if they were interested. I imagine they\'d have more sense than to apply, though.</p><p>I\'ll be interested to see if the whole thing goes anywhere. I suspect it won\'t but I\'ll be happy enough if it does. More coverage of EQII out in the world&nbsp;<i>would </i>be nice, especially if I can scrape it for posts of my own!</p></div>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-FcMo9aFBg1uzhTjNaLG7OqVFZ9UU8j57gmB52l3U6eVKlylEx7LBZTBIJB_0SLG4QVFgqsW3xH7IDFrH20sTB_dmN5MvbHMqY5MluZirQi835jFGlihKRbNJ7qnU6Lkrrc8160XBad9y19nRJh8oR4OPrHof30Ig07m76ZrhGEuA05GS4_3fy1R2zqw/s3200/eq2cp1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-FcMo9aFBg1uzhTjNaLG7OqVFZ9UU8j57gmB52l3U6eVKlylEx7LBZTBIJB_0SLG4QVFgqsW3xH7IDFrH20sTB_dmN5MvbHMqY5MluZirQi835jFGlihKRbNJ7qnU6Lkrrc8160XBad9y19nRJh8oR4OPrHof30Ig07m76ZrhGEuA05GS4_3fy1R2zqw/w640-h360/eq2cp1.png" width="640" /></a></div>Due to circumstances beyond my control (Multiple mildly annoying real life events, mostly of the things breaking down or needing to be replaced variety, having to be dealt with at once.) posts here may be a tad more sporadic than usual for a while, and/or shorter, and/or obviously cobbled together in a few minutes with little or no regard to whether they make sense/are of interest to anyone/appear to be in any way original or worth the virtual paper they\'re written on.&nbsp;<p></p><p>Whether anyone would have noticed if I hadn\'t just pointed it out is another question altogether...</p><p>Anyway, in that spirit, here\'s something I bookmarked to write a thoughtful and considered post about and then did this instead.</p><p>Up there at the top, that\'s the splash for the new <i><a href="https://forums.everquest2.com/index.php?threads/everquest-ii-content-creator-program-signup.10353/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">EverQuest II Content Creator Program</span></a></i> as announced by Senior Community Manager <i>Angeliana </i>on the forums on Friday.

You get some toy money to spend in the game (Although I wonder if that\'s just the 500DBC you get for being an All Access member anyway?)</p><p>You get giveaways for your audience (<i>Twitch </i>Codes and the like, presumably.) You get a first look at the new stuff (Which as far as expansions go, you would generally get for pre-ordering anyway, so once again, probably nothing you couldn\'t already get as a regular player, just for free.) so you can write/talk/video about it, presumably, unless it\'s under NDA, of course. And you get to be talked about by people who actually get paid to do what you\'re doing for free. Big whoop.</p><p>Personally, I\'d rather pay for my own expansions and All Access membership and get to see everything at the same time as everyone else. I never use the beta access for Game Updates or expansions because it spoils the fun when the real thing arrives and as for getting the expansions and membership for free, I always feel that if someone\'s giving me stuff like that, even if they make it plain there are no strings, there are <i>ALWAYS </i>strings.</p><p>At the very least it makes me feel uncomfortable if I want to say something negative. It\'s bad-mannered, like accepting an invite to a dinner party, eating the food and then criticizing the host\'s taste in wallpaper and soft furnishings. I mean, you <i>can</i>, if you want, but everyone\'s going to think you\'re a dick, even if they secretly agree with you and so they should.</p><p>At this point, if I really wanted to bulk this post out, I\'d have no trouble doing it. The announcement goes on and on and on... I could cut and past half a dozen more sections like the above, most of which repeat the previous ones and maybe find something to say about them but that would be as much of an overkill as the thing itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Why there needs to be such a wealth of detail in the opening announcement beats me. Maybe the legal team wrote it. It certainly reads like it.</p><p>Anyway, I won\'t be applying but I can think of two or three bloggers who\'d I\'d happily endorse if they were interested. I imagine they\'d have more sense than to apply, though.</p><p>I\'ll be interested to see if the whole thing goes anywhere. I suspect it won\'t but I\'ll be happy enough if it does. More coverage of EQII out in the world&nbsp;<i>would </i>be nice, especially if I can scrape it for posts of my own!</p></div>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/slackers-wannabes-and-chancers-need-not.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/slackers-wannabes-and-chancers-need-not.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-FcMo9aFBg1uzhTjNaLG7OqVFZ9UU8j57gmB52l3U6eVKlylEx7LBZTBIJB_0SLG4QVFgqsW3xH7IDFrH20sTB_dmN5MvbHMqY5MluZirQi835jFGlihKRbNJ7qnU6Lkrrc8160XBad9y19nRJh8oR4OPrHof30Ig07m76ZrhGEuA05GS4_3fy1R2zqw/s72-w640-h360-c/eq2cp1.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '11'}

Not <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/wednesdays-child.html">the one</a></span> about <i>Wednesday </i>the show. The one I put up two days ago. The one that none of you have read.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, you <i>did </i>read it, did you? Congratulations! That puts you in quite the elite club. Want to know how to get into the club\'s super-secret, cool kids only treehouse? Click on the embedded <a href="https://youtu.be/_X1ONG28LBs"><span style="color: #04ff00;">video </span></a>in that post. If you\'re quick you could be the fifth person ever to see it!</p><p>I expect people not to watch the videos. Hardly anyone ever does. I can see how many times they\'ve been viewed on <i>YouTube </i>(And yes, I checked, and watching it on the blog does increment the YouTube counter.). The last one I did before this, for the post <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/some-puppy-walking.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Some Puppy Walking</span></a>,&nbsp; has been watched sixteen times. The post itself has over three hundred views so you do the math...</p><p>Three hundred views used to be bang on average for a post here, after it\'s been up for a week or more. So far, only forty-five people have viewed Wednesday\'s post, according to the little widget next to it in the post list in <i>Blogger</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s about the only stat I ever pay any attention to these days. I got very fed up with the unnecessary complexity of <i>Google Analytics</i>, so when they revamped it and you had to jump through a load of technical hoops to have your website included in the new version, I opted not to bother.</p><p>I also stopped looking at Blogger\'s own stats ages ago because they don\'t seem to filter out bots so they\'re always ludicrously inflated. Even the page-view number that I do still look at, mostly because it\'s always right there in front of me, is just the same number from the main stats, so I don\'t take it too seriously either.</p><p>Still, even bad stats are useful if they\'re consistent in their badness. Any sudden change means something must have happened. And there has been one heck of a big change just recently.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/s992/postcount1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="303" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/w400-h303/postcount1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Before Blaugust, that page view figure bobbled fairly consistently somewhere between 250 and 400 over the first seven days or so after the post published. Most posts stop picking up views after that although there can obviously be spikes at any time.<p></p><p>At this point, you\'re probably expecting me to say page views went up during Blaugust. That\'s always been the conventional wisdom and with this year having a record number of participants <i>and </i>with me consistently linking every post in the Blaugust Discord, it\'s more than reasonable to imagine it would hold true.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn\'t, though, or not for me. Most years I see little or no uptick in views from Blaugust and this year was much the same. Until the last week, that is.&nbsp;</p><p>From the 25th of August, page views almost doubled, averaging around seven or eight hundred. That bump carried on long after Blaugust ended and indeed became more pronounced as September went on, with quite a few posts hitting four figures, topping out at just over two thousand.</p><p>Why? No idea. I rarely have any clue why these things happen. And equally, I have no explanation for why they stop, which seems to be what\'s happened now. Only this time the drop is as spectacular as the rise was.</p><p>Generally, any post I put up gets most of its views in the first 24-48 hours, as you\'d expect. I haven\'t been keeping track but I\'m fairly sure back when they were finishing up with&nbsp; three or four hundred views, they\'d have seen half of those in the first two or three days.</p><p>The last two posts have so far managed 45 views in two days and 34 in 24 hours respectively. That doesn\'t seem normal to me, which is why this morning I started fiddling about in Google\'s stat cupboards to see if I could figure out what was going on.</p><p>I\'ll put you out of your suspense now. I did not figure out what was going on. I have no way of knowing whether regular readers have suddenly found better things to do or if Google has started tallying things differently. I\'ll just wait for it to change again, which it will.</p><p>I did, however, discover some other new and quite interesting things while I was rummaging and that\'s how this post came about.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/s1033/insights1.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="316" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/w400-h316/insights1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Firstly, I\'ll say that <i><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Google Search Console</span></a></i> is a huge improvement on Analytics for the casual user. If you have a Blogger blog, I\'d recommend giving it a look. It\'s much clearer, far&nbsp;easier to understand, and best of all it explains what the stats mean. You can set filters and use them to dig out some quite useful detail without a great deal of trouble.<p></p><p>I particularly liked the new <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/16308503"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Insights Report</span></a>, which gives you a very clear indication of which of your posts are trending up or down and enough granularity to take a shot at figuring out why. And that\'s where I noticed something very odd.</p><p>It wasn\'t that there\'d been a big spike in search requests for my post on housing in <i>Throne and Liberty</i>, which I put up just under a year ago. <i>T&amp;L</i> has just added housing so obviously people are googling for information on it, none of which they\'re going to find here.</p><p>It\'s harder to explain why there\'s been a surge of interest in <i>Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt</i>. If anything new is happening there, I\'ve missed it. Two of my posts about it do turn up on the first page of Google Search results though, so I guess if anyone is still interested, they might well give me a look.</p><p>The one that really set me thinking, though, was the sudden interest in&nbsp;<a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/09/stardust-memories-and-other-short.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">this post</span></a> from just over a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s a "<i>What I\'ve Been Listening To Lately</i>" post. No-one reads those. Okay, some people do, but clearly that series isn\'t going to come up in a general search very often. Yes, they do often have the names of famous people in the body of the post but hardly ever in the title and let\'s be realistic here - even putting <i>Taylor Swift</i>\'s name in the title of your blog post is not going to get you onto the first hundred pages on a search result, is it? I mean, there\'s a lot of competition there...</p><p>In the case of this particular post, I didn\'t mention Taylor Swift in the title (Although <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5URefVYaJrA"><span style="color: #04ff00;">A$AP Rocky\'s Taylor Swif </span></a></i>is one the featured tunes.) or anyone even close to being that famous. I did, as it happens, mention the name of a <i>Woody Allen </i>movie that doesn\'t even feature in the post at all, but that\'s not what people were searching for.</p><p>They were looking for a band called <i>X-Cetra,</i> a bunch of Californian tweenage girls who made a very odd album by the name of <i>Stardust </i>a couple of decades ago. I said in the post that X-Cetra didn\'t even have a Wikipedia page. I just checked and they still don\'t. I guess that explains why someone would bother to click through to a blog that mentioned them.</p><p>And they have. Not in the kind of numbers that click through to check on posts about clothes or housing in <i>Once Human</i>, which seem to be by far the biggest draw here over the last twelve months, but in numbers that feel statistically significant, especially since most of them appear to have happened not when I put the post up last year but in this last month.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/s1180/x-cetra%202.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="368" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/w640-h368/x-cetra%202.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>In fact, my top search query for September is "<i>X-cetra stardust</i>" and two more variations of the phrase are also in the top ten. Altogether, there were 829 searches for X-Cetra Stardust in the last 28 days and twenty-nine people clicked through to look at the page in full. It may not sound like a great conversion rate but in comparison, of more than a thousand inquiries about housing in Throne &amp; Liberty, only nine people clicked.</p><p>What\'s even more interesting is that, of the 39 clicks from search the post has ever received, 38 of them were in the last month. There was a huge spike (Seven clicks!) on 3 September and it\'s been ticking away ever since.</p><p>If there\'s been any general news about the album or the band, I\'m not aware of it. Google Trends does confirm a huge spike of interest on 3 September but a general search finds nothing special.</p><p>Enter Blaugustian <i>Calishat </i>with their invaluable selection of search refinement tools. With the inestimable <i><a href="https://searchtweaks.com/back-that-ask-up.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Back That Ask Up</span></a></i> utility I was able to narrow my search down to the exact moment of the spike and find the reason for it - an article in&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone</i>&nbsp;entitled "<span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/x-cetra-stardust-album-kids-story-1235418348/"><i>Four Best Friends Made an Album as Kids. 25 Years Later, It’s a Cult Classic</i></a></span>"</p><p>It\'s a big article with lots of new information. It even links to a "<i><a href="https://loki23.blogspot.com/2006/06/x-cetra_28.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Blogspot User</span></a></i>", sadly not me. I bet they got some page views that day. I just got the spill-over.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait. There\'s more.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given the paucity of information on the band, my post does appear on the first page of Google search results, but you have to scroll down a fair way. The thing that amazed me and led to this post, though, is what I saw at the top of the page.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s in the image up there at the head of this post. That\'s a screenshot of the top of a Google search page, the bit I rarely look at. I almost always scroll straight past all of the featured links and the AI summaries to the point where the old school listings start and go from there.</p><p>In the middle, with the eye-catching thumbnail of <i>Teri Gender Bender</i> from <i>Le Butcherettes</i>, is a link to my post. Why I\'m getting that prime spot rather than, say, the Rolling Stone article, I have no idea but I\'ll happily take it.&nbsp;</p><p>That big panel across the top of the results seems only to appear if you search for specific entity by name. It works for bands, albums, movies, actors, games... As soon as you add any detail to the query, though, it vanishes. Has it always been there? I guess I hardly ever search for anything purely by name so I would very rarely see it.&nbsp;</p><p>I might have to&nbsp; pay it more attention, now I discover that one of my posts has been featured that way. I guess it proves you don\'t have to pay to get featured on Google search, at least.</p><p>And after all that, I guess my extremely late for Blaugust advice on how to get more page views and clicks would have to be write about very obscure things no-one else is covering or clothes and housing in online games. That\'s what seems to be working for me, anyway.</p><p>For a given value of "<i>working</i>", that is. A very, very tiny one.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUxG9Ma1NWHR_5gXbH5rvuUtjZorN_Klzi1nO7VTGqh1ib5YJ2ztC9a0Krz7yZRQU-ELugUy_nRzjJ_pV66j8jXXhVl3M5LtkT2BJ0eFw9ZouA1Mka7nsgzGz7IoSo_xdfReDThbu7tessxVMUVPUu4CojTbIqW_X1uEfUNlsqyyzVZQee4_kC4uv29xQ/s1482/xcetragoogle1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="386" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUxG9Ma1NWHR_5gXbH5rvuUtjZorN_Klzi1nO7VTGqh1ib5YJ2ztC9a0Krz7yZRQU-ELugUy_nRzjJ_pV66j8jXXhVl3M5LtkT2BJ0eFw9ZouA1Mka7nsgzGz7IoSo_xdfReDThbu7tessxVMUVPUu4CojTbIqW_X1uEfUNlsqyyzVZQee4_kC4uv29xQ/w640-h386/xcetragoogle1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />Who\'s up for some blogging about blogging?

And there has been one heck of a big change just recently.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/s992/postcount1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="303" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/w400-h303/postcount1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Before Blaugust, that page view figure bobbled fairly consistently somewhere between 250 and 400 over the first seven days or so after the post published. Most posts stop picking up views after that although there can obviously be spikes at any time.<p></p><p>At this point, you\'re probably expecting me to say page views went up during Blaugust. That\'s always been the conventional wisdom and with this year having a record number of participants <i>and </i>with me consistently linking every post in the Blaugust Discord, it\'s more than reasonable to imagine it would hold true.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn\'t, though, or not for me. Most years I see little or no uptick in views from Blaugust and this year was much the same. Until the last week, that is.&nbsp;</p><p>From the 25th of August, page views almost doubled, averaging around seven or eight hundred. That bump carried on long after Blaugust ended and indeed became more pronounced as September went on, with quite a few posts hitting four figures, topping out at just over two thousand.</p><p>Why? No idea. I rarely have any clue why these things happen. And equally, I have no explanation for why they stop, which seems to be what\'s happened now. Only this time the drop is as spectacular as the rise was.</p><p>Generally, any post I put up gets most of its views in the first 24-48 hours, as you\'d expect. I haven\'t been keeping track but I\'m fairly sure back when they were finishing up with&nbsp; three or four hundred views, they\'d have seen half of those in the first two or three days.</p><p>The last two posts have so far managed 45 views in two days and 34 in 24 hours respectively. That doesn\'t seem normal to me, which is why this morning I started fiddling about in Google\'s stat cupboards to see if I could figure out what was going on.</p><p>I\'ll put you out of your suspense now. I did not figure out what was going on. I have no way of knowing whether regular readers have suddenly found better things to do or if Google has started tallying things differently. I\'ll just wait for it to change again, which it will.</p><p>I did, however, discover some other new and quite interesting things while I was rummaging and that\'s how this post came about.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/s1033/insights1.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="316" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/w400-h316/insights1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Firstly, I\'ll say that <i><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Google Search Console</span></a></i> is a huge improvement on Analytics for the casual user. If you have a Blogger blog, I\'d recommend giving it a look. It\'s much clearer, far&nbsp;easier to understand, and best of all it explains what the stats mean. You can set filters and use them to dig out some quite useful detail without a great deal of trouble.<p></p><p>I particularly liked the new <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/16308503"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Insights Report</span></a>, which gives you a very clear indication of which of your posts are trending up or down and enough granularity to take a shot at figuring out why. And that\'s where I noticed something very odd.</p><p>It wasn\'t that there\'d been a big spike in search requests for my post on housing in <i>Throne and Liberty</i>, which I put up just under a year ago. <i>T&amp;L</i> has just added housing so obviously people are googling for information on it, none of which they\'re going to find here.</p><p>It\'s harder to explain why there\'s been a surge of interest in <i>Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt</i>. If anything new is happening there, I\'ve missed it. Two of my posts about it do turn up on the first page of Google Search results though, so I guess if anyone is still interested, they might well give me a look.</p><p>The one that really set me thinking, though, was the sudden interest in&nbsp;<a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/09/stardust-memories-and-other-short.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">this post</span></a> from just over a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s a "<i>What I\'ve Been Listening To Lately</i>" post. No-one reads those. Okay, some people do, but clearly that series isn\'t going to come up in a general search very often. Yes, they do often have the names of famous people in the body of the post but hardly ever in the title and let\'s be realistic here - even putting <i>Taylor Swift</i>\'s name in the title of your blog post is not going to get you onto the first hundred pages on a search result, is it? I mean, there\'s a lot of competition there...</p><p>In the case of this particular post, I didn\'t mention Taylor Swift in the title (Although <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5URefVYaJrA"><span style="color: #04ff00;">A$AP Rocky\'s Taylor Swif </span></a></i>is one the featured tunes.) or anyone even close to being that famous. I did, as it happens, mention the name of a <i>Woody Allen </i>movie that doesn\'t even feature in the post at all, but that\'s not what people were searching for.</p><p>They were looking for a band called <i>X-Cetra,</i> a bunch of Californian tweenage girls who made a very odd album by the name of <i>Stardust </i>a couple of decades ago. I said in the post that X-Cetra didn\'t even have a Wikipedia page. I just checked and they still don\'t. I guess that explains why someone would bother to click through to a blog that mentioned them.</p><p>And they have. Not in the kind of numbers that click through to check on posts about clothes or housing in <i>Once Human</i>, which seem to be by far the biggest draw here over the last twelve months, but in numbers that feel statistically significant, especially since most of them appear to have happened not when I put the post up last year but in this last month.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/s1180/x-cetra%202.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="368" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/w640-h368/x-cetra%202.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>In fact, my top search query for September is "<i>X-cetra stardust</i>" and two more variations of the phrase are also in the top ten. Altogether, there were 829 searches for X-Cetra Stardust in the last 28 days and twenty-nine people clicked through to look at the page in full. It may not sound like a great conversion rate but in comparison, of more than a thousand inquiries about housing in Throne &amp; Liberty, only nine people clicked.</p><p>What\'s even more interesting is that, of the 39 clicks from search the post has ever received, 38 of them were in the last month. There was a huge spike (Seven clicks!) on 3 September and it\'s been ticking away ever since.</p><p>If there\'s been any general news about the album or the band, I\'m not aware of it. Google Trends does confirm a huge spike of interest on 3 September but a general search finds nothing special.</p><p>Enter Blaugustian <i>Calishat </i>with their invaluable selection of search refinement tools. With the inestimable <i><a href="https://searchtweaks.com/back-that-ask-up.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Back That Ask Up</span></a></i> utility I was able to narrow my search down to the exact moment of the spike and find the reason for it - an article in&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone</i>&nbsp;entitled "<span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/x-cetra-stardust-album-kids-story-1235418348/"><i>Four Best Friends Made an Album as Kids. 25 Years Later, It’s a Cult Classic</i></a></span>"</p><p>It\'s a big article with lots of new information. It even links to a "<i><a href="https://loki23.blogspot.com/2006/06/x-cetra_28.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Blogspot User</span></a></i>", sadly not me. I bet they got some page views that day. I just got the spill-over.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait. There\'s more.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given the paucity of information on the band, my post does appear on the first page of Google search results, but you have to scroll down a fair way. The thing that amazed me and led to this post, though, is what I saw at the top of the page.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s in the image up there at the head of this post. That\'s a screenshot of the top of a Google search page, the bit I rarely look at. I almost always scroll straight past all of the featured links and the AI summaries to the point where the old school listings start and go from there.</p><p>In the middle, with the eye-catching thumbnail of <i>Teri Gender Bender</i> from <i>Le Butcherettes</i>, is a link to my post. Why I\'m getting that prime spot rather than, say, the Rolling Stone article, I have no idea but I\'ll happily take it.&nbsp;</p><p>That big panel across the top of the results seems only to appear if you search for specific entity by name. It works for bands, albums, movies, actors, games... As soon as you add any detail to the query, though, it vanishes. Has it always been there? I guess I hardly ever search for anything purely by name so I would very rarely see it.&nbsp;</p><p>I might have to&nbsp; pay it more attention, now I discover that one of my posts has been featured that way. I guess it proves you don\'t have to pay to get featured on Google search, at least.</p><p>And after all that, I guess my extremely late for Blaugust advice on how to get more page views and clicks would have to be write about very obscure things no-one else is covering or clothes and housing in online games. That\'s what seems to be working for me, anyway.</p><p>For a given value of "<i>working</i>", that is. A very, very tiny one.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/page-counts-clicks-x-cetra.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/page-counts-clicks-x-cetra.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUxG9Ma1NWHR_5gXbH5rvuUtjZorN_Klzi1nO7VTGqh1ib5YJ2ztC9a0Krz7yZRQU-ELugUy_nRzjJ_pV66j8jXXhVl3M5LtkT2BJ0eFw9ZouA1Mka7nsgzGz7IoSo_xdfReDThbu7tessxVMUVPUu4CojTbIqW_X1uEfUNlsqyyzVZQee4_kC4uv29xQ/s72-w640-h386-c/xcetragoogle1.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '12'}

I played<i> EverQuest II.</i></p><p>I don\'t mean I logged in, collected my completed <i>Overseer </i>missions, set my new ones for the day and logged out, like I do every day. Although, I <i>did </i>do all of that... except the logging out part.</p><p>I\'d been getting a slight itch to play an MMORPG "<i>properly</i>" again for a couple of days. It started, weirdly, when I was on <i>Steam </i>and noticed there were some patch notes for <i>Rift</i>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>It\'s a constant surprise to see dribbles of content still dripping into the game during&nbsp;<i>Gamigo</i>\'s maintenance-mode custodianship but guess perhaps the oddest thing is that I still have Rift installed. It\'s not like I\'m going to play it again.&nbsp;</p><p>Or is it?</p><p>It was when I found myself seriously considering doing just that, wondering whether I ought to pick up one of my old characters and carry on with them or if it mightn\'t be better to roll up a new one and start over, that I had a little talk with myself and decided I\'d be better off doing something productive in one of the games I was supposedly still playing istead, not taking a wholly ill-advised trip back in time to one I\'d abandoned years ago.</p><p>The choice was pretty obvious. I clearly ought to patch up <i>Wuthering Waves</i> and try to get back up to date there yet again. There\'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuht8zMs93E"><span style="color: #04ff00;">another update</span></a> coming and I haven\'t touched the last one yet. I\'m already behind and soon I\'ll be too far behind to catch up.</p><p>So, I didn\'t do that.</p><p>Second choice would probably be <i>Once Human</i>.

I realy like New World. It\'s my second most-played game on Steam, after <i>Valheim</i>. There\'s <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/season-10-nighthaven-announcement"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a major update</span></a> - you could almost call it an expansion - coming to the game in less than two weeks and it looks very interesting, all vampires and werewolves and spooky castles. Just right for the season</p><p>It\'s a free update but you have to have <i>New World Aeternum</i> to get it and I don\'t. So I\'d have to buy that, which would then give me even more new-to-me content. And contrary to what you might expect, that\'s actually a point against going back. I don\'t have the time or inclination to take on a big tranche of content in any game right now. I\'m looking for something to fill the odd session, here and there, not some big commitment that could take weeks.</p><p>Something like, oh, I don\'t know, a new solo dungeon or an instance I haven\'t done. Even better, one that might have some drops I could use. I\'ve always been a big advocate of the gameplay being its own reward but good drops are cake.</p><p>All of that led me back to <i>EQII</i>, where there have been two Game Updates this year that I haven\'t touched.&nbsp;</p><p>Alright, that\'s not entirely true. I did set foot in the new, contested dungeon that came in GU128 back in April. It didn\'t go well.</p><p>That update is called <i>Lure of Darkness</i> and features a large dungeon by the name of <i>Spiral of Vul</i>. It\'s designed for multiple groups to explore at the same time, old-school style, but it does have a small, soloable area at the front, as has been the norm in EQII as far back as beta.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/s1920/eq2totf3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/w640-h360/eq2totf3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I can say from experience that the allocated area for solo players <i>is </i>soloable. I did a little bit of it back in April and I didn\'t die. I also didn\'t have much fun. The mobs were very tough and took ages to kill. If there are any soloable bosses, I never got far enough to try my luck with them. I did one quest, whch took about half an hour and gave up.</p><p>That was on my Berserker. Since then, I\'ve upgraded all his gear using the Anniversary gift. He was mostly in 475-495 Resolve gear then and now he\'s wearing all 525. Resolve is a very sound indicator of performance, much like Gear Score in other games, and 30-50 points is enough to make a difference so I was hopeful I might get a little further this time.</p><p>I did not. I map-hopped over to the <i>Sodden Archipelago</i> and flew halfway across the zone to the entrance of the dungeon, went inside and immediately picked up a couple of shinies that completed a collection. That made the trip worthwhile, which was just as well because the trash mobs seemed no easier to kill than before. I tried a couple, decided it wasn\'t going to be any more fun than last time, so I&nbsp; left.</p><p>The second of the annual updates arrived in August. It\'s called<i> Fear of Eternity</i> and consists of Fabled versions of the dungeons from the 2012 expansion, <i>Chains of Eternity</i>. Fabled dungeons are generally the same as the originals but with all the mobs revamped for the current level cap and all the loot similarly upgraded. They also come in all the regular flavors - Solo, Heroic I and Heroic II.</p><p>My experience with Fabled dungeons at the time they first appear has been patchy. There have been some I\'ve been able to make progress in but mostly they\'re too tough for me. I usually give them a go, decide it\'s too much like hard work and leave them for later. Sometimes I do come back and finish them when I\'m a bit tougher, sometimes I forget they exist.</p><p>I was fully expecting the first one I tried, <i>Fabled Temple of the Faceless</i>, to be at least as hard as Spiral of Vul. I mean, you\'d think so, woudn\'t you? It\'s six months later, after all. What would be the point of adding something easier to the game at level cap?</p><p>It <i>was </i>easier. It was a lot easier. At least it was once I got myself sorted out.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/s639/eq2tofs2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/w400-h388/eq2tofs2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>The zone-in is much more conveniently placed, right on the dock where you zone in to Sodden Archipelago. No flying right across the map this time. That was nice. You can access all the available dungeons from the update from the same portal, too. Also nice.<p></p><p>I picked the first instance on the list, zoned in and pulled a mob to test the waters. They were warm. The mob, a three-up arrow spider, theoretically tough for trash, died in a reasonable time and didn\'t pose much of&nbsp; threat. I worked my across the opening area towards the first boss, killing as I went and it felt comfortable. It wasn\'t a walkover but it wasn\'t a grind. I felt like I was moving through the zone at a reasonable pace.</p><p>I got in range of the boss and thought about looking him up for strats but I couldn\'t be bothered so I just pulled him to see what would happen. Nothing much. In fact, as far as he was concerned, nothing at all. His health stayed solidly at 100% no matter how hard and how often I hit him. Clearly there were unseen factors in play.</p><p>With my merc pumping out the healing and the Berserker having a pretty solid self-healing capacity of his own it was a stalemate, albeit one that was eventually only going to end one way, even if it was likely to take an hour to get there. I rummaged in my bags for a <i>Totem of Escape</i> to port myself to the zone entrance and couldn\'t find one so I just legged it to the zone-line with the boss beating on me all the way. He still didn\'t make much of a dent, even with my back turned.</p><p>Once I was safe outside, I looked at the wiki. It turns out there are two pillars, one in each of two side-temples, that have to be destroyed before the first boss can be damaged. I vaguely remembered that from whenever I did the dungeon when I was questing through the relevant expansion but that was years ago and I needed to be reminded.</p><p>I went back in, found the pillars, knocked them down, then had a second go at the boss. It went much better that time.&nbsp;</p><p>I was curious to see what he\'d drop. I was hoping it would be gear over 500 Resolve. In fact it was identical in quality to the Anniversary freebies - 525 Resolve. Since I was already fully kitted out in that, I was also hoping it wouldn\'t be Plate Armor. I could give that to my Inquisitor but she\'s not Level 130 yet so she\'d have to do five more levels before she could wear it.</p><p>I was hoping for cloth so my Necro could have it and cloth was what I got. On the first boss, anyway.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/s1249/eq2totf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/w640-h302/eq2totf1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>It had been fun and profitable so far so I carried on. Temple of The Faceless is a fairly compact, to the point dungeon, without a lot of wandering about required. Exactly what I was looking for. I progressed through the next two bosses, checking strats just in case of any more surprises but having very little trouble with either.</p><p>That took me up to bedtime so I camped where I was and picked up again where I left off the next morning.

I played<i> EverQuest II.</i></p><p>I don\'t mean I logged in, collected my completed <i>Overseer </i>missions, set my new ones for the day and logged out, like I do every day. Although, I <i>did </i>do all of that... except the logging out part.</p><p>I\'d been getting a slight itch to play an MMORPG "<i>properly</i>" again for a couple of days. It started, weirdly, when I was on <i>Steam </i>and noticed there were some patch notes for <i>Rift</i>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>It\'s a constant surprise to see dribbles of content still dripping into the game during&nbsp;<i>Gamigo</i>\'s maintenance-mode custodianship but guess perhaps the oddest thing is that I still have Rift installed. It\'s not like I\'m going to play it again.&nbsp;</p><p>Or is it?</p><p>It was when I found myself seriously considering doing just that, wondering whether I ought to pick up one of my old characters and carry on with them or if it mightn\'t be better to roll up a new one and start over, that I had a little talk with myself and decided I\'d be better off doing something productive in one of the games I was supposedly still playing istead, not taking a wholly ill-advised trip back in time to one I\'d abandoned years ago.</p><p>The choice was pretty obvious. I clearly ought to patch up <i>Wuthering Waves</i> and try to get back up to date there yet again. There\'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuht8zMs93E"><span style="color: #04ff00;">another update</span></a> coming and I haven\'t touched the last one yet. I\'m already behind and soon I\'ll be too far behind to catch up.</p><p>So, I didn\'t do that.</p><p>Second choice would probably be <i>Once Human</i>. There\'s a lot <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20250919/40780_1260194.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">going on</span></a> there, too, and I haven\'t seen any of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Didn\'t do that, either.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSjNTl6_OhInHyhU2I3hER5Ptr5VeDiVFaOUdji_jiZ9gPzw8JTz7MOtMWAYCkNJIKtcuC2vI-ljoh_1k9V29qhklJk1zojehj-bsSBe2xOIIIM2Px8vFZSm9EdM1_ZBCIAexG0RnsmpTXVItHQ6O5KdniS9FgmFjU45SEk7Zy72bRp-TylKShZfiG62s/s1920/eq2totf2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSjNTl6_OhInHyhU2I3hER5Ptr5VeDiVFaOUdji_jiZ9gPzw8JTz7MOtMWAYCkNJIKtcuC2vI-ljoh_1k9V29qhklJk1zojehj-bsSBe2xOIIIM2Px8vFZSm9EdM1_ZBCIAexG0RnsmpTXVItHQ6O5KdniS9FgmFjU45SEk7Zy72bRp-TylKShZfiG62s/w640-h360/eq2totf2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Also in the running, albeit as an outsider, there\'s <i>New World</i>. I realy like New World. It\'s my second most-played game on Steam, after <i>Valheim</i>. There\'s <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/season-10-nighthaven-announcement"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a major update</span></a> - you could almost call it an expansion - coming to the game in less than two weeks and it looks very interesting, all vampires and werewolves and spooky castles. Just right for the season</p><p>It\'s a free update but you have to have <i>New World Aeternum</i> to get it and I don\'t. So I\'d have to buy that, which would then give me even more new-to-me content. And contrary to what you might expect, that\'s actually a point against going back. I don\'t have the time or inclination to take on a big tranche of content in any game right now. I\'m looking for something to fill the odd session, here and there, not some big commitment that could take weeks.</p><p>Something like, oh, I don\'t know, a new solo dungeon or an instance I haven\'t done. Even better, one that might have some drops I could use. I\'ve always been a big advocate of the gameplay being its own reward but good drops are cake.</p><p>All of that led me back to <i>EQII</i>, where there have been two Game Updates this year that I haven\'t touched.&nbsp;</p><p>Alright, that\'s not entirely true. I did set foot in the new, contested dungeon that came in GU128 back in April. It didn\'t go well.</p><p>That update is called <i>Lure of Darkness</i> and features a large dungeon by the name of <i>Spiral of Vul</i>. It\'s designed for multiple groups to explore at the same time, old-school style, but it does have a small, soloable area at the front, as has been the norm in EQII as far back as beta.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/s1920/eq2totf3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/w640-h360/eq2totf3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I can say from experience that the allocated area for solo players <i>is </i>soloable. I did a little bit of it back in April and I didn\'t die. I also didn\'t have much fun. The mobs were very tough and took ages to kill. If there are any soloable bosses, I never got far enough to try my luck with them. I did one quest, whch took about half an hour and gave up.</p><p>That was on my Berserker. Since then, I\'ve upgraded all his gear using the Anniversary gift. He was mostly in 475-495 Resolve gear then and now he\'s wearing all 525. Resolve is a very sound indicator of performance, much like Gear Score in other games, and 30-50 points is enough to make a difference so I was hopeful I might get a little further this time.</p><p>I did not. I map-hopped over to the <i>Sodden Archipelago</i> and flew halfway across the zone to the entrance of the dungeon, went inside and immediately picked up a couple of shinies that completed a collection. That made the trip worthwhile, which was just as well because the trash mobs seemed no easier to kill than before. I tried a couple, decided it wasn\'t going to be any more fun than last time, so I&nbsp; left.</p><p>The second of the annual updates arrived in August. It\'s called<i> Fear of Eternity</i> and consists of Fabled versions of the dungeons from the 2012 expansion, <i>Chains of Eternity</i>. Fabled dungeons are generally the same as the originals but with all the mobs revamped for the current level cap and all the loot similarly upgraded. They also come in all the regular flavors - Solo, Heroic I and Heroic II.</p><p>My experience with Fabled dungeons at the time they first appear has been patchy. There have been some I\'ve been able to make progress in but mostly they\'re too tough for me. I usually give them a go, decide it\'s too much like hard work and leave them for later. Sometimes I do come back and finish them when I\'m a bit tougher, sometimes I forget they exist.</p><p>I was fully expecting the first one I tried, <i>Fabled Temple of the Faceless</i>, to be at least as hard as Spiral of Vul. I mean, you\'d think so, woudn\'t you? It\'s six months later, after all. What would be the point of adding something easier to the game at level cap?</p><p>It <i>was </i>easier. It was a lot easier. At least it was once I got myself sorted out.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/s639/eq2tofs2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/w400-h388/eq2tofs2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>The zone-in is much more conveniently placed, right on the dock where you zone in to Sodden Archipelago. No flying right across the map this time. That was nice. You can access all the available dungeons from the update from the same portal, too. Also nice.<p></p><p>I picked the first instance on the list, zoned in and pulled a mob to test the waters. They were warm. The mob, a three-up arrow spider, theoretically tough for trash, died in a reasonable time and didn\'t pose much of&nbsp; threat.

I finally ran out of things I\nwrote or recorded in the 70s, 80s and 90s that I could refashion or remake into\nnew songs using AI. It\'s taken me more than six months, hacking away at the past\na little more every day, but now it\'s clear cut and there\'s nothing left but\nstumps.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Well, okay, not exactly. I could give the longer pieces another pass or two.\n  See if there\'s anything I missed. I didn\'t really pry all that much away from\n  the longer of the two extended pieces of fiction because most of it seemed\n  unsuitable for conversion into song lyrics but maybe a different musical genre\n  would shake something else loose. Everything can\'t be sad dreampop.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And there might be the odd fragment I haven\'t found, left lurking somewhere in\n  the house. I can think of a couple of pieces I remember writing that haven\'t\n  turned up yet. One of them would be perfect. But if they still exist, I\'ve run\n  out of ideas on where to look.

I could give the longer pieces another pass or two.\n  See if there\'s anything I missed. I didn\'t really pry all that much away from\n  the longer of the two extended pieces of fiction because most of it seemed\n  unsuitable for conversion into song lyrics but maybe a different musical genre\n  would shake something else loose. Everything can\'t be sad dreampop.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And there might be the odd fragment I haven\'t found, left lurking somewhere in\n  the house. I can think of a couple of pieces I remember writing that haven\'t\n  turned up yet. One of them would be perfect. But if they still exist, I\'ve run\n  out of ideas on where to look.

I was up to about a couple of\nhours a day, mostly last thing every night, but now I spend that time on my\nlaptop, burning through Credits on <i>Suno </i>and stitching fragments together\ninto songs in <i>Audacity</i>.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'m still paying several subscriptions to streaming services all the same,\n  though, so I feel obligated to make at least some use of all of them. We did\n  pause&nbsp;<i>Netflix </i>for three months but I re-started it for\n  <i>Wednesday </i>(And happily caught the finale of <i>Upload </i>around the\n  same time.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  While I was looking through the schedules for more to watch, so as to get my\n  money\'s-worth, I noticed the missing seasons of couple of shows I had been\n  following a few months ago had miraculously appeared.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  One of them was <i>Roswell: New Mexico,</i> for which Netflix very annoyingly\n  had held the license to Seasons 1 and 2 in the UK but not Seasons 3 and 4,\n  which&nbsp;were exclusive to <i>Sky </i>over here&nbsp;a the time (If I\n  remember right...). That was great but also too late because, when I finished\n  the first two seasons, I didn\'t want to pay yet another sub so I used a VPN to\n  watch them on Netflix USA.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even more annoying was <i>Young Sheldon</i>, for which Netflix had the rights\n  to stream six out of seven seasons in both the UK and the US but no rights to\n  the final season for either. That was on some US station or service I forget\n  now. All I do remember about it was that I couldn\'t watch it, even with a VPN.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, that agreement, whatever it was, must be over now because Netflix has\n  the full run available to stream. I was finally able to catch up with the\n  show. I\'ll tell you what I thought of it later.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Our other streaming service is <i>Amazon Prime </i>but that one pays for\n  itself in shipping alone, particularly since Mrs. Bhagpuss buys at least one\n  thing on <i>Amazon </i>pretty much every day. What with that and the games and\n  music offers included in the bundle, I feel no urge to watch anything on Prime\n  at all if I don\'t feel like it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The problem there is that I also have <i>Apple+</i> through Prime as an\n  add-on. It was very cheap for three months and I didn\'t really care if I was\n  watching anything on Apple+ or not but now it\'s back up to full price it seems\n  like I should at least watch <i>something</i>. Mrs Bhagpuss doesn\'t currently\n  watch anything on the channel at all so it\'s up to me to pick up the\n  slack.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Luckily, there\'s no shortage of good stuff to choose from. I thought about\n  starting several series about which I\'d heard good things -\n  <i>Severance, Slow Horses, Foundation, The Studio</i> - but in the end I\n  decided on <i>Ted Lasso</i>. Main reason: the episodes were shorter. Secondary\n  reason: I like sitcoms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have now watched all of Young Sheldon Season 7 and Ted Lasso Season 1. The\n  end of one story, the start of another. Here\'s what I thought about them both.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Young Sheldon</i> - Season 7</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was quite dubious about the whole concept of Young Sheldon to begin with.\n  I\'ve never been a huge fan of prequels (Is anyone?) and prequels built around\n  main characters as children can come across as a bit desperate. Added to that,\n  this is just one character from an ensemble show, one that relies almost\n  entirely on the particular skills of the specific actor who played him,\n  <i>and </i>it\'s a character often considered to be difficult and\n  controversial.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The prospects didn\'t look good but contrary to expectations it turned out to\n  be a warm, comfortable, enjoyable watch. A lot less spiky and brittle than the\n  show that spawned it, in fact.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, it also had one other, major problem, something common to all\n  long-running shows that revolve around a young child. Children grow up.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In one respect, that worked in Young Sheldon\'s favor. Old Sheldon, if we can\n  call him that, is a divisive figure in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. A lot of\n  people have some very valid objections to the character in terms of the way it\n  can appear to promote and perpetuate some stereotypically negative views of\n  neuro-diversity. I personally feel the full character arc, taken across the\n  entire run of the show, counters many of those objections, producing a nuanced\n  and distinctly positive image of someone struggling with numerous challenges\n  they find it hard to overcome.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if that\'s true, though, you\'d need to have watched the entire 279\n  episodes to appreciate it. And no-one who thinks Sheldon is an offensive\n  caricature is going to sit through 93 hours of a show that makes their skin\n  crawl just to see if maybe it wasn\'t quite as bad as they thought it was after\n  all. As the saying goes, that\'s an awful lot of Shawshank before you get to\n  the Redemption.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I didn\'t think Young Sheldon had the same level of difficulty. In <i>TBBT</i>,\n  there are five central characters and it\'s not hard to make an argument that\n  all of them are potentially offensive in the way they\'re written and\n  performed. Young Sheldon just has... young Sheldon. And he\'s kinda cute.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All those mannerisms and affectations that seem so mannered and performative\n  in an adult seem a lot softer and more relatable in a child. Kids, after all,\n  <i>do </i>say and do<i>&nbsp;</i>the darnedest things, don\'t they? And it is\n  undeniably satisfying, if you\'ve watched a lot of TBBT, to see many of\n  Sheldon\'s tropes and foibles from that show get their start in some specific\n  event in this one, usually for an understandable and sympathetic reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that is in the show as a whole, though. What about the final\n  season?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, the most striking thing about it is that Sheldon isn\'t actually in it\n  all that much. He\'s in every episode but he\'s rarely the central character and\n  the main story arcs seldom revolve around him. He\'s almost a peripheral\n  character at times, chipping in with a few side-stories or popping up to add\n  some extra perspective to someone else\'s story.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, it\'s about his family, all of whom get some significant character\n  development that changes or enhances what we knew about them. For example...\n</p>\n<p>(This bit might get a bit spoilery from here on down...)</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Meemaw </i>really starts to show her age as she loses her home, her\n  business and her freedom all in quick succession. Her veneer of invincibility\n  begins to peel away and her indomitable spirit wilts a little.\n  <i>Missy </i>shows a good deal of unexpected maturity and character growth as\n  does <i>Georgie</i>, albeit each in very different ways. Sheldon\'s mother\'s\n  religious beliefs start to move her closer to the mania seen in the adult\n  show, while his father... dies.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That was a shock, even though if I\'d been counting the passage of time I\nought to have expected it. It happens right towards the end of the run, just\nwhen everything seems to be going pretty well for him and the family.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was not best pleased when it happened, not only because I liked the\n  character as played by <i>Lance Barber</i> but because I had Young Sheldon\n  firmly in my "<i>Send me off to sleep in a good mood</i>." slot and it seemed\n  like it was going to finish with a couple of episodes where all the cast would\n  be in mourning and filled with grief. Not what I want, right before I nod off.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the end, though, the whole thing was handled very gently, not side-stepping\n  the emotions but not losing the warmth and humor either. It was a particularly\n  telling way to show some of Sheldon\'s emotional growth or lack of it, too,\n  something I also thought was well-handled.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As a run, I\'d call Young Sheldon a success. It lasted seven seasons, which is\n  more than decent for a sitcom. It kept the whole cast together and it was\n  consistently written and well-played throughout by an excellent ensemble cast.\n  It was great to see Annie Potts and <i>Ed Begley Jr</i>. in meaty roles again,\n  too.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The underlying problem of child actors turning into adult actors was kept to a\n  minimum by the unusual expedient of partially writing the lead character out\n  of his own show. Missy and Georgie both seemed to age at a rate that allowed\n  the audience barely to notice it happening but by Season 7,<i>\n    Iain Armitage</i>, playing Sheldon, looked very odd indeed, like a much older child playing a\n  much younger one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The same mannerisms that had made him a cute-if-quirky kid turned him into a\n  slightly disturbing adolescent, never changing his expression, keeping his\n  hands stiffly by his sides and always wearing awkwardly formal clothes. That\n  looks funny in an eight-year old but uncomfortable and unsettling in a\n  teenager. It\'s not surprising they mostly wrote around him towards the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The ensemble cast was uniformly excellent. I liked everyone, which is ideal\n  for a sitcom. I especially enjoyed <i>Annie Potts </i>as Meemaw and her double\n  act with <i>Craig T Nelson</i> as her lover, <i>Dale</i>, was always a joy.\n  The entire cast - and it\'s a big one counting all the regular supporting parts\n  - was on top form throughout and possibly the highest praise I can offer is\n  that, by the end of the final season, I think I liked every one of the\n  characters more than I had at the start.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Actually, the highest praise I can offer is that I\'d happily watch the whole\n  run again. Which I almost certainly will.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Ted Lasso</i> - Season 1&nbsp;</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d heard a little about this show. I\'d heard it was heart-warming, upbeat and\n  positive. I\'d heard it was <i>nice</i>. I also knew it was about a sports\n  coach and, of course, that it was an American sitcom.&nbsp;When I was looking\n  for something to replace Young Sheldon, it seemed like another sweet slice of\n  Americana to send me off to sleep smiling.\n</p>\n<p>Yeah. About that...</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s not "<i>nice</i>", is it?&nbsp; It\'s not all that sweet either. It\'s\n  acerbic and sharp and occasionally even a little bitter. Ted Lasso (The\n  character no the show.) is irony personified.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For one thing, he may be American and a sports coach but he\'s not in America\n  and he\'s not coaching an American sport. Somehow, in all the things I\'d read,\n  I hadn\'t picked up on the "<i>Sit</i>" in the sitcom, which is that he\'s in\n  London, coaching at a Premier League football club.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Or, rather, managing one, which I\'m not sure they ever actually say. Everyone\n  keeps calling him "<i>Coach</i>" but he\'s doing the job we usually call\n  "<i>Manager</i>" over here and he has an actual coach standing next to him,\n  who everyone also calls "<i>Coach</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The show is full of oddnesses like that. I\'d say it does 98% of a great job of\n  being as convincing about life in modern Britain as 98% of British sitcoms can\n  manage but the 2% differences are wholly different in each case.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The writing doesn\'t actually lean that heavily into the\n  one-language-two-cultures comedy you\'d expect. There\'s plenty of that around\n  the margins but it\'s never the point of the show. Ironically, that makes the\n  moments when cultural infelicities do pop up all the more obvious.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, there\'s some considerable business in several episodes about\n  American sport not accepting a tie as a valid result. Which is fine. Except\n  that we don\'t really use the expression "tie" all that much over here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ted <i>always </i>uses the word "<i>tie</i>" in Season 1. Every British or\n  British-localized speaker he uses it to uses it back to him, frequently when\n  no-one here would ever use the word&nbsp;in that way. We\'d almost always say\n  "<i>draw</i>", which is what we call a sports match where the scores end up\n  tied.&nbsp; We use tie as a verb routinely but rarely as a noun.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, just to make it even more confusing, a "<i>tie</i>" as a noun in a\n  sporting comment usually means a fixture or a match. As in "<i>a cup tie</i>".\n  But then, a draw can be a fixture, too, as in "<i>We got Chelsea in the next round - that\'s a tough draw.</i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I can see how it could be confusing but I\'m not even that into sports and it\'s\n  all just second-nature to me because I grew up here. When the word-choices\n  don\'t ring true, it\'s distracting. And clearly I\'m not the only one who\n  noticed because, in the first episode of Season 2, when ties/draws become a\n  big plot point, both words are used and a context for the different usage is\n  established. It\'s just a shame they didn\'t think of that in Season 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of which might seem like nit-picking but it\'s a real nit-picking kind of\n  show. It\'s full of little bits of business about cultural differences and\n  expectations and about how sports teams operate, all of which revolve around\n  nuances of language and fine details of procedure or practice.\n</p>\n<p>I found all that quite engaging. And enlightening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  For example, a while back, <i>Wilhelm </i>posted something on\n  <i>TAGN </i>about bottled water and I left a comment in which I referred to\n  drinking carbonated bottled water, to which Wilhelm pointed out that Americans\n  generally wouldn\'t see much point in drinking fizzy water - they\'d just drink\n  soda if they wanted fizz.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did not know that. Despite having steeped myself in Americana, second-hand,\n  through comics, books, TV, music and movies since I was a child, I had never\n  come across the idea that sparkling water was un-American. And now here it is\n  as a running gag in Ted Lasso, where he keeps being given glasses of water to\n  drink and he takes a huge swig, expecting it to be plain, then spits it all\n  over himself or someone else because it turns out to be sparkling. Who\n  knew?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s plenty like that but the strength of the show isn\'t so much in the\n  jokes as the characters. Or perhaps I should say the caricatures, which is\n  what they seem like, at least in the first few episodes. It takes a good while\n  before the nuances and subtleties begin to reveal themselves or, I ought to\n  say, are revealed by the writers.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And by the end of the season, I still wasn\'t sure just how much depth lay\n  beneath most of the surfaces. The hints at anything more are so brief, so\n  fleeting, it sometimes felt as though I was imagining them. <i>Keeley </i>is a\n  bit older and smarter than she seems, <i>Coach Beard</i> has some quite\n  peculiar-sounding sexual history, <i>Jamie Tartt</i> has an overbearing dad...\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even as I try to tally those glimpses of character, though, I realize how\n  little is really there. Everything is suggestion, misdirection,\n  sleight-of-hand. After ten episodes, how much do we really know about anyone?\n  Not much more than you could write on an index card.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except, maybe, for Ted. <i>He </i>has some depths and they are, largely,\n  hidden. Not from the audience, who get to see him alone in his apartment at\n  night, but from everyone around him.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To everyone else, he\'s relentlessly upbeat but it doesn\'t seem to have gotten\n  him all that far. He coached one successful season of what I think must have\n  been college football and then got head-hunted by a vengeful divorcee in the\n  expectation his skills would not be transferable and he would be a disaster as\n  the "<i>coach</i>" of a top-flight club in the English Premier League, whose\n  prospects she hoped to damage so as to upset her (Unbearable.) ex.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Meanwhile, that very same relentlessly upbeat tendency is revealed as the\n  proximate cause of Ted\'s own impending divorce. He\'s so fucking nice his wife\n  can\'t stand to be around him any more.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Surprised by that swear-word I just threw in,&nbsp;seemingly so unnecessarily?\n  That\'s the show. It does that All. The. Time. It\'s another thing I wasn\'t\n  expecting. When someone tells you a sitcom is really nice and the main\n  character is really nice and "<i>nice</i>" is the word you hear associated\n  with it more than any other, you\'re probably expecting something along the\n  lines of a live-action <i>Wallace and Grommit. </i>Not a&nbsp;swear-fest.\n  Which is what you get.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a really sweary show. Everyone says "<i>fuck</i>" all the time. Except\n  Ted. Who also says it but only when it matters. Unlike&nbsp;over-the-hill\n  superstar <i>Roy Kent</i>, who has a series of running gags revolving around\n  the F-word, which he uses at every opportunity and in front of anyone\n  including, repeatedly and hilariously, his niece and a bunch of her eight-year\n  old pals. The funniest thing about it is his complete unawareness that it\'s\n  not entirely acceptable behavior. He ends up dropping a bunch of F-bombs in\n  his first post-footballing career gig as a TV pundit, which predictably\n  endears him to the audience, if not the presenters. (Although that\'s at the\n  start of Season 2 so I shouldn\'t mention it here...)\n</p>\n<p>\n  I do like me some good, creative swearing, so it\'s a plus point as far as I\'m\n  concerned. And Roy\'s probably my favorite character, unless that\'s Keeley.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a good show, sweary or not. I\'m not quite convinced it\'s a\n  <i>great </i>show, the way it seems to have been pitched in some of the things\n  I\'ve read about it, but it\'s funny and the characters are likeable and it has\n  that hard-to-resist sports narrative running in the background all the time,\n  where even though it\'s all made up, you still want to know whether the team is\n  going to win or not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just let\'s not talk about the actual footballing scenes. Has any show ever got\n  those right? I doubt it. Some of them here have been quite painful to watch,\n  and as I say I\'m not even a sports fan.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I am a sitcom fan, though, and this is a good one. I\'m on Season 2 now and I\n  notice, looking ahead, that the episodes are longer throughout.

We did\n  pause&nbsp;<i>Netflix </i>for three months but I re-started it for\n  <i>Wednesday </i>(And happily caught the finale of <i>Upload </i>around the\n  same time.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  While I was looking through the schedules for more to watch, so as to get my\n  money\'s-worth, I noticed the missing seasons of couple of shows I had been\n  following a few months ago had miraculously appeared.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  One of them was <i>Roswell: New Mexico,</i> for which Netflix very annoyingly\n  had held the license to Seasons 1 and 2 in the UK but not Seasons 3 and 4,\n  which&nbsp;were exclusive to <i>Sky </i>over here&nbsp;a the time (If I\n  remember right...). That was great but also too late because, when I finished\n  the first two seasons, I didn\'t want to pay yet another sub so I used a VPN to\n  watch them on Netflix USA.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even more annoying was <i>Young Sheldon</i>, for which Netflix had the rights\n  to stream six out of seven seasons in both the UK and the US but no rights to\n  the final season for either. That was on some US station or service I forget\n  now. All I do remember about it was that I couldn\'t watch it, even with a VPN.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, that agreement, whatever it was, must be over now because Netflix has\n  the full run available to stream. I was finally able to catch up with the\n  show. I\'ll tell you what I thought of it later.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Our other streaming service is <i>Amazon Prime </i>but that one pays for\n  itself in shipping alone, particularly since Mrs. Bhagpuss buys at least one\n  thing on <i>Amazon </i>pretty much every day. What with that and the games and\n  music offers included in the bundle, I feel no urge to watch anything on Prime\n  at all if I don\'t feel like it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The problem there is that I also have <i>Apple+</i> through Prime as an\n  add-on. It was very cheap for three months and I didn\'t really care if I was\n  watching anything on Apple+ or not but now it\'s back up to full price it seems\n  like I should at least watch <i>something</i>. Mrs Bhagpuss doesn\'t currently\n  watch anything on the channel at all so it\'s up to me to pick up the\n  slack.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Luckily, there\'s no shortage of good stuff to choose from. I thought about\n  starting several series about which I\'d heard good things -\n  <i>Severance, Slow Horses, Foundation, The Studio</i> - but in the end I\n  decided on <i>Ted Lasso</i>. Main reason: the episodes were shorter. Secondary\n  reason: I like sitcoms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have now watched all of Young Sheldon Season 7 and Ted Lasso Season 1. The\n  end of one story, the start of another. Here\'s what I thought about them both.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Young Sheldon</i> - Season 7</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was quite dubious about the whole concept of Young Sheldon to begin with.\n  I\'ve never been a huge fan of prequels (Is anyone?) and prequels built around\n  main characters as children can come across as a bit desperate. Added to that,\n  this is just one character from an ensemble show, one that relies almost\n  entirely on the particular skills of the specific actor who played him,\n  <i>and </i>it\'s a character often considered to be difficult and\n  controversial.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The prospects didn\'t look good but contrary to expectations it turned out to\n  be a warm, comfortable, enjoyable watch. A lot less spiky and brittle than the\n  show that spawned it, in fact.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, it also had one other, major problem, something common to all\n  long-running shows that revolve around a young child. Children grow up.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In one respect, that worked in Young Sheldon\'s favor. Old Sheldon, if we can\n  call him that, is a divisive figure in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. A lot of\n  people have some very valid objections to the character in terms of the way it\n  can appear to promote and perpetuate some stereotypically negative views of\n  neuro-diversity. I personally feel the full character arc, taken across the\n  entire run of the show, counters many of those objections, producing a nuanced\n  and distinctly positive image of someone struggling with numerous challenges\n  they find it hard to overcome.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if that\'s true, though, you\'d need to have watched the entire 279\n  episodes to appreciate it. And no-one who thinks Sheldon is an offensive\n  caricature is going to sit through 93 hours of a show that makes their skin\n  crawl just to see if maybe it wasn\'t quite as bad as they thought it was after\n  all. As the saying goes, that\'s an awful lot of Shawshank before you get to\n  the Redemption.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I didn\'t think Young Sheldon had the same level of difficulty. In <i>TBBT</i>,\n  there are five central characters and it\'s not hard to make an argument that\n  all of them are potentially offensive in the way they\'re written and\n  performed. Young Sheldon just has... young Sheldon. And he\'s kinda cute.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All those mannerisms and affectations that seem so mannered and performative\n  in an adult seem a lot softer and more relatable in a child. Kids, after all,\n  <i>do </i>say and do<i>&nbsp;</i>the darnedest things, don\'t they? And it is\n  undeniably satisfying, if you\'ve watched a lot of TBBT, to see many of\n  Sheldon\'s tropes and foibles from that show get their start in some specific\n  event in this one, usually for an understandable and sympathetic reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that is in the show as a whole, though. What about the final\n  season?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, the most striking thing about it is that Sheldon isn\'t actually in it\n  all that much. He\'s in every episode but he\'s rarely the central character and\n  the main story arcs seldom revolve around him. He\'s almost a peripheral\n  character at times, chipping in with a few side-stories or popping up to add\n  some extra perspective to someone else\'s story.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, it\'s about his family, all of whom get some significant character\n  development that changes or enhances what we knew about them. For example...\n</p>\n<p>(This bit might get a bit spoilery from here on down...)</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Meemaw </i>really starts to show her age as she loses her home, her\n  business and her freedom all in quick succession. Her veneer of invincibility\n  begins to peel away and her indomitable spirit wilts a little.\n  <i>Missy </i>shows a good deal of unexpected maturity and character growth as\n  does <i>Georgie</i>, albeit each in very different ways. Sheldon\'s mother\'s\n  religious beliefs start to move her closer to the mania seen in the adult\n  show, while his father... dies.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That was a shock, even though if I\'d been counting the passage of time I\nought to have expected it. It happens right towards the end of the run, just\nwhen everything seems to be going pretty well for him and the family.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was not best pleased when it happened, not only because I liked the\n  character as played by <i>Lance Barber</i> but because I had Young Sheldon\n  firmly in my "<i>Send me off to sleep in a good mood</i>." slot and it seemed\n  like it was going to finish with a couple of episodes where all the cast would\n  be in mourning and filled with grief. Not what I want, right before I nod off.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the end, though, the whole thing was handled very gently, not side-stepping\n  the emotions but not losing the warmth and humor either. It was a particularly\n  telling way to show some of Sheldon\'s emotional growth or lack of it, too,\n  something I also thought was well-handled.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As a run, I\'d call Young Sheldon a success. It lasted seven seasons, which is\n  more than decent for a sitcom. It kept the whole cast together and it was\n  consistently written and well-played throughout by an excellent ensemble cast.\n  It was great to see Annie Potts and <i>Ed Begley Jr</i>. in meaty roles again,\n  too.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The underlying problem of child actors turning into adult actors was kept to a\n  minimum by the unusual expedient of partially writing the lead character out\n  of his own show. Missy and Georgie both seemed to age at a rate that allowed\n  the audience barely to notice it happening but by Season 7,<i>\n    Iain Armitage</i>, playing Sheldon, looked very odd indeed, like a much older child playing a\n  much younger one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The same mannerisms that had made him a cute-if-quirky kid turned him into a\n  slightly disturbing adolescent, never changing his expression, keeping his\n  hands stiffly by his sides and always wearing awkwardly formal clothes. That\n  looks funny in an eight-year old but uncomfortable and unsettling in a\n  teenager. It\'s not surprising they mostly wrote around him towards the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The ensemble cast was uniformly excellent. I liked everyone, which is ideal\n  for a sitcom. I especially enjoyed <i>Annie Potts </i>as Meemaw and her double\n  act with <i>Craig T Nelson</i> as her lover, <i>Dale</i>, was always a joy.\n  The entire cast - and it\'s a big one counting all the regular supporting parts\n  - was on top form throughout and possibly the highest praise I can offer is\n  that, by the end of the final season, I think I liked every one of the\n  characters more than I had at the start.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Actually, the highest praise I can offer is that I\'d happily watch the whole\n  run again. Which I almost certainly will.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Ted Lasso</i> - Season 1&nbsp;</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d heard a little about this show. I\'d heard it was heart-warming, upbeat and\n  positive. I\'d heard it was <i>nice</i>. I also knew it was about a sports\n  coach and, of course, that it was an American sitcom.&nbsp;When I was looking\n  for something to replace Young Sheldon, it seemed like another sweet slice of\n  Americana to send me off to sleep smiling.\n</p>\n<p>Yeah. About that...</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s not "<i>nice</i>", is it?&nbsp; It\'s not all that sweet either. It\'s\n  acerbic and sharp and occasionally even a little bitter. Ted Lasso (The\n  character no the show.) is irony personified.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For one thing, he may be American and a sports coach but he\'s not in America\n  and he\'s not coaching an American sport. Somehow, in all the things I\'d read,\n  I hadn\'t picked up on the "<i>Sit</i>" in the sitcom, which is that he\'s in\n  London, coaching at a Premier League football club.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Or, rather, managing one, which I\'m not sure they ever actually say. Everyone\n  keeps calling him "<i>Coach</i>" but he\'s doing the job we usually call\n  "<i>Manager</i>" over here and he has an actual coach standing next to him,\n  who everyone also calls "<i>Coach</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The show is full of oddnesses like that. I\'d say it does 98% of a great job of\n  being as convincing about life in modern Britain as 98% of British sitcoms can\n  manage but the 2% differences are wholly different in each case.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The writing doesn\'t actually lean that heavily into the\n  one-language-two-cultures comedy you\'d expect. There\'s plenty of that around\n  the margins but it\'s never the point of the show. Ironically, that makes the\n  moments when cultural infelicities do pop up all the more obvious.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, there\'s some considerable business in several episodes about\n  American sport not accepting a tie as a valid result. Which is fine. Except\n  that we don\'t really use the expression "tie" all that much over here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ted <i>always </i>uses the word "<i>tie</i>" in Season 1. Every British or\n  British-localized speaker he uses it to uses it back to him, frequently when\n  no-one here would ever use the word&nbsp;in that way. We\'d almost always say\n  "<i>draw</i>", which is what we call a sports match where the scores end up\n  tied.&nbsp; We use tie as a verb routinely but rarely as a noun.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, just to make it even more confusing, a "<i>tie</i>" as a noun in a\n  sporting comment usually means a fixture or a match. As in "<i>a cup tie</i>".\n  But then, a draw can be a fixture, too, as in "<i>We got Chelsea in the next round - that\'s a tough draw.</i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I can see how it could be confusing but I\'m not even that into sports and it\'s\n  all just second-nature to me because I grew up here. When the word-choices\n  don\'t ring true, it\'s distracting. And clearly I\'m not the only one who\n  noticed because, in the first episode of Season 2, when ties/draws become a\n  big plot point, both words are used and a context for the different usage is\n  established. It\'s just a shame they didn\'t think of that in Season 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of which might seem like nit-picking but it\'s a real nit-picking kind of\n  show. It\'s full of little bits of business about cultural differences and\n  expectations and about how sports teams operate, all of which revolve around\n  nuances of language and fine details of procedure or practice.\n</p>\n<p>I found all that quite engaging. And enlightening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  For example, a while back, <i>Wilhelm </i>posted something on\n  <i>TAGN </i>about bottled water and I left a comment in which I referred to\n  drinking carbonated bottled water, to which Wilhelm pointed out that Americans\n  generally wouldn\'t see much point in drinking fizzy water - they\'d just drink\n  soda if they wanted fizz.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did not know that. Despite having steeped myself in Americana, second-hand,\n  through comics, books, TV, music and movies since I was a child, I had never\n  come across the idea that sparkling water was un-American. And now here it is\n  as a running gag in Ted Lasso, where he keeps being given glasses of water to\n  drink and he takes a huge swig, expecting it to be plain, then spits it all\n  over himself or someone else because it turns out to be sparkling. Who\n  knew?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s plenty like that but the strength of the show isn\'t so much in the\n  jokes as the characters. Or perhaps I should say the caricatures, which is\n  what they seem like, at least in the first few episodes. It takes a good while\n  before the nuances and subtleties begin to reveal themselves or, I ought to\n  say, are revealed by the writers.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And by the end of the season, I still wasn\'t sure just how much depth lay\n  beneath most of the surfaces. The hints at anything more are so brief, so\n  fleeting, it sometimes felt as though I was imagining them. <i>Keeley </i>is a\n  bit older and smarter than she seems, <i>Coach Beard</i> has some quite\n  peculiar-sounding sexual history, <i>Jamie Tartt</i> has an overbearing dad...\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even as I try to tally those glimpses of character, though, I realize how\n  little is really there. Everything is suggestion, misdirection,\n  sleight-of-hand. After ten episodes, how much do we really know about anyone?\n  Not much more than you could write on an index card.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except, maybe, for Ted. <i>He </i>has some depths and they are, largely,\n  hidden. Not from the audience, who get to see him alone in his apartment at\n  night, but from everyone around him.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To everyone else, he\'s relentlessly upbeat but it doesn\'t seem to have gotten\n  him all that far. He coached one successful season of what I think must have\n  been college football and then got head-hunted by a vengeful divorcee in the\n  expectation his skills would not be transferable and he would be a disaster as\n  the "<i>coach</i>" of a top-flight club in the English Premier League, whose\n  prospects she hoped to damage so as to upset her (Unbearable.) ex.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Meanwhile, that very same relentlessly upbeat tendency is revealed as the\n  proximate cause of Ted\'s own impending divorce. He\'s so fucking nice his wife\n  can\'t stand to be around him any more.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Surprised by that swear-word I just threw in,&nbsp;seemingly so unnecessarily?\n  That\'s the show. It does that All. The. Time. It\'s another thing I wasn\'t\n  expecting. When someone tells you a sitcom is really nice and the main\n  character is really nice and "<i>nice</i>" is the word you hear associated\n  with it more than any other, you\'re probably expecting something along the\n  lines of a live-action <i>Wallace and Grommit. </i>Not a&nbsp;swear-fest.\n  Which is what you get.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a really sweary show. Everyone says "<i>fuck</i>" all the time. Except\n  Ted. Who also says it but only when it matters. Unlike&nbsp;over-the-hill\n  superstar <i>Roy Kent</i>, who has a series of running gags revolving around\n  the F-word, which he uses at every opportunity and in front of anyone\n  including, repeatedly and hilariously, his niece and a bunch of her eight-year\n  old pals. The funniest thing about it is his complete unawareness that it\'s\n  not entirely acceptable behavior. He ends up dropping a bunch of F-bombs in\n  his first post-footballing career gig as a TV pundit, which predictably\n  endears him to the audience, if not the presenters. (Although that\'s at the\n  start of Season 2 so I shouldn\'t mention it here...)\n</p>\n<p>\n  I do like me some good, creative swearing, so it\'s a plus point as far as I\'m\n  concerned. And Roy\'s probably my favorite character, unless that\'s Keeley.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a good show, sweary or not. I\'m not quite convinced it\'s a\n  <i>great </i>show, the way it seems to have been pitched in some of the things\n  I\'ve read about it, but it\'s funny and the characters are likeable and it has\n  that hard-to-resist sports narrative running in the background all the time,\n  where even though it\'s all made up, you still want to know whether the team is\n  going to win or not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just let\'s not talk about the actual footballing scenes. Has any show ever got\n  those right? I doubt it. Some of them here have been quite painful to watch,\n  and as I say I\'m not even a sports fan.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I am a sitcom fan, though, and this is a good one. I\'m on Season 2 now and I\n  notice, looking ahead, that the episodes are longer throughout. I\'m guessing\n  that means more plot and deeper characterization rather than more jokes but\n  I\'ll be happy, either way.\n</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/beginnings-and-endings.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/beginnings-and-endings.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKqBRN0umxps8SeA9OiEEcvgVRybKVRUahkxtHEfGt7iHDjMn_3zYVQ6wm3yRe3QDq4eeAowjxS2lIBI13qdE2jSDsaHiQFVFNBckcXV9tfcTZRMELR40ch6dFjmqB1t2CQ9LBlwp6QIUALBhEvQ2fuysMlhQrZg8P6Z7n-SZp6lC7BxAq5GAXEP5Gg_U/s72-w640-h394-c/tls11.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

In Once Human it\'s <i>Deviants</i>. Pals roam around your\n  home. Deviants roam around your home. Pals come with you and fight stuff.\n  Deviants come with you and fight stuff.

Luckily for <i>Starry</i>, the studio behind Once Human, they didn\'t make it so you have you catch Deviants by throwing small spheres at them from a distance. No, you\n<i>  walk </i>up to the Deviant, which is <i>already </i>inside a sphere, and you catch\n  it by holding up your hand, which is <i>entirely </i>different.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not clear on whether the&nbsp; event is a one-way deal, with Pals\n  appearing in Once Human but not the other way around, or whether Deviants will also be popping up in\n  Palworld. Even if it\'s the latter, I doubt very much it would be enough to induce\n  me to go back, even for a visit.

Or "<i>Pre-Register</i>" as they put it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I mean, who wouldn\'t, after watching <i>this</i>?</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That\'s seven minutes of action I find hard to believe is taken directly\nfrom the game. But it is, apparently. Obviously it\'s been edited but as far as I\ncan tell everything you see is gameplay footage.\n<p></p>\n<p>And so is this, which just landed on <i>YouTube</i>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That\'s ten minutes of "<i>Official Extended Gameplay</i>" that\nabsolutely looks like a movie. Specifically, the center-piece car chase from a\npretty good movie. A movie I would certainly watch.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  My question isn\'t "<i>Is this game going to be any good?</i>" or "<i>Will it be Pay-to-Win</i>?" or any of those obvious things gamers always ask. It\'s not even "<i>Will it run on my aging PC?</i>", although that\'s a valid concern.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, my question is "<i>How the hell is that even possible?</i>" Apart from the\n  oddly stilted walking animations, the video looks like a bunch of clips from a movie.\n  <i>MOP </i>described it as a "<i>sizzle reel</i>" and that\'s really what it\n  is.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  After watching it, I found myself thinking back to something that happened more than thirty years ago, which I\'ve never forgotten. I happened to go into large store in a nearby city and I was walking through\n  the electronics department when I saw, on a large screen (For those days.), a video\n  game playing. It was a castle in a fantasy forest and it looked like just a movie.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never found out what the game was or what it was running on and I can\'t even remember now how I knew it was a game not a film. I\'m pretty\n  sure if I could see it now it would look like something you\'d see in\n  a&nbsp;<i>PS1</i>game. It probably <i>was </i>a PS1 game. It would have been around that time. Whatever it was, it looked like the future. Well, it looked like the past, what with it being a fantasy castle and all, but the past seen through the lens of the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/s1280/anantagirl2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/w640-h448/anantagirl2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Technologically, we are all living in the future now and we take it for granted.\n  Things we pay no attention to or even get anoyed by today would have seemed like literal, actual magic just thirty years ago. If I find it hard to believe something\n  like Ananta can even be real today, imagine how I\'d have felt if I could have watched that trailer\n  in 1995!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Something I hear often these days is that improved graphics can only take the\n  games industry so far and that the limit may already have been reached. And that\'s\n  probably true, as far as it goes. But what\'s hard to believe about this\n  trailer isn\'t so much the visual quality, impressive though it is; it\'s the world-building.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what draws me in to all of these new games, all these new worlds, from\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i> to <i>Neverness To Everness</i> to Ananta: their\n  cinematic, novelistic storytelling. I see clips and I want to know who the\n  characters are, what their lives are like, what they\'re doing. It\'s not new\n  but it <i>seems </i>like it\'s new. It\'s the new future of our long, storytelling past.</p>\n<p>\n  Also, someone\'s bound to be wearing bunny ears in one of these things and that\'s always a\n  bonus. I\'d say you don\'t see <i>that </i>in real life but I saw two people wearing bunny ears in the street only this week...\n</p>\n<p>\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>On MMORPGs And Why They\'re Kinda Done</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  As big, mass-market affairs, that is. Not as small to medium sized niche services\n  servicing small to medium size niches. They\'re still good there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was\n  <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/#comment-330459"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">something <i>Redbeard </i>said</span></a>\n  in response to <i>Wilhelm</i>\'s post about <i>Ship of Heroes</i> yesterday\n  that started me thinking. For some reason, the conversation took a detour\n  into<i> Guild Wars 2 </i>and how a big part of the revenue system there relies\n  on persuading players to part with cash to remove the inconveniences the devs\n  have added in, seemingly for that exact purpose.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a well-known mechanic in many MMOs. The very unpopular version is to put\n  up obvious pay-walls for in-game services and systems most players believe\n  should be part of the core gameplay. <i>Star Wars: the Old Republic</i> used\n  to be the leader in that awkward field, charging money for everything up to\n  and including enough hot bars to fit your skills.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They toned that down over time and recently they\'ve cut it right back to\n  something closer to what players expected in the first place. It still leaves\n  a whole lot of less controversial money-making opportunities in place, though,\n  one of which is always storage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>GW2 </i>has always had a serious storage problem. The game isn\'t overly\n  generous with inventory space to begin with but it does allow you to expand it\n  in various ways, all of which are technically free. As Redbeard points out,\n  though, its much, much easier to get out your credit card and pay.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never did and that\'s because I played GW2 like an old-school MMORPG. I played for a decade, virtually every day, often for several hours at a time. Just playing normally and not spending any real money, I ended up with a huge amount of\n  inventory space across multiple accounts and characters. On my most-played\n  characters I had all the bag and bank slots you were allowed. I hit the point\n  where even real money wouldn\'t have gotten me any more and I hadn\'t paid a\n  dime.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/s307/gw2leg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="367" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/w640-h367/gw2leg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  It still wasn\'t enough. I made bigger bags and <i>that </i>wasn\'t enough. Nothing was\n<i>  ever </i>enough. GW2 doesn\'t just have a storage problem, it has a loot problem.\n  There\'s far, far, far too much of it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is also the key to <i>not </i>spending any money on storage. You have the\n  choice, as Wilhelm suggests, of just throwing everything away. That\'ll fix it\n  for free and right away. Or you can sell all of the good stuff you find and use the\n  gold to buy Gems, the cash shop currency, then use those Gems to buy more\n  storage space, which is what I did.\n</p>\n<p>\n  People complain all the time about not being able to make enough gold in GW2.\n  I made thousands, easily. I still have most of it because I made far more than I ever needed. I didn\'t make any special effort, either. I had\n  just two tricks for making gold:\n</p>\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\n  <li>\n    <b>Never, ever make any Legendaries. Sell all the mats for them you find to to those who do.</b></li>\n  <li><b>Play every hour god sends</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The first isn\'t a problem. It\'s just sensible. No-one needs Legendary items in\n  GW2. They do nothing for gameplay. They\'re convenience items and cosmetics. Let others waste their time and pay you for the privilege.</p>\n<p>\n  The second is the reason MMORPGs are and always will be a niche interest. They absolutely do not respect your time.&nbsp;</p><p>Redbeard has inventory problems he can only, rationally, solve by paying real\n  money because he doesn\'t play GW2 several hours a day, every day, year in, year out. If he did,\n  the problem would solve itself, at least until there were no more slots left to\n  buy with all that gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All MMORPGs are designed to be played for several hours a day, every day,\n  forever. That\'s the business model. The reason the genre is being lapped\n  by open-world RPGs and survival games is that those offer the same level\n  of intensity and immersion that made MMORPGs successful in the first place but they don\'t go on forever and ever and ever like an\n  eternal treadmill. They don\'t necessarily come with a Game Over title card but they\n  have clear end-points that feel like a satisfying place to stop. And they have clear on-ramps every\n  time they add DLC or major updates, meaning you can dip in and out without worrying about falling far behind.</p>\n<p>\n  Or something. It\'s a theory. I haven\'t really thought it through. Feel free to elaborate and iterate on it.</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">AI Ruins Everything</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s made a lot of people happy, I bet. I don\'t mean that it does. I mean that I said it. Do I mean it, though? Depends what you mean by "<i>AI</i>", doesn\'t it?</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Greg Morris</i>, whose blog I picked up in Blaugust, has\n  <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2025/09/24/i-did-it-myself.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a good take</span></a>\n  on it. He, like me, isn\'t existentially opposed to AI. He sees some merits\n  and uses, as do I. He\'s just not very impressed with what people are doing\n  with it just now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  "<i>Widespread usage of generative products, particularly ChatGPT, by many\n    people I come in contact with is making my life more difficult</i>" he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, mine too. All of ours, I bet.\n</p>\n<p>Like Greg, I am not as sanguine as I could be about my doctor\'s surgery\n  moving to an AI triage system. Neither am I convinced that having AI answer\n  the phone when I call to try and buy something is the best way of\n  handling a commercial transaction. Unlike Greg, I\'m happy to say I don\'t\n  encounter AI in my work although no doubt it\'s only a matter of time, but I\n  have very low confidence in any of the current LLMs being able to send emails\n  that wouldn\'t have gotten me into trouble if I\'d written them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What I do think, perhaps over-optimistically, is that the AIs will either\n  have to get a lot better or most of the companies and services that have\n  adopted them so quickly will have to drop them again pretty quickly too, probably\n  as soon as they notice how much money they\'re losing and how many lawsuits\n  they\'re picking up. Those No Win No Fee lawyers must just <i>love </i>AI.</p>\n<p>\n  This is all LLMs, though. They\'re the bad AIs. Generative AI as a whole may be\n  morally and ethically bad but only some of it is practically bad, too. The real problem with the rest is that it\'s getting to be too\n  good at what it does.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/s512/wtcf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/w640-h640/wtcf1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'ve been a fan of line art since I was a child. I\'ve spent well over half\n  a century developing a fairly well-trained eye and a reasonably informed,\n  historical understanding of line art and illustration, particularly comics. I\n  have a reliably-formatted emotional and aesthetic reaction to every such image I see that allows me to parse it and contextualize it by way of decades of exposure.</p>\n<p>\n  And I like some of the AI images I\'m seeing these days as well as or better than many, many similar\n  pictures I\'ve seen that were drawn by humans. Humans draw a lot of really bad line art and a lot of them don\'t know how bad it is.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn\'t matter if I know an image is by AI, either. It doesn\'t put me off. The image is the image (cf. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/intentional-fallacy"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Intentional Fallacy,</span></a> as always.) It\'s not\n  like I\'m being tricked into thinking a human did it. AI images of a certain\n  kind stimulate the same level of endorphin production or synaptic snap or whatever it is that\n  makes me look at a line drawing and get a warm, tingly feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Doubly so if\n  it\'s one I\'ve caused to be made myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If I was making my living by drawing pictures, that would piss me off. Or\n  maybe it wouldn\'t. Maybe I\'d just see AI as a new kind of pencil and start drawing with it. At the moment, there\'s resistance to commissioned AI art but will\n  that attitude last? In the end, don\'t people mostly want the right image for\n  the purpose they\'ve commissioned it? Is the provenance of the picture that important? And if your primary (Or ancillary.) motivation is to give work to the artist, does that have anything at all to do with aesthetics?</p>\n<p>\n  To some people, yes, obviously. But to the mass market? I doubt it. And I was\n  never going to commission anyone to draw anything anyway so it\'s a moot point\n  as far as my money is concerned.\n</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>\n  The same applies to generative AI and music, another field where I can claim a\n  longstanding interest. Or at least it applies to music <i>I\'ve</i> made with\n  AI, which I currently prefer to listen to over almost anything else.&nbsp;\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/s894/aihg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/w640-h448/aihg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  I have to say that I have yet to hear anything <i>made </i>by anyone else using AI that has\n  the same impact. Most of it is horrible. But I suspect that says more about\n  the musical tastes of the people who are making it than the capacity and\n  potential of the AIs. When people who like the kind of music I like start\n  making music with AI, I\'m pretty sure I\'ll find plenty to enjoy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Always assuming I even know, that is. If people don\'t say they used AI, who\'s going to know?&nbsp;</p><p>There are some free apps around that\n  purport to be able to tell if a song has been made by AI or not. I tried a\n  couple. I\'d give you the links but I forgot to bookmark them.</p>\n<p>\n  One is extremely accurate but that one works by analyzing the frequencies of the\n  sample you submit rather than trying to make any aesthetic judgments. It\'s undeniable that AI has a particular sonic signature you can hear once your ear attunes to it and there\'s a technical accuracy to the timing that human musicians don\'t always\n  achieve. I imagine that could be coded out if the people making AI wanted to\n  hide it.&nbsp;</p><p>That app, unsurprisingly, pegged everything I sent it as having been made by AI. Which it was. I should have dummied it with some human music but I was just dicking around, not running some kind of double-blind experiment.</p>\n<p>\n  The other app, which attempts something more along the lines of a critical analysis, looking at things like the structure and the lyrics as well as the music, was much less certain whether an AI was involved or not. It tended to\n  think most of the songs I was sending it were mostly done by a human.&nbsp;</p><p>And so\n  they were. I wrote all the words. I came up with all the melodies. I gave the\n  AI a guide vocal, which I made sure the AI followed very closely. In my opinion, those songs were indeed made by a human. A human using AI as an instrument.</p>\n<p>I suspect most of the AI music being made doesn\'t have that degree of human input behind it, though. An astonishing amount of AI music is being uploaded to streaming sites every\n  day. Millions of songs. Almost all of them made purely by AI from a short prompt.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see why the platforms might want to filter it\n  out.

She\n    shares the house and garden with a girl in her late teens called Cat, a\n    young woman of indefinable age called Cathy and a woman in her early\n    thirties called Rachel. Phoebe has never left the house and garden. She has\n    no memories of ever being anywhere else. She thinks she had a brother but\n    she doesn\'t really remember him. She reads, plays chess with Cat, and just\n    generally gets through the day. She believes Cat and Cathy are ghosts. She\n    believes she\'s a half-ghost. She believes Rachel is fully real. Cat is\n    friendly and kind to her. Cathy is drifty and vague but unafraid of anything\n    and protective of Phoebe. Rachel is often angry because she wants to leave\n    to get back to her friends, about whom she often talks, but she doesn\'t know\n    how to leave. Rachel, when she\'s in a good mood, creates firework displays\n    and makes snow fall so she and Phoebe can build snow statues of Rachel\'s\n    absent friends. One day, after this has been going on for a long time, two\n    of Rachel\'s friends, Sally and Cado Babe, appear in the garden and soon\n    after they and Rachel are gone.

Specifically, the center-piece car chase from a\npretty good movie. A movie I would certainly watch.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  My question isn\'t "<i>Is this game going to be any good?</i>" or "<i>Will it be Pay-to-Win</i>?" or any of those obvious things gamers always ask. It\'s not even "<i>Will it run on my aging PC?</i>", although that\'s a valid concern.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, my question is "<i>How the hell is that even possible?</i>" Apart from the\n  oddly stilted walking animations, the video looks like a bunch of clips from a movie.\n  <i>MOP </i>described it as a "<i>sizzle reel</i>" and that\'s really what it\n  is.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  After watching it, I found myself thinking back to something that happened more than thirty years ago, which I\'ve never forgotten. I happened to go into large store in a nearby city and I was walking through\n  the electronics department when I saw, on a large screen (For those days.), a video\n  game playing. It was a castle in a fantasy forest and it looked like just a movie.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never found out what the game was or what it was running on and I can\'t even remember now how I knew it was a game not a film. I\'m pretty\n  sure if I could see it now it would look like something you\'d see in\n  a&nbsp;<i>PS1</i>game. It probably <i>was </i>a PS1 game. It would have been around that time. Whatever it was, it looked like the future. Well, it looked like the past, what with it being a fantasy castle and all, but the past seen through the lens of the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/s1280/anantagirl2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/w640-h448/anantagirl2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Technologically, we are all living in the future now and we take it for granted.\n  Things we pay no attention to or even get anoyed by today would have seemed like literal, actual magic just thirty years ago. If I find it hard to believe something\n  like Ananta can even be real today, imagine how I\'d have felt if I could have watched that trailer\n  in 1995!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Something I hear often these days is that improved graphics can only take the\n  games industry so far and that the limit may already have been reached. And that\'s\n  probably true, as far as it goes. But what\'s hard to believe about this\n  trailer isn\'t so much the visual quality, impressive though it is; it\'s the world-building.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what draws me in to all of these new games, all these new worlds, from\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i> to <i>Neverness To Everness</i> to Ananta: their\n  cinematic, novelistic storytelling. I see clips and I want to know who the\n  characters are, what their lives are like, what they\'re doing. It\'s not new\n  but it <i>seems </i>like it\'s new. It\'s the new future of our long, storytelling past.</p>\n<p>\n  Also, someone\'s bound to be wearing bunny ears in one of these things and that\'s always a\n  bonus. I\'d say you don\'t see <i>that </i>in real life but I saw two people wearing bunny ears in the street only this week...\n</p>\n<p>\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>On MMORPGs And Why They\'re Kinda Done</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  As big, mass-market affairs, that is. Not as small to medium sized niche services\n  servicing small to medium size niches. They\'re still good there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was\n  <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/#comment-330459"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">something <i>Redbeard </i>said</span></a>\n  in response to <i>Wilhelm</i>\'s post about <i>Ship of Heroes</i> yesterday\n  that started me thinking. For some reason, the conversation took a detour\n  into<i> Guild Wars 2 </i>and how a big part of the revenue system there relies\n  on persuading players to part with cash to remove the inconveniences the devs\n  have added in, seemingly for that exact purpose.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a well-known mechanic in many MMOs. The very unpopular version is to put\n  up obvious pay-walls for in-game services and systems most players believe\n  should be part of the core gameplay. <i>Star Wars: the Old Republic</i> used\n  to be the leader in that awkward field, charging money for everything up to\n  and including enough hot bars to fit your skills.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They toned that down over time and recently they\'ve cut it right back to\n  something closer to what players expected in the first place. It still leaves\n  a whole lot of less controversial money-making opportunities in place, though,\n  one of which is always storage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>GW2 </i>has always had a serious storage problem. The game isn\'t overly\n  generous with inventory space to begin with but it does allow you to expand it\n  in various ways, all of which are technically free. As Redbeard points out,\n  though, its much, much easier to get out your credit card and pay.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never did and that\'s because I played GW2 like an old-school MMORPG. I played for a decade, virtually every day, often for several hours at a time. Just playing normally and not spending any real money, I ended up with a huge amount of\n  inventory space across multiple accounts and characters. On my most-played\n  characters I had all the bag and bank slots you were allowed. I hit the point\n  where even real money wouldn\'t have gotten me any more and I hadn\'t paid a\n  dime.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/s307/gw2leg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="367" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/w640-h367/gw2leg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  It still wasn\'t enough. I made bigger bags and <i>that </i>wasn\'t enough. Nothing was\n<i>  ever </i>enough. GW2 doesn\'t just have a storage problem, it has a loot problem.\n  There\'s far, far, far too much of it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is also the key to <i>not </i>spending any money on storage. You have the\n  choice, as Wilhelm suggests, of just throwing everything away. That\'ll fix it\n  for free and right away. Or you can sell all of the good stuff you find and use the\n  gold to buy Gems, the cash shop currency, then use those Gems to buy more\n  storage space, which is what I did.\n</p>\n<p>\n  People complain all the time about not being able to make enough gold in GW2.\n  I made thousands, easily. I still have most of it because I made far more than I ever needed. I didn\'t make any special effort, either. I had\n  just two tricks for making gold:\n</p>\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\n  <li>\n    <b>Never, ever make any Legendaries. Sell all the mats for them you find to to those who do.</b></li>\n  <li><b>Play every hour god sends</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The first isn\'t a problem. It\'s just sensible. No-one needs Legendary items in\n  GW2. They do nothing for gameplay. They\'re convenience items and cosmetics. Let others waste their time and pay you for the privilege.</p>\n<p>\n  The second is the reason MMORPGs are and always will be a niche interest. They absolutely do not respect your time.&nbsp;</p><p>Redbeard has inventory problems he can only, rationally, solve by paying real\n  money because he doesn\'t play GW2 several hours a day, every day, year in, year out. If he did,\n  the problem would solve itself, at least until there were no more slots left to\n  buy with all that gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All MMORPGs are designed to be played for several hours a day, every day,\n  forever. That\'s the business model. The reason the genre is being lapped\n  by open-world RPGs and survival games is that those offer the same level\n  of intensity and immersion that made MMORPGs successful in the first place but they don\'t go on forever and ever and ever like an\n  eternal treadmill. They don\'t necessarily come with a Game Over title card but they\n  have clear end-points that feel like a satisfying place to stop. And they have clear on-ramps every\n  time they add DLC or major updates, meaning you can dip in and out without worrying about falling far behind.</p>\n<p>\n  Or something. It\'s a theory. I haven\'t really thought it through. Feel free to elaborate and iterate on it.</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">AI Ruins Everything</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s made a lot of people happy, I bet. I don\'t mean that it does. I mean that I said it. Do I mean it, though? Depends what you mean by "<i>AI</i>", doesn\'t it?</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Greg Morris</i>, whose blog I picked up in Blaugust, has\n  <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2025/09/24/i-did-it-myself.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a good take</span></a>\n  on it. He, like me, isn\'t existentially opposed to AI. He sees some merits\n  and uses, as do I. He\'s just not very impressed with what people are doing\n  with it just now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  "<i>Widespread usage of generative products, particularly ChatGPT, by many\n    people I come in contact with is making my life more difficult</i>" he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, mine too. All of ours, I bet.\n</p>\n<p>Like Greg, I am not as sanguine as I could be about my doctor\'s surgery\n  moving to an AI triage system. Neither am I convinced that having AI answer\n  the phone when I call to try and buy something is the best way of\n  handling a commercial transaction. Unlike Greg, I\'m happy to say I don\'t\n  encounter AI in my work although no doubt it\'s only a matter of time, but I\n  have very low confidence in any of the current LLMs being able to send emails\n  that wouldn\'t have gotten me into trouble if I\'d written them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What I do think, perhaps over-optimistically, is that the AIs will either\n  have to get a lot better or most of the companies and services that have\n  adopted them so quickly will have to drop them again pretty quickly too, probably\n  as soon as they notice how much money they\'re losing and how many lawsuits\n  they\'re picking up. Those No Win No Fee lawyers must just <i>love </i>AI.</p>\n<p>\n  This is all LLMs, though. They\'re the bad AIs. Generative AI as a whole may be\n  morally and ethically bad but only some of it is practically bad, too. The real problem with the rest is that it\'s getting to be too\n  good at what it does.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/s512/wtcf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/w640-h640/wtcf1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'ve been a fan of line art since I was a child. I\'ve spent well over half\n  a century developing a fairly well-trained eye and a reasonably informed,\n  historical understanding of line art and illustration, particularly comics. I\n  have a reliably-formatted emotional and aesthetic reaction to every such image I see that allows me to parse it and contextualize it by way of decades of exposure.</p>\n<p>\n  And I like some of the AI images I\'m seeing these days as well as or better than many, many similar\n  pictures I\'ve seen that were drawn by humans. Humans draw a lot of really bad line art and a lot of them don\'t know how bad it is.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn\'t matter if I know an image is by AI, either. It doesn\'t put me off. The image is the image (cf. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/intentional-fallacy"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Intentional Fallacy,</span></a> as always.) It\'s not\n  like I\'m being tricked into thinking a human did it. AI images of a certain\n  kind stimulate the same level of endorphin production or synaptic snap or whatever it is that\n  makes me look at a line drawing and get a warm, tingly feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Doubly so if\n  it\'s one I\'ve caused to be made myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If I was making my living by drawing pictures, that would piss me off. Or\n  maybe it wouldn\'t. Maybe I\'d just see AI as a new kind of pencil and start drawing with it. At the moment, there\'s resistance to commissioned AI art but will\n  that attitude last? In the end, don\'t people mostly want the right image for\n  the purpose they\'ve commissioned it? Is the provenance of the picture that important? And if your primary (Or ancillary.) motivation is to give work to the artist, does that have anything at all to do with aesthetics?</p>\n<p>\n  To some people, yes, obviously. But to the mass market? I doubt it. And I was\n  never going to commission anyone to draw anything anyway so it\'s a moot point\n  as far as my money is concerned.\n</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>\n  The same applies to generative AI and music, another field where I can claim a\n  longstanding interest. Or at least it applies to music <i>I\'ve</i> made with\n  AI, which I currently prefer to listen to over almost anything else.&nbsp;\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/s894/aihg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/w640-h448/aihg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  I have to say that I have yet to hear anything <i>made </i>by anyone else using AI that has\n  the same impact. Most of it is horrible. But I suspect that says more about\n  the musical tastes of the people who are making it than the capacity and\n  potential of the AIs. When people who like the kind of music I like start\n  making music with AI, I\'m pretty sure I\'ll find plenty to enjoy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Always assuming I even know, that is. If people don\'t say they used AI, who\'s going to know?&nbsp;</p><p>There are some free apps around that\n  purport to be able to tell if a song has been made by AI or not. I tried a\n  couple. I\'d give you the links but I forgot to bookmark them.</p>\n<p>\n  One is extremely accurate but that one works by analyzing the frequencies of the\n  sample you submit rather than trying to make any aesthetic judgments. It\'s undeniable that AI has a particular sonic signature you can hear once your ear attunes to it and there\'s a technical accuracy to the timing that human musicians don\'t always\n  achieve. I imagine that could be coded out if the people making AI wanted to\n  hide it.&nbsp;</p><p>That app, unsurprisingly, pegged everything I sent it as having been made by AI. Which it was. I should have dummied it with some human music but I was just dicking around, not running some kind of double-blind experiment.</p>\n<p>\n  The other app, which attempts something more along the lines of a critical analysis, looking at things like the structure and the lyrics as well as the music, was much less certain whether an AI was involved or not. It tended to\n  think most of the songs I was sending it were mostly done by a human.&nbsp;</p><p>And so\n  they were. I wrote all the words. I came up with all the melodies. I gave the\n  AI a guide vocal, which I made sure the AI followed very closely. In my opinion, those songs were indeed made by a human. A human using AI as an instrument.</p>\n<p>I suspect most of the AI music being made doesn\'t have that degree of human input behind it, though. An astonishing amount of AI music is being uploaded to streaming sites every\n  day. Millions of songs. Almost all of them made purely by AI from a short prompt.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see why the platforms might want to filter it\n  out. Except, if their customers are happily listening to it, why would they\n  bother?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Bad pushes out good is the old saw.

It\'s rather better, I hope you\'ll agree.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Notes on AI Used in this post</b></p>\n<p>\n  Some of this is explained in the text but to be clear, the final image is from\n  Gemini\'s newish storybook feature. The full prompt for the whole thing was an\n  ad hoc precis of a whole series of fictional pieces I published in an APA back\n  in the 90s. At some point I will be posting the originals, complete with the\n  infinitely superior full text and collaged illustrations, so if you have any\n  interest, you might want to wait for that:\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;"<i>Please make me a picture book for adults about a girl called Phoebe, aged\n    about 12 or 13, who lives in a rambling old house with a walled garden. She\n    shares the house and garden with a girl in her late teens called Cat, a\n    young woman of indefinable age called Cathy and a woman in her early\n    thirties called Rachel. Phoebe has never left the house and garden. She has\n    no memories of ever being anywhere else. She thinks she had a brother but\n    she doesn\'t really remember him. She reads, plays chess with Cat, and just\n    generally gets through the day. She believes Cat and Cathy are ghosts. She\n    believes she\'s a half-ghost. She believes Rachel is fully real. Cat is\n    friendly and kind to her. Cathy is drifty and vague but unafraid of anything\n    and protective of Phoebe. Rachel is often angry because she wants to leave\n    to get back to her friends, about whom she often talks, but she doesn\'t know\n    how to leave. Rachel, when she\'s in a good mood, creates firework displays\n    and makes snow fall so she and Phoebe can build snow statues of Rachel\'s\n    absent friends. One day, after this has been going on for a long time, two\n    of Rachel\'s friends, Sally and Cado Babe, appear in the garden and soon\n    after they and Rachel are gone. Phoebe is left on her own with Cat and\n    Cathy. She wonders now if she, too, will ever leave. </i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The header image and the second one were both done with Google\'s\n  <i>Imagen 4.0</i> at NightCafe. For some reason, instead of taking a couple of\n  screenshots from the Ananta videos, I thought it would be amusing to have an\n  AI make them instead. The prompt for the top image was "<i>An anime girl dressed in blue with bunny ears riding in an electric blue\n    sports car along a freeway between the towering skyscrapers of a near-future\n    city. Bright sunshine, blue sky. Anime line art, bright flat\n    colors.</i>" For the second, I used the same prompt but added "<i>A dark-haired young man wearing sunglasses is beside her in the passenger\n    seat.</i>" All settings were left on whatever the defaults are.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The third image is one of the daily pictures I\'m still producing to keep my\n  NightCafe streak going.

There is! Here\'s how you do it...</p>\n<p>\n  Charge $60 for the (Non-existent.) box <i>and </i>demand&nbsp;fifteen dollars\n  a month to keep on playing after the first thirty days! That ought to do it!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ah, but is it enough? If your game is <i>really </i>good and has fantastic\n  word of mouth and the streamers are all plugging it like crazy and you\'ve\n  picked out a spot in the market where there\'s no direct competition, maybe\n  you\'ll still find yourself overwhelmed by hordes of frantic players throwing\n  money at you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, just to be safe, why not go head-to-head with the free-to-play game that\n  inspired the one you just spent years on? And why not make sure your\n  AAA-priced version of that familiar title looks like "<i>a relic of a bygone era</i>", specifically "<i>the early 00\'s</i>". Make sure it\'s "<i>worse than games released 2 decades ago</i>" and be sure it plays&nbsp;"<i>like a student project or an alpha build with a bunch of placeholders for\n    real icons, graphics, sound effects, systems, and so on</i>".&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not my words, just a few choice quotes from the <i>Steam </i>reviews, where\n  <i>Ship of Heroes</i> (Aww - you guessed...) is currently enjoying a rating of\n  <i>Mostly Negative </i>from forty-eight reviews.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And since everyone really <i>loves </i>AI these days, especially gamers, why\n  not use it instead of actual actors for your NPC voice acting? That last\n  allegation appears to have been disputed by the developers but the general\n  impression is that the voice acting is "<i>awful</i>" no matter whether humans\n  or machines are doing it, so it probably doesn\'t matter much either way.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that in place (And a lot more besides.) it\'s safe to assume your\n  players won\'t run into any of those all-too-familiar launch day issues. Your\n  servers will almost certainly be able to withstand the strain of the teens of\n  people willing to stump up the cost of<i> Baldurs Gate 3 </i>for a chance to\n  play "<i>a buggy mess</i>" for a month before having to get their credit cards\n  out once more for the right to carry on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If nothing else, you\'ll certainly be able to claim you had no queues at launch\n  and everyone was able to log straight in.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/s600/soh4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/w640-h360/soh4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was going to post something more high-minded about all this but\n  <i>Wilhelm </i>got there before me so I took the low road. For a less snarky\n  take on the situation I refer you to\n  <i><a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">TAGN</span></a></i>. I do have a few semi-serious observations of my own to make, though.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1890100/Ship_of_Heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Ship of Heroes</span></a>\n  launched yesterday to a largely disinterested gaming public, most of whom had\n  probably only heard of the game at all thanks to the recent flurry of\n  (Negative.) press interest generated by open disbelief at the price point. If\n  the plan was to raise the game\'s profile then I suppose they achieved it but I\n  suspect they may be learning there is such a thing as bad publicity after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game is available through Steam and only through Steam, so for once we\n  have an MMORPG whose exact population is relatively easy to ascertain.\n  <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1890100/charts/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The numbers are in</span></a>\n  and they are not pretty.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;The "<i>All Time</i>" (By which we mean two days.) peak stands at a tidy\n  100. As I type this, there are sixteen players online.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just for contrast,<i> Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen</i>, which entered Early\n  Access on Steam last December at a box price of $39.99, has an all-time\n  peak of just under 7,000 players with five hundred people playing right now.\n  That sounds like it might be a viable business model. This does not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Then again, who am I to say? I played both games, very briefly, in open\n  testing and decided not to pay much more attention to either of them. I might\n  have been the target market once but that seems a very long time ago now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It would also be ridiculous of me to pretend to be surprised by how the Ship\n  of Heroes launch is going. Apart from that irritating clique that seems to\n  think everything is de facto better the more pointlessly exclusive you make\n  it, there has been universal incomprehension at the business model\n  <i>Heroic Games </i>has chosen. No-one expected it to pay off and it has\n  exceeded even those expectations. Or fallen below them. However that goes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not even really surprised to hear the game is janky, buggy and crashes a\n  lot, as many reviews on Steam complain. I\n  <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2023/10/shape-up-or-ship-out.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">reviewed </span></a>one of the tests a couple of years ago and made many of the same observations\n  then. It seems little has changed.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxBJZnrl0MREgjZaF_e3nCVc3s4eAUIgYvkwtj2Cod6h3yrP8xFqBHKUnzu_hDzIQcphsK6gl0FQYX-StGdqHTRjKt3aIFzALjHcpA3MUXyVW7H1yym9WznRbrTVpFEjnfVyGhKbnXj4kddIKqekVha_Av9VaK2JIZMTgLdOIEhqO7ZoTHzCOVxVlLUXg/s600/soh5.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxBJZnrl0MREgjZaF_e3nCVc3s4eAUIgYvkwtj2Cod6h3yrP8xFqBHKUnzu_hDzIQcphsK6gl0FQYX-StGdqHTRjKt3aIFzALjHcpA3MUXyVW7H1yym9WznRbrTVpFEjnfVyGhKbnXj4kddIKqekVha_Av9VaK2JIZMTgLdOIEhqO7ZoTHzCOVxVlLUXg/w640-h360/soh5.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Perhaps surprisingly, I wasn\'t entirely negative back then. I ended my review\n  by saying "<i>For all its many flaws, I quite enjoyed it. If and when it reaches some\n    kind of always-up, no-more-wipes state - open beta or Early Access, let\'s\n    say - I might be willing to give it an extended run - if they fix the most\n    egregious of the technical issues, that is.</i>"&nbsp;I was clearly not expecting to be asked to pay sixty dollars for what\n  sounds like much the same build, let alone another fifteen a month in\n  perpetuity.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The thing is, I\'d quite like a good super-hero game. I\'ve been a fan of the\n  genre since early childhood. I read the comics. I watch the TV shows and the\n  movies. I even play one of the existing super-hero games, now and again. I\n  ought to be an easy mark for something like this.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If Ship of Heroes had launched on Steam with an Early Access model with a\n  modest buy-in I <i>might</i> have considered it. I considered Pantheon but\n  thought the box price was a little steep. At $20 I\'d have been there for\n  launch.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I still keep it in mind in case of a sale, though. It\'s on my Steam Wishlist\n  for that very reason. I\'d at least have done that much for <i>SoH</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If SoH had arrived on Steam as a F2P title, instead of this you\'d be reading\n  my First Impressions piece by now. I\'d certainly have been interested enough\n  to download it and give it a session or two.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Maybe I\'d have been disappointed. Maybe I\'d have made some negative comments.\n  Still, I bet I\'d have found a few good things to say, like I did with the\n  tests. The goodwill would have been there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  No-one who isn\'t delusional is going to give much goodwill to a game that\n  plays like a poorly-optimized, unpolished indie title but asks you to pay the\n  price you\'d expect to give for a triple-A critical darling. And then piles a\n  monthly sub on top of that. If you\'re looking to create bad word of mouth,\n  that\'s the way to go about it.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiamx0hhroFVUriNXuuSA65hf0UKVCOCgosHqdGQc5Cu5n1akAICTxQsPvc6hoYEXplHSW1RuFUvNRxEf6hwL-siV0f-QWr3gELN9ZX5W0YP6Qj5Do5JiMCDH6KvwmSOFPIkWF6PXUzsndoStwId_KqGGGJUwbyBVpXcQhvZ-Eb1PFp2hOs_8geSaV3Aco/s600/soh6.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiamx0hhroFVUriNXuuSA65hf0UKVCOCgosHqdGQc5Cu5n1akAICTxQsPvc6hoYEXplHSW1RuFUvNRxEf6hwL-siV0f-QWr3gELN9ZX5W0YP6Qj5Do5JiMCDH6KvwmSOFPIkWF6PXUzsndoStwId_KqGGGJUwbyBVpXcQhvZ-Eb1PFp2hOs_8geSaV3Aco/w640-h360/soh6.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  When you come in with a pricing structure like that, you have to expect to be\n  compared to the&nbsp; peer group that lives where you\'ve gone: household\n  names, famous I.P.s, celebrity game designers. You\'re competing with games\n  that win awards and break sales records for their innovation and execution.\n  You don\'t get your slack cut just because you\'re a plucky little indie\n  everyone\'s rooting for. Not in that company.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Where Ship of Heroes goes from here is hard to guess. You\'d think it would be\n  game over, so to speak, but I can quote you the names of half a dozen MMORPGs\n  that have been trundling along with single-figure populations for years. You\n  wouldn\'t recognize any of the names because they\'re super-obscure but they\'re\n  out there.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even some of the better-known ones have numbers similar to Ship of Heroes. Go\n  check how <i>Anarchy Online</i> is doing on Steam these days. Or\n  <i>Rose Online</i>. Although, both of those can be played outside the Steam\n  infrastructure, so it may not be a fair comparison. Also, they\'ve been around\n  for decades. They didn\'t just launch yesterday.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It is possible Ship of Heroes will drift along the bottom of the genre, played\n  by few and forgotten by all. I kind of hope so because as I said, there is\n  potential there, somewhere. It\'s hard to imagine it will ever be realized but\n  I guess it\'s possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if the bugs are squashed and the jank eliminated and the proposed DLC\n  (Free with cost of purchase for two years, if that\'s all you were waiting to\n  hear before slapping your cash on the table...) ever materialize, there\'s\n  still the uncomfortable fact that this is a game no-one was really asking\n  for.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The whole point of Ship of Heroes and the other two would-be wearers of the\n  <i>City of Heroes</i> cape was that they would be a new home for all those\n  players who couldn\'t play the game they loved any more, thanks to\n  <i>NCSoft </i>doing what NCSoft does and shutting it down.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except <i>CoH </i>resurfaced, the same as it ever was, and through some\n  hitherto unsuspected super-power, managed to convince its former corporate\n  overlords not only to let it stick around but to hand it its legal papers,\n  allowing the <i>Homecoming </i>server to provide a genuine, enduring home for\n  all those players who thought they\'d never go home again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And who needs a ship when you\'ve got a home? Especially an overpriced cruise\n  ship, sailing round in ever-decreasing circles.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n  <i><span style="font-size: x-small;">[All screenshots from the Steam Store Page and I have to say they make\n      the game look a lot better than the reviews suggest...]&nbsp;</span></i>\n</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgB56OgKW9klfMXg6Q9hK4XfhqjRPCbTMm0dHf_ZemxcymiLUVybC6_4Hft4T7yRF4yVRlwlhOBoQNKY27Jgbdts3IsGN4uQvRh5uuQ5gvFJbjdnJ60GWpweWWkZtbTg50QWFAgqkPUpdyccBU12Ri7xhEB_lNIxb-Wx8W8pWBTKMVi-pfw15HpnyZ_7Go/s600/soh3.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgB56OgKW9klfMXg6Q9hK4XfhqjRPCbTMm0dHf_ZemxcymiLUVybC6_4Hft4T7yRF4yVRlwlhOBoQNKY27Jgbdts3IsGN4uQvRh5uuQ5gvFJbjdnJ60GWpweWWkZtbTg50QWFAgqkPUpdyccBU12Ri7xhEB_lNIxb-Wx8W8pWBTKMVi-pfw15HpnyZ_7Go/w640-h360/soh3.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />It\'s always an exciting day when a new MMORPG launches, isn\'t it?

That last\n  allegation appears to have been disputed by the developers but the general\n  impression is that the voice acting is "<i>awful</i>" no matter whether humans\n  or machines are doing it, so it probably doesn\'t matter much either way.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that in place (And a lot more besides.) it\'s safe to assume your\n  players won\'t run into any of those all-too-familiar launch day issues. Your\n  servers will almost certainly be able to withstand the strain of the teens of\n  people willing to stump up the cost of<i> Baldurs Gate 3 </i>for a chance to\n  play "<i>a buggy mess</i>" for a month before having to get their credit cards\n  out once more for the right to carry on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If nothing else, you\'ll certainly be able to claim you had no queues at launch\n  and everyone was able to log straight in.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/s600/soh4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/w640-h360/soh4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was going to post something more high-minded about all this but\n  <i>Wilhelm </i>got there before me so I took the low road. For a less snarky\n  take on the situation I refer you to\n  <i><a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">TAGN</span></a></i>. I do have a few semi-serious observations of my own to make, though.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1890100/Ship_of_Heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Ship of Heroes</span></a>\n  launched yesterday to a largely disinterested gaming public, most of whom had\n  probably only heard of the game at all thanks to the recent flurry of\n  (Negative.) press interest generated by open disbelief at the price point. If\n  the plan was to raise the game\'s profile then I suppose they achieved it but I\n  suspect they may be learning there is such a thing as bad publicity after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game is available through Steam and only through Steam, so for once we\n  have an MMORPG whose exact population is relatively easy to ascertain.\n  <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1890100/charts/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The numbers are in</span></a>\n  and they are not pretty.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;The "<i>All Time</i>" (By which we mean two days.) peak stands at a tidy\n  100. As I type this, there are sixteen players online.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just for contrast,<i> Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen</i>, which entered Early\n  Access on Steam last December at a box price of $39.99, has an all-time\n  peak of just under 7,000 players with five hundred people playing right now.\n  That sounds like it might be a viable business model. This does not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Then again, who am I to say? I played both games, very briefly, in open\n  testing and decided not to pay much more attention to either of them. I might\n  have been the target market once but that seems a very long time ago now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It would also be ridiculous of me to pretend to be surprised by how the Ship\n  of Heroes launch is going. Apart from that irritating clique that seems to\n  think everything is de facto better the more pointlessly exclusive you make\n  it, there has been universal incomprehension at the business model\n  <i>Heroic Games </i>has chosen. No-one expected it to pay off and it has\n  exceeded even those expectations. Or fallen below them. However that goes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not even really surprised to hear the game is janky, buggy and crashes a\n  lot, as many reviews on Steam complain. I\n  <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2023/10/shape-up-or-ship-out.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">reviewed </span></a>one of the tests a couple of years ago and made many of the same observations\n  then. It seems little has changed.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxBJZnrl0MREgjZaF_e3nCVc3s4eAUIgYvkwtj2Cod6h3yrP8xFqBHKUnzu_hDzIQcphsK6gl0FQYX-StGdqHTRjKt3aIFzALjHcpA3MUXyVW7H1yym9WznRbrTVpFEjnfVyGhKbnXj4kddIKqekVha_Av9VaK2JIZMTgLdOIEhqO7ZoTHzCOVxVlLUXg/s600/soh5.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxBJZnrl0MREgjZaF_e3nCVc3s4eAUIgYvkwtj2Cod6h3yrP8xFqBHKUnzu_hDzIQcphsK6gl0FQYX-StGdqHTRjKt3aIFzALjHcpA3MUXyVW7H1yym9WznRbrTVpFEjnfVyGhKbnXj4kddIKqekVha_Av9VaK2JIZMTgLdOIEhqO7ZoTHzCOVxVlLUXg/w640-h360/soh5.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Perhaps surprisingly, I wasn\'t entirely negative back then. I ended my review\n  by saying "<i>For all its many flaws, I quite enjoyed it. If and when it reaches some\n    kind of always-up, no-more-wipes state - open beta or Early Access, let\'s\n    say - I might be willing to give it an extended run - if they fix the most\n    egregious of the technical issues, that is.</i>"&nbsp;I was clearly not expecting to be asked to pay sixty dollars for what\n  sounds like much the same build, let alone another fifteen a month in\n  perpetuity.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The thing is, I\'d quite like a good super-hero game. I\'ve been a fan of the\n  genre since early childhood. I read the comics. I watch the TV shows and the\n  movies. I even play one of the existing super-hero games, now and again. I\n  ought to be an easy mark for something like this.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If Ship of Heroes had launched on Steam with an Early Access model with a\n  modest buy-in I <i>might</i> have considered it. I considered Pantheon but\n  thought the box price was a little steep. At $20 I\'d have been there for\n  launch.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I still keep it in mind in case of a sale, though. It\'s on my Steam Wishlist\n  for that very reason. I\'d at least have done that much for <i>SoH</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If SoH had arrived on Steam as a F2P title, instead of this you\'d be reading\n  my First Impressions piece by now. I\'d certainly have been interested enough\n  to download it and give it a session or two.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Maybe I\'d have been disappointed. Maybe I\'d have made some negative comments.\n  Still, I bet I\'d have found a few good things to say, like I did with the\n  tests. The goodwill would have been there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  No-one who isn\'t delusional is going to give much goodwill to a game that\n  plays like a poorly-optimized, unpolished indie title but asks you to pay the\n  price you\'d expect to give for a triple-A critical darling. And then piles a\n  monthly sub on top of that. If you\'re looking to create bad word of mouth,\n  that\'s the way to go about it.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiamx0hhroFVUriNXuuSA65hf0UKVCOCgosHqdGQc5Cu5n1akAICTxQsPvc6hoYEXplHSW1RuFUvNRxEf6hwL-siV0f-QWr3gELN9ZX5W0YP6Qj5Do5JiMCDH6KvwmSOFPIkWF6PXUzsndoStwId_KqGGGJUwbyBVpXcQhvZ-Eb1PFp2hOs_8geSaV3Aco/s600/soh6.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiamx0hhroFVUriNXuuSA65hf0UKVCOCgosHqdGQc5Cu5n1akAICTxQsPvc6hoYEXplHSW1RuFUvNRxEf6hwL-siV0f-QWr3gELN9ZX5W0YP6Qj5Do5JiMCDH6KvwmSOFPIkWF6PXUzsndoStwId_KqGGGJUwbyBVpXcQhvZ-Eb1PFp2hOs_8geSaV3Aco/w640-h360/soh6.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  When you come in with a pricing structure like that, you have to expect to be\n  compared to the&nbsp; peer group that lives where you\'ve gone: household\n  names, famous I.P.s, celebrity game designers. You\'re competing with games\n  that win awards and break sales records for their innovation and execution.\n  You don\'t get your slack cut just because you\'re a plucky little indie\n  everyone\'s rooting for. Not in that company.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Where Ship of Heroes goes from here is hard to guess. You\'d think it would be\n  game over, so to speak, but I can quote you the names of half a dozen MMORPGs\n  that have been trundling along with single-figure populations for years. You\n  wouldn\'t recognize any of the names because they\'re super-obscure but they\'re\n  out there.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even some of the better-known ones have numbers similar to Ship of Heroes. Go\n  check how <i>Anarchy Online</i> is doing on Steam these days. Or\n  <i>Rose Online</i>. Although, both of those can be played outside the Steam\n  infrastructure, so it may not be a fair comparison. Also, they\'ve been around\n  for decades. They didn\'t just launch yesterday.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It is possible Ship of Heroes will drift along the bottom of the genre, played\n  by few and forgotten by all. I kind of hope so because as I said, there is\n  potential there, somewhere. It\'s hard to imagine it will ever be realized but\n  I guess it\'s possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if the bugs are squashed and the jank eliminated and the proposed DLC\n  (Free with cost of purchase for two years, if that\'s all you were waiting to\n  hear before slapping your cash on the table...) ever materialize, there\'s\n  still the uncomfortable fact that this is a game no-one was really asking\n  for.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The whole point of Ship of Heroes and the other two would-be wearers of the\n  <i>City of Heroes</i> cape was that they would be a new home for all those\n  players who couldn\'t play the game they loved any more, thanks to\n  <i>NCSoft </i>doing what NCSoft does and shutting it down.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except <i>CoH </i>resurfaced, the same as it ever was, and through some\n  hitherto unsuspected super-power, managed to convince its former corporate\n  overlords not only to let it stick around but to hand it its legal papers,\n  allowing the <i>Homecoming </i>server to provide a genuine, enduring home for\n  all those players who thought they\'d never go home again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And who needs a ship when you\'ve got a home? Especially an overpriced cruise\n  ship, sailing round in ever-decreasing circles.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n  <i><span style="font-size: x-small;">[All screenshots from the Steam Store Page and I have to say they make\n      the game look a lot better than the reviews suggest...]&nbsp;</span></i>\n</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/welcome-to-ship-of-heroes-come-aboard.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/welcome-to-ship-of-heroes-come-aboard.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgB56OgKW9klfMXg6Q9hK4XfhqjRPCbTMm0dHf_ZemxcymiLUVybC6_4Hft4T7yRF4yVRlwlhOBoQNKY27Jgbdts3IsGN4uQvRh5uuQ5gvFJbjdnJ60GWpweWWkZtbTg50QWFAgqkPUpdyccBU12Ri7xhEB_lNIxb-Wx8W8pWBTKMVi-pfw15HpnyZ_7Go/s72-w640-h360-c/soh3.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '8'}

We\'ve reached the point where I\'d pretty much stopped making new characters, or at any rate new characters I had any real intention of playing. I didn\'t stop playing <i>EQ</i>, I just mostly relied on the characters I already had and any new ones I made were mainly to try out various retro servers or to perform basic admin functions like banking.</p><p>In order of creation, the Final <strike>Five </strike>Six are:&nbsp;</p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">20 - Nikolaiovitch</span> - <span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 18)</span></b> - <b><i>Born 6 January 2006 - Played 14 hours 45 minutes</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">21 - Lyrielle </span></b>- <b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 35)</span><i>&nbsp;- Born 29 June 2006 -&nbsp;Played&nbsp;6 days 6 hours</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">22 - Woolhat </span></b>-<span style="font-size: medium;"> </span><b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 23)</span><i> - Born 20 July 2008 -&nbsp;Played 8 hours 30 minutes</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">23 - Gladwaller</span> </b>- <b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 85) </span><i>-&nbsp;Born 22 August 2008 -&nbsp;Played 1 day 17 hours</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">24 - Cofferstone </span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 2)</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></b>- <i><b>Born 7 March 2015 -&nbsp;Played 1 day 9 hours</b></i></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">25 - Telza</span> </b>-<b><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>&nbsp;</i>(Level 85)</span><i> Born 17 March 2017 -&nbsp;Played&nbsp;&nbsp;3 hours 23 minutes</i></b></p><p><i>Nikolaiovitch </i>is the Gnome Necromancer I made to replicate my original Gnome Necromancer, <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/08/7-nickolai-born-9-march-2000-29-days-1.html"><i>Nickolai</i></a></span>. I don\'t have any clear memory of exactly why I needed another Necro at the start of 2006 and with a played time of a little less than fifteen hours, I clearly never did much with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Since he\'s currently on <i>Luclin-Stromm</i>, the home of the bulk of my most regularly-played characters over the last twenty years, I\'m guessing I had some plan to level him up that never really went anywhere. I have the vaguest memory that I ended up not liking the way I\'d made his name so similar to a much more established character and that it put me off playing him but I probably didn\'t need much of an excuse to leave him where he is now, in <i>the Bazaar, </i>hanging around the bank.</p><p>If Nickolaiovitch is a bit of a mystery, <i>Lyrielle </i>is a giant enigma. I have no memory of her whatsoever and yet she\'s somehow managed to get to Level 35, with over six days played. That\'s a hundred and fifty hours of online time and looking at her skills I can see she\'s been played normally for pretty much all of that, which is at least fifty full-length sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>Her casting skills are all close to maxed for her level, she\'s worked on tailoring some, she\'s almost maxed in Forage. Her bags have stacks of fish scales, suggesting she\'s done some fishing in her time. She\'s wearing a mish-mash of exactly the kind of gear I\'d expect one of my characters to have if they\'d been played properly or at least the way I usually play.</p><p>And yet I remember nothing about her at all. She\'s another Druid, so nothing about the gameplay would have been likely to have stuck in my memory. She\'s on <i>Xegony/Druzil Ro</i>, two servers I have never knowingly played on, although Xegony is where Mrs Bhagpuss and I ended up moving our <i>Ant. Bayle</i> crew, right before we stopped playing them altogether.</p><p>The only real clue is her birth month, June 2006. Thanks to the extremely useful <a href="https://bonzz.com/eqservers.htm"><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><i>EverQuest Servers</i> list </span></a>at <i>Bonzz.com</i>. I\'m able to say that two new servers launched that month - <i>The Combine</i> and <i>The Sleeper.</i>&nbsp;As I write, a faint memory is coming back to me that I did indeed play on The Combine when it launched and Bonzz notes that The Combine was merged into Druzzil Ro three years later, which is pretty conclusive proof that Lyrielle was the character I played.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCD-_8_o8eNrgr63e_gNVNTmR09K9VxW9bAXzNK7ptntJcHuBmtzVxtGzJZOMwABeZtoAYsv9nL8zBwVdoWgbZmBB7ShcENx4i3J4avirIZMzkWc_qfi0mHSjNG0qvZPsYJ4zmgIu4H4UapNGCEKXWiPZI03YQ7Xe32SRtGmnO1_LfpvrwcTvHpN8ZEy8/s1313/eqlyrielle1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="370" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCD-_8_o8eNrgr63e_gNVNTmR09K9VxW9bAXzNK7ptntJcHuBmtzVxtGzJZOMwABeZtoAYsv9nL8zBwVdoWgbZmBB7ShcENx4i3J4avirIZMzkWc_qfi0mHSjNG0qvZPsYJ4zmgIu4H4UapNGCEKXWiPZI03YQ7Xe32SRtGmnO1_LfpvrwcTvHpN8ZEy8/w640-h370/eqlyrielle1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>So, it appears that in the summer of 2006 I made a new druid to play on a new TLP/Classic/Level Restricted server and stuck it out long enough to get her to Level 35, which would have required some fairly serious commitment. A hundred and fifty hours\' worth, in fact. That means I must have played Lyrielle for longer than nearly every game on my <i>Steam </i>account - and I still can\'t tell you a damn thing about her!</p><p>I can\'t even remember why she\'s called Lyrielle. Most of my characters are named for some other character in some book I read and this certainly sounds like one of those names but it\'s not ringing any bells at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With <i>Woolhat</i>, on the other hand, I know exactly where the name comes from. He\'s an Iksar Monk and he used to be called <i>Nesmith</i>. Then there was some server merge or other and he ended up with an X on the end of his name so I renamed him Woolhat.&nbsp;</p><p>I imagine most people reading this (People read this stuff?!) don\'t need any further explanation but for the few that may, <i>Mike Nesmith</i> was one of<i> the Monkees</i> and I thought it was clever to name a Monk after a Monkee. I bet no-one else ever thought of that! And his nickname in the TV show was Woolhat. Because he always wore a wool hat. So the renaming was even cleverer!&nbsp;</p><p>(The Monkees were a pop group. They had a TV show in the sixties. Ask your grandparents.)</p><p>Nesmith/Woolhat did get played a little but for the longest time his main function has been as one of my Bazaar traders and bankers. He holds and sells a lot of stuff for other characters. These days, hold it is all he does because I haven\'t set him to trade for years. But he\'s happy enough.</p><p><i>Gladwaller</i>, it will surprise no-one to know, has been boosted. I didn\'t level him to 85. He was played, though, for a while, before that happened. He\'s a Gnome Enchanter and I made him when I fancied playing the class and didn\'t have one to hand. I messed around with him for a bit and got him into the teens or twenties then dropped him, I think because we moved servers.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no clue why I boosted him years later. The idea of jumping in at Level 85 and trying to play an Enchanter, either solo or in a group, is just fatuous. Maybe I wanted a buff-bot. I\'m pretty sure he\'s never left <i>Plane of Knowledge </i>since he drank the potion.</p><p>His name would appear to be <a href="https://salinger.org/characters/gladwaller/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">taken </span></a>from <i>J.D. Salinger</i>, which would make him my most literary of steals. As a massive Salinger fan, I may well have chosen it deliberately because of that, although I don\'t recall doing it. More likely I just had the name in mind from reading some Salinger around the same time.</p><p><i>Cofferstone</i>\'s name probably comes from <i>Frances Hardinge</i>\'s&nbsp; <i>Fly By Night</i> or<i> Twilight Robbery</i>, two excellent novels from which I\'ve borrowed several names for characters in various games.

No, this is the final installment in my much-delayed series commemorating <i>EverQuest</i>\'s twenty-fifth anniversary. If the filings from the <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/22/daybreak-wins-a-preliminary-injunction-against-the-heroes-journey/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">ongoing lawsuit</span></a> against pirate server <i>The Heroes\' Journey</i> are any indication, we may not get to the thirtieth so I guess I ought to get on with wrapping this up before it\'s too late.<p></p><p>And as I intimated last time, I\'m going to bundle the remaining characters up into one post because I don\'t have an awful lot to say about any of them. We\'ve reached the point where I\'d pretty much stopped making new characters, or at any rate new characters I had any real intention of playing. I didn\'t stop playing <i>EQ</i>, I just mostly relied on the characters I already had and any new ones I made were mainly to try out various retro servers or to perform basic admin functions like banking.</p><p>In order of creation, the Final <strike>Five </strike>Six are:&nbsp;</p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">20 - Nikolaiovitch</span> - <span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 18)</span></b> - <b><i>Born 6 January 2006 - Played 14 hours 45 minutes</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">21 - Lyrielle </span></b>- <b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 35)</span><i>&nbsp;- Born 29 June 2006 -&nbsp;Played&nbsp;6 days 6 hours</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">22 - Woolhat </span></b>-<span style="font-size: medium;"> </span><b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 23)</span><i> - Born 20 July 2008 -&nbsp;Played 8 hours 30 minutes</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">23 - Gladwaller</span> </b>- <b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 85) </span><i>-&nbsp;Born 22 August 2008 -&nbsp;Played 1 day 17 hours</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">24 - Cofferstone </span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 2)</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></b>- <i><b>Born 7 March 2015 -&nbsp;Played 1 day 9 hours</b></i></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">25 - Telza</span> </b>-<b><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>&nbsp;</i>(Level 85)</span><i> Born 17 March 2017 -&nbsp;Played&nbsp;&nbsp;3 hours 23 minutes</i></b></p><p><i>Nikolaiovitch </i>is the Gnome Necromancer I made to replicate my original Gnome Necromancer, <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/08/7-nickolai-born-9-march-2000-29-days-1.html"><i>Nickolai</i></a></span>. I don\'t have any clear memory of exactly why I needed another Necro at the start of 2006 and with a played time of a little less than fifteen hours, I clearly never did much with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Since he\'s currently on <i>Luclin-Stromm</i>, the home of the bulk of my most regularly-played characters over the last twenty years, I\'m guessing I had some plan to level him up that never really went anywhere. I have the vaguest memory that I ended up not liking the way I\'d made his name so similar to a much more established character and that it put me off playing him but I probably didn\'t need much of an excuse to leave him where he is now, in <i>the Bazaar, </i>hanging around the bank.</p><p>If Nickolaiovitch is a bit of a mystery, <i>Lyrielle </i>is a giant enigma. I have no memory of her whatsoever and yet she\'s somehow managed to get to Level 35, with over six days played. That\'s a hundred and fifty hours of online time and looking at her skills I can see she\'s been played normally for pretty much all of that, which is at least fifty full-length sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>Her casting skills are all close to maxed for her level, she\'s worked on tailoring some, she\'s almost maxed in Forage. Her bags have stacks of fish scales, suggesting she\'s done some fishing in her time. She\'s wearing a mish-mash of exactly the kind of gear I\'d expect one of my characters to have if they\'d been played properly or at least the way I usually play.</p><p>And yet I remember nothing about her at all. She\'s another Druid, so nothing about the gameplay would have been likely to have stuck in my memory. She\'s on <i>Xegony/Druzil Ro</i>, two servers I have never knowingly played on, although Xegony is where Mrs Bhagpuss and I ended up moving our <i>Ant. Bayle</i> crew, right before we stopped playing them altogether.</p><p>The only real clue is her birth month, June 2006. Thanks to the extremely useful <a href="https://bonzz.com/eqservers.htm"><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><i>EverQuest Servers</i> list </span></a>at <i>Bonzz.com</i>. I\'m able to say that two new servers launched that month - <i>The Combine</i> and <i>The Sleeper.</i>&nbsp;As I write, a faint memory is coming back to me that I did indeed play on The Combine when it launched and Bonzz notes that The Combine was merged into Druzzil Ro three years later, which is pretty conclusive proof that Lyrielle was the character I played.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCD-_8_o8eNrgr63e_gNVNTmR09K9VxW9bAXzNK7ptntJcHuBmtzVxtGzJZOMwABeZtoAYsv9nL8zBwVdoWgbZmBB7ShcENx4i3J4avirIZMzkWc_qfi0mHSjNG0qvZPsYJ4zmgIu4H4UapNGCEKXWiPZI03YQ7Xe32SRtGmnO1_LfpvrwcTvHpN8ZEy8/s1313/eqlyrielle1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="370" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCD-_8_o8eNrgr63e_gNVNTmR09K9VxW9bAXzNK7ptntJcHuBmtzVxtGzJZOMwABeZtoAYsv9nL8zBwVdoWgbZmBB7ShcENx4i3J4avirIZMzkWc_qfi0mHSjNG0qvZPsYJ4zmgIu4H4UapNGCEKXWiPZI03YQ7Xe32SRtGmnO1_LfpvrwcTvHpN8ZEy8/w640-h370/eqlyrielle1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>So, it appears that in the summer of 2006 I made a new druid to play on a new TLP/Classic/Level Restricted server and stuck it out long enough to get her to Level 35, which would have required some fairly serious commitment. A hundred and fifty hours\' worth, in fact. That means I must have played Lyrielle for longer than nearly every game on my <i>Steam </i>account - and I still can\'t tell you a damn thing about her!</p><p>I can\'t even remember why she\'s called Lyrielle. Most of my characters are named for some other character in some book I read and this certainly sounds like one of those names but it\'s not ringing any bells at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With <i>Woolhat</i>, on the other hand, I know exactly where the name comes from. He\'s an Iksar Monk and he used to be called <i>Nesmith</i>. Then there was some server merge or other and he ended up with an X on the end of his name so I renamed him Woolhat.&nbsp;</p><p>I imagine most people reading this (People read this stuff?!) don\'t need any further explanation but for the few that may, <i>Mike Nesmith</i> was one of<i> the Monkees</i> and I thought it was clever to name a Monk after a Monkee. I bet no-one else ever thought of that! And his nickname in the TV show was Woolhat. Because he always wore a wool hat. So the renaming was even cleverer!&nbsp;</p><p>(The Monkees were a pop group. They had a TV show in the sixties. Ask your grandparents.)</p><p>Nesmith/Woolhat did get played a little but for the longest time his main function has been as one of my Bazaar traders and bankers. He holds and sells a lot of stuff for other characters. These days, hold it is all he does because I haven\'t set him to trade for years. But he\'s happy enough.</p><p><i>Gladwaller</i>, it will surprise no-one to know, has been boosted. I didn\'t level him to 85. He was played, though, for a while, before that happened. He\'s a Gnome Enchanter and I made him when I fancied playing the class and didn\'t have one to hand. I messed around with him for a bit and got him into the teens or twenties then dropped him, I think because we moved servers.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no clue why I boosted him years later. The idea of jumping in at Level 85 and trying to play an Enchanter, either solo or in a group, is just fatuous. Maybe I wanted a buff-bot. I\'m pretty sure he\'s never left <i>Plane of Knowledge </i>since he drank the potion.</p><p>His name would appear to be <a href="https://salinger.org/characters/gladwaller/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">taken </span></a>from <i>J.D. Salinger</i>, which would make him my most literary of steals. As a massive Salinger fan, I may well have chosen it deliberately because of that, although I don\'t recall doing it. More likely I just had the name in mind from reading some Salinger around the same time.</p><p><i>Cofferstone</i>\'s name probably comes from <i>Frances Hardinge</i>\'s&nbsp; <i>Fly By Night</i> or<i> Twilight Robbery</i>, two excellent novels from which I\'ve borrowed several names for characters in various games. If he seems to have a lot of played hours for a Level 2, that\'s because he\'s my other Bazaar trader. I have one on each of the two accounts I (used to) play regularly. Cofferstone got a lot of use when I was leveling <i>Magmia</i> by doing Overseer missions every day. You can make very good money like that. And I did, for a few months, until all the swapping between accounts to hand the stuff across got on my nerves.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/s1456/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="314" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/w640-h314/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" width="640" /></a></div>And finally we come to <i>Telza</i>, about whom there really is nothing to say.

The event, which used to be known as\n  <i>Days of Summer</i>, when it started a litle earlier in the year, is a\n  series of weekly quests in <i>EverQuest II</i> that, at least on the face of\n  it, offers a huge boost in power for casual players at the cost of very little\n  effort indeed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At least, that\'s how it appears until you take a closer look at the way it\n  works. I had the opportunity to do just that yesterday, when I went to pick up\n  the first of this year\'s quests and found I hadn\'t finished last year\'s yet.\n  Or started them, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Technically, I <i>had </i>started the 2024 set of nine quests, but only in\n  that I\'d visited <i>Bao Bao</i>, the current Panda-in-Residence, and taken the\n  first one. It was in my Journal but I hadn\'t actually done anything about it\n  in twelve months. Bao Bao was not interested in giving me this year\'s quests\n  until I finished the job I was already on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I had thought you could skip the ones you hadn\'t done. You\'d probably want to\n  if you were a new or returning player because the event has been running since\n  2017, meaning there are now seventy-two quests in the full sequence, not\n  counting the new ones this year. There are a lot of rewards from previous\n  years that still have some currency, not least the huge number of house items,\n  but the main thrust of the event has always been to gear up and who wants a\n  load of outdated armor with inferior stats?\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/The_%22Travels%22_of_Yun_Zi_Timeline">The wiki</a>\n  is somewhat confusing on whether you can skip the years you don\'t want to do:\n  "<i>Each of the quests must be completed in the order they were released,\n    starting with the quests from 2017. You cannot skip ahead to later points in\n    the quest series. </i><b><i>*2023 can be completed without previous progress in this questline.</i>"</b>&nbsp;(Emphasis theirs.) Why 2023 is different from the rest I couldn\'t tell\n  you but it doesn\'t seem to have been the start of a new, more relaxed ruleset\n  because this year\'s starter quest looked to be firmly gated behind completion\n  of last year\'s.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/s1916/eq2lfey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/w640-h302/eq2lfey1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I imagine the reason I thought you could skip was because in 2023 you really\n  could. Maybe I did. I haven\'t checked. I vaguely remember deciding last year\n  that, since I wasn\'t going to use any of the gear, I wouldn\'t bother doing the\n  quests. Or maybe that\'s post hoc rationalization. It\'s entirely possible I\n  just forgot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There were nine quests in the 2024 set. There are nine every year. It takes us\n  through the autumn to the arrival of the annual expansion, one quest dropping\n  every week after the regular update, usually, on a Tuesday. It\'s a pleasant\n  weekly ritual to get the new one, fly around for a few minutes ticking the\n  necessary boxes, then come back to see what new stuff you can grab off the\n  store-panda.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you let yourself fall behind, however, it all feels a bit less amusing.\n  Last night and this morning I did all nine quests. I did it the fastest way\n  possible, using my All Access Membership for instant travel to and from the\n  various zones, moving between the various locations within those zones on my\n  very fast, max-level flying mount and using the detailed walkthrough, complete\n  with copy-and-paste waypoints, from the Wiki.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since I was on my Level 130 Berserker, all mobs in every required zone were\n  grey to me and non-aggressive. All I had to do was port, fly, gather and\n  return. It still took me two hours to finish all nine quests.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The quests themselves were exactly as they always are: gather some samples\n  from various parts of <i>Norrath </i>so some lazy/greedy/cowardly panda can\n  satisfy their curiosity/stuff themselves stupid. Bao Bao is quite an endearing\n  panda as these things go and the quest dialog was amusing enough but the most\n  interesting part to me is how long the dev team can keep the whole thing\n  going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a whole gang of pandas standing around in\n  <i>Sundered Frontier </i>now. I think there are three questgivers and two\n  vendors at least. When the thing started in 2017 there was only\n  <i>Yun Zi </i>handing out the quests and he did his own storekeeping.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/s1920/eq2pandas1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/w640-h360/eq2pandas1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Thanks to the wiki, I had very little trouble finding everything. Almost all\n  of the items were there in profusion. Most of them sparkled and some were\n  oversized. A couple were none of those things but the wiki warned me about\n  that and told me where to look, with accompanying screenshots.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The only part that gave me any real trouble was the quest that asked for some\n  foliage from <i>Lesser Feydark</i>. Lesser Fey is and always has been a total\n  pain to navigate. It has no portals at all accessible via map travel. The best\n  you can do is map to either <i>Butcherblock </i>and take a griffin from the\n  cliffs above the dock or port to <i>Greater Feydark</i> or\n  <i>Steamfont </i>and fly to the zone-in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I went via Butcherblock first, only to find that the BB entrance brings you in\n  on the opposite side of the map to where you want to go. I figured it would be\n  faster to map-travel to GFey and come back in from that side than to fly\n  across the whole of LFey so I did that and it wasn\'t.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d forgotten that you land in <i>Kelethin </i>and Kelethin has its own map\n  and I got myself lost coming out of the dumb elf tree city and ended up\n  wandering about for ages before I finally worked out where I was supposed to\n  be going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once in LFey it wasn\'t much better because the whole place is constructed from\n  a bunch of separate valleys with invisible walls preventing you from flying\n  between them. You have to follow rivers and go through tunnels and you can\'t\n  fly through most of the connections so you have to go on foot. The whole place\n  is a confusing, annoying mess and flying really doesn\'t make it any easier.\n</p>\n<p>So <i>that </i>was fun. I got it done eventually, anyway.</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that out of the way, I was finally able to get the first of this\n  year\'s quests, for which we will be collecting rocks, just for a change. It\n  turns out Bao Bao, who demonstrated his lack of self-control when it comes to\n  stuffing things in his mouth all through the 2024 questline, ate his way\n  through his grandmother\'s entire vegetable garden and now he needs to give her\n  some pretty rocks for her collection to get back on her good side.\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/s911/eq2pandagran2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/w640-h328/eq2pandagran2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\n  Guess who\'ll be doing the hard work lugging those rocks about. Muggins, that\'s\n  who.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And that brings me to the question, once again, of whether it will be worth\n  it. I looked at the first set of rewards, which include a bunch of purple\n  Augments, some weapons and the inevitable bags of decorating items and...\n  that\'s it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Usually there are full sets of armor for all weights and dozens of Augments,\n  along with a few other odds and ends, utilities and so on. I\'m not sure if\n  that means none of those things are going to be on the vendor this time or\n  whether they\'ll only appear week-by-week. And if they aren\'t going to be\n  there, does that mean there\'s going to be a substantial change to the way gear\n  works in the new expansion?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or does it just mean someone has finally admitted that handing out three full\n  sets of gear in three months, each of which upgrades the one before, is taking\n  generosity beyond the bounds of reason? If so, you can bet there will be howls\n  of complaint.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not that the dagger I took <i>does </i>upgrade the best one already available\n  to me, anyway. I took it because it\'s an upgrade for the weapon I was using\n  but I wasn\'t using the best weapon I own. I haven\'t claimed the weapon from\n  the Anniversary crate yet. The panda dagger won\'t upgrade that and if there is\n  panda armor this year and it has the same Resolve as the weapons, that won\'t\n  upgrade the anniversary gear, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, it will be much worse. The Anniversary stuff is 525 Resolve. The new\n  panda weapons are 505.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/s913/eq2pandagran1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/w640-h328/eq2pandagran1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nEven if we discount the Anniversary gear, which you only get for one character\non the account, Resolve 505 isn\'t going to cut it for long. As a casual soloist\nI already have lots of 495 pieces so it\'s a minimal upgrade and it will be\ninstantly rendered redundant the day the expansion arrives. I don\'t know what\nthe <i>Tishan</i>\'s gear will come in at but you can bet it will be at minimum\n505 and come with Augments that work in the new zones, which none of the old\nones will.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Some of that is speculation. This is, or should be, a level cap increase year.\n  Those are usually when things change the most so anything could happen when\n  the expansion arrives. As must be plain from everything I ever write about\n  EQII, the game is ferociously over-complicated, especially when it comes to\n  gear and stats. The team have been trying to strip away some of the accrued\n  cruft for a while now but every time they remove anything there\'s an outcry,\n  not least from the crew that claims to play EQII specifically\n  <i>because </i>it\'s complicated and difficult to understand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ll be doing the panda quests anyway. They\'re a fun little diversion and\n  don\'t take too long (Lesser Feydark always excepted.) and they unlock the\n  vendors for the whole account so it\'s a useful option for some of my\n  sub-max-level characters. Most of all, though, I don\'t want to fall behind\n  again.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Who knows, next year the pandas might come up with something different. If\n  they do, it\'d be nice to be able to grab it right away instead of playing\n  catch-up first.\n</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6VjUXTrxwVUVem4fP0CEGklW0ZKxvm_t77N3cqKlewPWTfDONQHEqczqtUHkKf8tAMeSqhMJlyL6g8qSIcnrF95DLHvGe4opHCZFBXvkSk-YXgPzpbigLUF7XC5Q-5Ku8k_xBfwuEkRbOGuWuEhn2Aa95jhOcc_gAbAtxGQzq9nEj_lP_6nfZBx5Y7BM/s1920/eq2ppp1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6VjUXTrxwVUVem4fP0CEGklW0ZKxvm_t77N3cqKlewPWTfDONQHEqczqtUHkKf8tAMeSqhMJlyL6g8qSIcnrF95DLHvGe4opHCZFBXvkSk-YXgPzpbigLUF7XC5Q-5Ku8k_xBfwuEkRbOGuWuEhn2Aa95jhOcc_gAbAtxGQzq9nEj_lP_6nfZBx5Y7BM/w640-h360/eq2ppp1.jpg" width="640" /></a>A couple of days ago, I <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/out-of-fog-they-came.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">mentioned </span></a>in passing that\n  <i>Panda Panda Panda</i> was back. The event, which used to be known as\n  <i>Days of Summer</i>, when it started a litle earlier in the year, is a\n  series of weekly quests in <i>EverQuest II</i> that, at least on the face of\n  it, offers a huge boost in power for casual players at the cost of very little\n  effort indeed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At least, that\'s how it appears until you take a closer look at the way it\n  works. I had the opportunity to do just that yesterday, when I went to pick up\n  the first of this year\'s quests and found I hadn\'t finished last year\'s yet.\n  Or started them, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Technically, I <i>had </i>started the 2024 set of nine quests, but only in\n  that I\'d visited <i>Bao Bao</i>, the current Panda-in-Residence, and taken the\n  first one. It was in my Journal but I hadn\'t actually done anything about it\n  in twelve months. Bao Bao was not interested in giving me this year\'s quests\n  until I finished the job I was already on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I had thought you could skip the ones you hadn\'t done. You\'d probably want to\n  if you were a new or returning player because the event has been running since\n  2017, meaning there are now seventy-two quests in the full sequence, not\n  counting the new ones this year. There are a lot of rewards from previous\n  years that still have some currency, not least the huge number of house items,\n  but the main thrust of the event has always been to gear up and who wants a\n  load of outdated armor with inferior stats?\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/The_%22Travels%22_of_Yun_Zi_Timeline">The wiki</a>\n  is somewhat confusing on whether you can skip the years you don\'t want to do:\n  "<i>Each of the quests must be completed in the order they were released,\n    starting with the quests from 2017. You cannot skip ahead to later points in\n    the quest series. </i><b><i>*2023 can be completed without previous progress in this questline.</i>"</b>&nbsp;(Emphasis theirs.) Why 2023 is different from the rest I couldn\'t tell\n  you but it doesn\'t seem to have been the start of a new, more relaxed ruleset\n  because this year\'s starter quest looked to be firmly gated behind completion\n  of last year\'s.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/s1916/eq2lfey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/w640-h302/eq2lfey1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I imagine the reason I thought you could skip was because in 2023 you really\n  could.

This is, or should be, a level cap increase year.\n  Those are usually when things change the most so anything could happen when\n  the expansion arrives. As must be plain from everything I ever write about\n  EQII, the game is ferociously over-complicated, especially when it comes to\n  gear and stats. The team have been trying to strip away some of the accrued\n  cruft for a while now but every time they remove anything there\'s an outcry,\n  not least from the crew that claims to play EQII specifically\n  <i>because </i>it\'s complicated and difficult to understand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ll be doing the panda quests anyway. They\'re a fun little diversion and\n  don\'t take too long (Lesser Feydark always excepted.) and they unlock the\n  vendors for the whole account so it\'s a useful option for some of my\n  sub-max-level characters. Most of all, though, I don\'t want to fall behind\n  again.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Who knows, next year the pandas might come up with something different.

It\'s all a little sporadic and random\n  and I haven\'t been doing a lot of trawling for tunes on my own, mostly relying\n  on news feeds to pop me hints, but I have collected a few good picks for the\n  post I\'m about to write. Am writing. Have written, as I do the final edit.</p>\n<p>\n  Where to start? Something fast and loud is usually indicated to get the party started.

But then everything is, now. It\'s a\n  blessing and a curse.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s the deadpan that sells it, I think. All their songs have it and it just\n  levels the whole thing up. Apparently irony hasn\'t entirely gone out of fashion after all.&nbsp;</p><p>They remind me of a band I really hoped would go\n  somewhere but didn\'t,\n  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8shM_70XWY"><span style="color: #04ff00;">Ice Cold Slush</span></a></i>, although now I watch the Slushies again, maybe not so much.

The truly\n  excellent <i>Two Ribbons</i> came out in April 2022 and there\'s been pretty\n  much nothing since. Well, they did the soundtrack to that TV show I liked, the\n  one that changed its name half-way through,\n  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRiFYtZ6iJo"><span style="color: #04ff00;">The Bastard Sone and The Devil Himself</span></a></i>, aka <i>Half Bad</i>, which was the title of the source material, an\n  excellent YA trilogy by <i>Sally Green</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>LEG </i>(Never noticed how that acronyms until now.) have not, I\'m very\n  happy to say, broken up.

They\'re childhood best friends who became critical darlings while they\n  were still extremely young (Late teens.) and then suffered some personal\n  tragedies and had a big falling out, the reconciliation from which led to the\n  last album.

And when I say\n  "triggered" I don\'t mean, as I immediately realized would be the natural\n  interpretation, "<i>triggered to want a cigarette again</i>", something that\n  never, ever happens, but "<i>triggered</i>" as in "<i>immediately pay attention to</i>"?\n</p>\n<p>\n  I might very well have clicked through this when I happened upon it, even if it\n  had been called something else, because "<i>april june</i>", no capitalization,\n  is a an attention-getter. But it was the word "<i>cigarette</i>" that did\n  it. Also the phrase, "<i>bum a cigarette</i>", which I used to hear a lot but haven\'t\n  for a while.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ve commented on this before but given\n  <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8223508/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the precipitous drop-off in tobacco smoki</span><span style="color: #ff00fe;">ng</span></a>, (Down to an historic low of just under 12% of the adult population in the\n  UK, as of\n  <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2023">2023</a>.) it seems odd that so many songs and music videos feature people lighting\n  up, drawing in, blowing out and rolling up. It is true that the age\n  demographic with the highest incidence of smoking is the 25-34 range, which is\n  bang on for the artists making the music and acting in the videos I tend to\n  feature here, but even there it\'s not even 15% that smoke. You\'d think it\n  would be off-putting to the rest of the target audience, especially with the youngest\n  group, 18-24 year-olds, showing the fastest-falling tobacco use of all.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And it\'s almost always actual cigarettes, too. Hardly ever vaping, which has\n  an even smaller take-up, just in case you were thinking that\'s what all the kids do nowadays. I guess it\'s just that smoking <i>does</i> still make you\n  look cool, just like your parents always said it wouldn\'t. Even now\n  hardly anyone\'s really doing it. Or possibly because.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>&nbsp;<i>Temptation Inside Of Your Heart&nbsp;</i></b></span>\n</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Thurston Moore </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>(Velvet Underground cover)</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Let\'s switch tracks. I\'ve been reading a lot of interviews <i>Lou Reed </i>did\n  with various music journalists over about forty years recently and also\n  reviews of all his albums, so he\'s fresh in my mind again. First time that\'s\n  happened for a while.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lou was my first, great musical crush. I got into the\n  <i>Velvet Underground</i> at a fairly early age, just a few months before\n  Lou\'s solo career finally took off with <i>Walk on the Wild Side</i> in 1972.\n  I bought every one of his solo albums on release, from\n  <i>Transformer </i>through to <i>New Sensations,</i> twelve years later. I\n  dropped off the Lou train after that but I\'ve picked over the stuff I missed\n  and filled out some gaps since then, so I feel I\'m pretty much up to speed on\n  his long career.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This particular number never got a studio release while the\n  <i>Velvets </i>were around but it turned up on the excellent\n  <i><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VU_(album)">VU</a></span> </i>compilation, where it was one of the stand-outs. This, in my opinion, is not\n  a great cover. It starts out well but wanders off half-way through.<i>\n    Sonic Youth</i>\n  have always been one of those bands I feel I ought to like more than I\n  actually do and this kind of demonstrates why. Still, nice to be reminded of\n  the song again, although I suggest going and listening to\n  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-GCBPDBDVI"><span style="color: #04ff00;">the original</span></a>.\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b><i>Lou Reed Was My Babysitter </i>- Jeff Tweedy</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Jeff Tweedy</i> and his band <i>Wilco </i>I also&nbsp;feel I should like\n  more than I do. I didn\'t much like this, the first time I heard it, but\n  it\'s a bit of a grower. He\'s clearly doing Lou although he sounds more like\n  <i>Jonathan Richman</i> at times. But Jonathan was doing Lou, too, for a long time anyway, so it\'s much the\n  same thing.\n</p>\n<p>I strongly empathize with the sentiment behind the song, which in\n  Jeff\'s words is that "<i>I was babysat by fucking Lou Reed, literally, in my bedroom as a\n    10-year-old, 12-year-old kid. His music was a more legitimate mentor to me\n    than most of my teachers.</i>" That was me, too, although I can\'t match jeff\'s impressive 10-12 age profile. I\'d have to\n  add a couple of years on the front end of that.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<b><span style="font-size: x-large;"></span></b>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>&nbsp;Aston Martin</i> - Liv de Toma</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Enough with the rock.

This is one. It\'s\n  there in the rhythms and the phrasing and the intonation. Maybe I\'m making indie rock/shoegaze, too, although I\'m not about to appropriate the qualifying tag.\n  Then again, the characters in the songs, <i>they </i>would. Some of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  My late-blooming songwriting is very, very different from the stuff I was\n  doing back in the eighties. Better, I think, but then I would, or I wouldn\'t\n  keep doing it. What I\'m less sure about is whether that\'s a direct consequence\n  of my method, re-purposing prose, or if it\'s that I\'ve developed a different ear, listening to a lot of contemporary\n  artists. If I was one of those old guys who only ever listens to stuff they\n  liked when they were young, would everything I\'m doing now sound like it did\n  when I was doing it forty years ago?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I guess I don\'t need to care.

I guess that\'s what\n  married life does for you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When I can tear myself away from the mirror, I have at least been keeping up\n  with some new music, here and there. It\'s all a little sporadic and random\n  and I haven\'t been doing a lot of trawling for tunes on my own, mostly relying\n  on news feeds to pop me hints, but I have collected a few good picks for the\n  post I\'m about to write. Am writing. Have written, as I do the final edit.</p>\n<p>\n  Where to start? Something fast and loud is usually indicated to get the party started. Let\'s see...\n</p>\n<p>Ah, yes, this will do nicely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;<i>POSH</i> - The Pill</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  I mean, where do you begin?

But then everything is, now. It\'s a\n  blessing and a curse.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s the deadpan that sells it, I think. All their songs have it and it just\n  levels the whole thing up. Apparently irony hasn\'t entirely gone out of fashion after all.&nbsp;</p><p>They remind me of a band I really hoped would go\n  somewhere but didn\'t,\n  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8shM_70XWY"><span style="color: #04ff00;">Ice Cold Slush</span></a></i>, although now I watch the Slushies again, maybe not so much. Perhaps I\'m thinking of someone else. There are a lot\n  of female duos.

Ooh! Thematic segue! This is <i>Jenny Hollingworth</i>, one half of\n  <i>Let\'s Eat Grandma</i>, probably the best female duo of the last several\n  years (I\'m including <i>Wet Leg</i>&nbsp;in that, although really I think\n  they should be considered a full, five-piece band, even though they never are.)&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lets Eat Grandma is another favorite of mine now well overdue for a new album. The truly\n  excellent <i>Two Ribbons</i> came out in April 2022 and there\'s been pretty\n  much nothing since. Well, they did the soundtrack to that TV show I liked, the\n  one that changed its name half-way through,\n  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRiFYtZ6iJo"><span style="color: #04ff00;">The Bastard Sone and The Devil Himself</span></a></i>, aka <i>Half Bad</i>, which was the title of the source material, an\n  excellent YA trilogy by <i>Sally Green</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>LEG </i>(Never noticed how that acronyms until now.) have not, I\'m very\n  happy to say, broken up. They\'re just doing that annoying thing all groups do\n  at some point, namely putting the band on hold while they "<i>pursue solo projects</i>". They\'re childhood best friends who became critical darlings while they\n  were still extremely young (Late teens.) and then suffered some personal\n  tragedies and had a big falling out, the reconciliation from which led to the\n  last album. Hardly surprising they both want some time out from each other.\n  It\'s just good to hear from them again.

And when I say\n  "triggered" I don\'t mean, as I immediately realized would be the natural\n  interpretation, "<i>triggered to want a cigarette again</i>", something that\n  never, ever happens, but "<i>triggered</i>" as in "<i>immediately pay attention to</i>"?\n</p>\n<p>\n  I might very well have clicked through this when I happened upon it, even if it\n  had been called something else, because "<i>april june</i>", no capitalization,\n  is a an attention-getter. But it was the word "<i>cigarette</i>" that did\n  it. Also the phrase, "<i>bum a cigarette</i>", which I used to hear a lot but haven\'t\n  for a while.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ve commented on this before but given\n  <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8223508/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the precipitous drop-off in tobacco smoki</span><span style="color: #ff00fe;">ng</span></a>, (Down to an historic low of just under 12% of the adult population in the\n  UK, as of\n  <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2023">2023</a>.) it seems odd that so many songs and music videos feature people lighting\n  up, drawing in, blowing out and rolling up. It is true that the age\n  demographic with the highest incidence of smoking is the 25-34 range, which is\n  bang on for the artists making the music and acting in the videos I tend to\n  feature here, but even there it\'s not even 15% that smoke. You\'d think it\n  would be off-putting to the rest of the target audience, especially with the youngest\n  group, 18-24 year-olds, showing the fastest-falling tobacco use of all.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And it\'s almost always actual cigarettes, too. Hardly ever vaping, which has\n  an even smaller take-up, just in case you were thinking that\'s what all the kids do nowadays. I guess it\'s just that smoking <i>does</i> still make you\n  look cool, just like your parents always said it wouldn\'t. Even now\n  hardly anyone\'s really doing it. Or possibly because.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>&nbsp;<i>Temptation Inside Of Your Heart&nbsp;</i></b></span>\n</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Thurston Moore </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>(Velvet Underground cover)</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Let\'s switch tracks. I\'ve been reading a lot of interviews <i>Lou Reed </i>did\n  with various music journalists over about forty years recently and also\n  reviews of all his albums, so he\'s fresh in my mind again. First time that\'s\n  happened for a while.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lou was my first, great musical crush. I got into the\n  <i>Velvet Underground</i> at a fairly early age, just a few months before\n  Lou\'s solo career finally took off with <i>Walk on the Wild Side</i> in 1972.\n  I bought every one of his solo albums on release, from\n  <i>Transformer </i>through to <i>New Sensations,</i> twelve years later. I\n  dropped off the Lou train after that but I\'ve picked over the stuff I missed\n  and filled out some gaps since then, so I feel I\'m pretty much up to speed on\n  his long career.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This particular number never got a studio release while the\n  <i>Velvets </i>were around but it turned up on the excellent\n  <i><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VU_(album)">VU</a></span> </i>compilation, where it was one of the stand-outs. This, in my opinion, is not\n  a great cover. It starts out well but wanders off half-way through.<i>\n    Sonic Youth</i>\n  have always been one of those bands I feel I ought to like more than I\n  actually do and this kind of demonstrates why. Still, nice to be reminded of\n  the song again, although I suggest going and listening to\n  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-GCBPDBDVI"><span style="color: #04ff00;">the original</span></a>.\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b><i>Lou Reed Was My Babysitter </i>- Jeff Tweedy</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Jeff Tweedy</i> and his band <i>Wilco </i>I also&nbsp;feel I should like\n  more than I do. I didn\'t much like this, the first time I heard it, but\n  it\'s a bit of a grower. He\'s clearly doing Lou although he sounds more like\n  <i>Jonathan Richman</i> at times. But Jonathan was doing Lou, too, for a long time anyway, so it\'s much the\n  same thing.\n</p>\n<p>I strongly empathize with the sentiment behind the song, which in\n  Jeff\'s words is that "<i>I was babysat by fucking Lou Reed, literally, in my bedroom as a\n    10-year-old, 12-year-old kid. His music was a more legitimate mentor to me\n    than most of my teachers.</i>" That was me, too, although I can\'t match jeff\'s impressive 10-12 age profile. I\'d have to\n  add a couple of years on the front end of that.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<b><span style="font-size: x-large;"></span></b>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>&nbsp;Aston Martin</i> - Liv de Toma</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Enough with the rock.

This is one. It\'s\n  there in the rhythms and the phrasing and the intonation. Maybe I\'m making indie rock/shoegaze, too, although I\'m not about to appropriate the qualifying tag.\n  Then again, the characters in the songs, <i>they </i>would. Some of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  My late-blooming songwriting is very, very different from the stuff I was\n  doing back in the eighties. Better, I think, but then I would, or I wouldn\'t\n  keep doing it. What I\'m less sure about is whether that\'s a direct consequence\n  of my method, re-purposing prose, or if it\'s that I\'ve developed a different ear, listening to a lot of contemporary\n  artists. If I was one of those old guys who only ever listens to stuff they\n  liked when they were young, would everything I\'m doing now sound like it did\n  when I was doing it forty years ago?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I guess I don\'t need to care.

I\'ve mentioned the plethora of holiday events many times. Since all of them tend to get one or two additions every year, the dense crust of content surrounding each gets thicker all the time. But the holidays are just one of the numerous content streams that keep bubbling up, over and over again.</p><p><i>Panda Panda Panda</i>, for example. <a href="https://forums.everquest2.com/index.php?threads/panda-panda-panda-is-back.10134/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">That\'s back</span></a>. It\'s not exactly a holiday, in that there\'s no specific event being celebrated. It\'s just some agarophobic pandas with a warehouse of extremely powerful items they keep trying to give away for information they could very easily google. Assuming <i>Norrath </i>has the internet, of course.</p><p>I\'m not going to say any more about Panda Panda Panda today because although I read that the event had started, I haven\'t been to see what the reclusive bears want this time. I\'ll get a separate post out of that soon enough, I\'m sure.</p><p>I\'m also not going to talk about the new(ish) Fabled dungeon that only arrived in the game a short time ago, with the summer update. It does have a solo mode I could try out but until yesterday I <strike>hadn\'t bothered to find out </strike>didn\'t know where the zone-in was. I do now but it\'s going to have to wait until I\'m both in the mood and have the time for a proper session.</p><p>No, today I\'m going to reveal a very few facts about this year\'s expansion prequel event, <i>Heralds of Oblivion</i>. Every year we get one of these, whether we want it or not. Sometimes they can be really good. I can remember a couple that kept me occupied for weeks, putting several characters through them for the experience or the loot.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixOS4UO3YKFYyCxIwAfU3aO2Ynl5hZNVfpNk9-QLq5AZCgaovcDTfK_pIqTJ_3nfYHwzqRt9Uyre1zO8VGElctDEai7tt02_Eb9_79ocseW0jLKqM0DI1htSXrxpXa9YT_qrTQvj0lE9kUAVAfumheU2VZO3jzLw3iDEGN1VV9CYmVjA8Xwgpo8LS9gS0/s1920/eq2rift5.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixOS4UO3YKFYyCxIwAfU3aO2Ynl5hZNVfpNk9-QLq5AZCgaovcDTfK_pIqTJ_3nfYHwzqRt9Uyre1zO8VGElctDEai7tt02_Eb9_79ocseW0jLKqM0DI1htSXrxpXa9YT_qrTQvj0lE9kUAVAfumheU2VZO3jzLw3iDEGN1VV9CYmVjA8Xwgpo8LS9gS0/w640-h360/eq2rift5.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Mostly though, and especially recently, they\'ve been a bit thin. Usually a very quick quest to introduce us to the next, previously unheard-of, Norrathian secret society and a bunch of repeatable quests so we can ingratiate ourselves with them for no very obvious reason. There seem to be an unlimited number of these groups, most of them self-appointed guardians of something or other, roaming around the world like a bunch of Boy Scouts looking for old ladies to help across the street or planar incursions to repel.</p><p>This yeare\'s bunch are called <i>The Flamebearers</i> and they differ from the usual run of do-gooders by being associated with <i>Lady Najena</i>, who I could have sworn was a Medium-Sized Bad last time I met her. She\'s organizing this year\'s bunfight all the same so maybe it\'s one of those enemy-of-my-enemy things or perhaps she\'s had a bang on the head.

I\'ve actually managed to go off of hydrocodone. I can finally sleep on my side again. It\'s so nice. You don\'t know the value of your favorite sleeping position until you\'ve lost it. </span><br /><br /><span>When last we left me, I had rounded out four carboplatin and pemetrexed chemo infusions, and apparently . . . that\'s it for me. I asked the doctor for more chemo and he said no.  The most infusions they\'ll ever run is six, and the survival stats past four aren\'t good? It\'s confusing, but I trust the oncologist. Now I\'m simply running immunotherapy every three weeks.</span><br /><br /><span>That all said, man, it was so nice not to be poisoned this past Friday. This chemo does some really wild stuff to me mentally.  After the fourth dose, I wrote this note down when I was in the throes of it, <i>"There\'s a weird side effect to this chemo -- it\'s like having a quasi-hallucination, but more like a kind of a vivid, strange imagination. Just now I was able to clearly picture a girl with fiercely intense blue eyes that looked almost bird like. It\'s like a vividness to my dreams while I\'m awake (or half awake). There\'s a tingle to the world as you sit here slowly dying. Shutting down. Not caring. Hard to explain. Listlessness. That\'s what this chemo does to you."</i></span><br /><br /><span>Now that I\'m on immunotherapy only, it feels super easy in comparison. Sure, I was a little tired right afterwards, and my arms and scalp are dry and itchy, but that\'s nothing in comparison to how dark life got on days three-through-six after a carboplatin and pemetrexed infusion. </span><br /><br /><span>Apparently if my next CT scan shows even MORE improvement, then they might even consider moving me to a "stable disease" status, which is where they would cut down the amount of office visits and scans. I have to say that feels very weird, and I\'m not sure I like it. While the doctor would be happy with "stable," I want "cured." I guess when you have Stage 4 cancer, you get what you get and just be happy you\'re not dead, dummy. </span><br /><br /><span>I\'m hoping I\'m lucky and immunotherapy doesn\'t turn on me, and it does the trick. As ChatGPT put it to me, chemo was running a bulldozer through my body, and now immunotherapy is like putting the guard dogs out to attack cancer. </span><br /><br /><span>Everyone please keep sending those vibes my way. I don\'t care if they\'re prayers, meditations, or even spoken to the universe in your goofiest Count Chocula voice. You send it -- I\'ll take it.

It\'s a forced vacation. The biggest problem with that is that I\'m a stupid cancer patient as well. If a CT scan comes up on a random day of the week when we all go back to work, I can\'t just, uh, not go because I don\'t have the PTO hours. </span><br /><br /><span>By the end of this all, things will be tight for a bit unless I can get some more gifted PTO.

She\'s pretty cool. I like what she did with the song structure to change it from my xylophone and muted distant trumpets thing to a folksy blues song.</span><br /><br /><span>. . . also playing a lot of Dune Awakening with Dylan.  My friend Dylan is great by the way. He took me to lunch the other day, and I took him to see Tron Ares -- fun show!

The last half of DLC One has you revisiting some old stations around Hagga Basin. This is where the story really started to get good.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The main underlying premise of Dune (in a very condensed reader\'s digest type of explanation) is that spice is valuable because it increases our brain capacity to equal that of AI when piloting spaceships at warp speeds. AI is bad. AI is evil. We went to war with AI and we won. We don\'t want AI anymore, we want the spice. WE NEED THE SPICE!</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;. . . But that\'s the thing!&nbsp; The last half of this DLC has you going into secret labs and claiming old AI tech that is still out there buried in the sand and handing it over to the higher powers that be.

Keep it coming! This is a long fight. The third biopsy yielded genetic results that were, as my doctor called them, rare and interesting. He didn\'t know what to make of them since typically most lung cancers have some relatively well-known mutation like ALK. Nope, mine manifested something called FANCG (𝑐.1642𝐶&gt;𝑇, 𝑝.𝑅548*) – 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑐 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 1–2, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐) and RET (𝑐.1063+11𝑑𝑒𝑙𝐶) – 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑈𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 3, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐). While ChatGPT gave me some mixed hope with FANCG, my doc let me know that it\'s nothing that could really be actionable. RET, well, this mutation was more like . . . well . . . not much research has been done with it, so, good luck?</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: My doctor felt like I was still a good candidate for Immunotherapy and specifically a lung cancer trial turned lung cancer treatment called Checkmate 9LA (it was approved for use about 5 years ago or so). This will wrap in the immunotherapies known as ipilimumab and nivolumab alongside chemo. If it works, it has double the chance of sending my cancer into remission as my chemo did.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI=w360-h640" width="360" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>"HERE\'S TOMMY!"</i></div></i><p></p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I\'m legitimately terrified of moving on by adding immunotherapy to my chemotherapy regimen. I read too much about it online, and I don\'t like the odds for developing an auto-immune disorder from this amazing cancer killing method.

How much inconvenience it causes. The pain of it all. How it feels to be worlds apart from my fat-and-happy-Tom-days in Texas. I had it so good for so many years, how did I end up with this stupid crap in my lungs and back in Utah? I sometimes make the joke that I\'m "Stage 4 at JT4" at my job here in Utah and I used to be "Fat and Happy Tom" in Texas . . . you know, just making, promoting, and playing games. THE LIFE!

I sat down with Indigo and an intern and basically talked about my entire music history.

I truly want to write an album of music called "Cosmic Radiation and Bad Luck," named after what my doctor said was the most likely cause of my cancer. I know two tracks that I want on it for sure.

Keep it coming! This is a long fight. The third biopsy yielded genetic results that were, as my doctor called them, rare and interesting. He didn\'t know what to make of them since typically most lung cancers have some relatively well-known mutation like ALK. Nope, mine manifested something called FANCG (𝑐.1642𝐶&gt;𝑇, 𝑝.𝑅548*) – 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑐 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 1–2, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐) and RET (𝑐.1063+11𝑑𝑒𝑙𝐶) – 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑈𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 3, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐). While ChatGPT gave me some mixed hope with FANCG, my doc let me know that it\'s nothing that could really be actionable. RET, well, this mutation was more like . . . well . . . not much research has been done with it, so, good luck?</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: My doctor felt like I was still a good candidate for Immunotherapy and specifically a lung cancer trial turned lung cancer treatment called Checkmate 9LA (it was approved for use about 5 years ago or so). This will wrap in the immunotherapies known as ipilimumab and nivolumab alongside chemo. If it works, it has double the chance of sending my cancer into remission as my chemo did.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI=w360-h640" width="360" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>"HERE\'S TOMMY!"</i></div></i><p></p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I\'m legitimately terrified of moving on by adding immunotherapy to my chemotherapy regimen. I read too much about it online, and I don\'t like the odds for developing an auto-immune disorder from this amazing cancer killing method. I guess it really comes down to a "would you rather" type of question: Would you rather have a chance of living the rest of your life with an auto-immune disorder or simply dying with cancer? I\'ll take being alive, please. Most people are fine, but you are rolling the dice. (is a hard +1 Constitution Saving throw for my D&amp;D friends)</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I just got back from an amazing lunch at Santorini\'s Greek Restaurant at Farmington Station. My good friend Colleen bought me lunch, but only after she and my other hard-working buddies, Mandy and Hannah, entertained me through 3 hours of infusion at the Huntsman Center there in Farmington. My friends are calling themselves "Team Tom" and I am truly humbled by the love, kindness, and example they\'ve shown me today. I have often said how lucky I am to have strong female role models -- my wife, my relatives, and good friends like these. So many kind and loving women in my life. Seriously! I feel blessed! Truly examples of how I would like to be able to treat others.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj39-rGP347zVMAN69Fj6JQJNzFkSuJjtzP48IK27hSen9T3ZG-7a7xDsYiNV8Q6Cz1hfZlMZdVvmdIncrzPEx9i2m9YUpdA_qoEItimVY1btkbLbvsvG2xdpVbTYL7Y9dUAzr6FmNlLL8toRToyHKwx063dPP80rnEh8TwXGdCwm9fNqCP7iwRyXJiobA" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="296" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj39-rGP347zVMAN69Fj6JQJNzFkSuJjtzP48IK27hSen9T3ZG-7a7xDsYiNV8Q6Cz1hfZlMZdVvmdIncrzPEx9i2m9YUpdA_qoEItimVY1btkbLbvsvG2xdpVbTYL7Y9dUAzr6FmNlLL8toRToyHKwx063dPP80rnEh8TwXGdCwm9fNqCP7iwRyXJiobA" width="640" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Team Tom in Tie Dye!</i></div></i><p></p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I forget this a lot. I forget how blessed I am, and I end up sighing to the rafters in my bedroom, cursing the cancer inside of me and how stupid it all feels. How dumb I feel for having cancer. How much inconvenience it causes. The pain of it all. How it feels to be worlds apart from my fat-and-happy-Tom-days in Texas. I had it so good for so many years, how did I end up with this stupid crap in my lungs and back in Utah? I sometimes make the joke that I\'m "Stage 4 at JT4" at my job here in Utah and I used to be "Fat and Happy Tom" in Texas . . . you know, just making, promoting, and playing games. THE LIFE! No, no . . . I am blessed. It\'s just hard to see it sometimes, and that\'s just one of my many failings. Thank you, role models!</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I was able to have some complimentary music therapy from the Huntsman Institute!&nbsp; My social worker turned me on to a really cool benefit (if you can say there\'s a silver lining to having lung cancer) where I can get 6 sessions of music therapy. I sat down with Indigo and an intern and basically talked about my entire music history. (by the way, if you\'re interested and have a half hour of time to read it, you\'re welcome to read more here: <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/08/music-history.html">https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/08/music-history.html</a>). I truly want to write an album of music called "Cosmic Radiation and Bad Luck," named after what my doctor said was the most likely cause of my cancer. I know two tracks that I want on it for sure. (I\'m in the process of adding to a Spotify inspiration song list for the general vibe I want to go for: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1JGD472Z10LK5Zi77A59IL">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1JGD472Z10LK5Zi77A59IL</a>)</p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I waste too much time playing video games to write music -- I should probably stop doing that, but man is <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening">Dune Awakening</a> fun to play lately! I also dropped $12 bucks on a humble bundle deal that supplied me with 16 games that I\'ve never played before. I\'m doomed. (Not to mention all the great shows I still need to watch on Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Apple+, Prime, and on and on) It\'s nice to have so many distractions. First world problems at its best.</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: Speaking of video game distractions, I\'ve started reskinning my 1up machine to look like an honest to goodness Ghosts n\' Goblins machine! Looking pretty great! So fun to play the classic Ghosts n\' Goblins whenever I want. I\'ve almost bumped the previous owner\'s high score off of the Top Ten (yes, I know I could just reset the machine, but where\'s the fun in that?

COVID and a quarantined reality solidly hit everyone in 2020. I was staying home and with extra time on my hands. My buddy at work had a group named Bueno Sueno and they had just released a song called Lost in the Shine. I convinced him to send me the stems and flexed my remixing muscles with a mix I called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgtQu2zECs">Tom Purdue Shimmer Mix</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That remix set off a bug in me, and I started remixing or remaking some deep cut songs that were meaningful to me in one way or another. Before I knew it, I had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vWqp7YBZE&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHpgc58cpOgeOQY7F_nR3h9S">whole playlist of remixes and remakes on YouTube</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Cetu Javu\'s Fight Without a Reason (Lifestyle Remix)</li><li>Morrissey\'s Now My Heart is Full (Bunny Love Remix)</li><li>Cabaret Voltaire\'s Code (Wah Guitar Mix)</li><li>The Cure\'s Night Like This (Deeper Still Mix)</li><li>Decussion Council\'s (yes, my old high school band) Don\'t Stop (Everyone Hang On Mix)</li><li>Tom Purdue\'s Bit by Bit (2020 Mix)</li></ul><p></p><p>I wrote about all of them in&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2020/06/mixtape-fire-my-past-month-in-flames.html">this blog post from June 2020</a>. As mentioned in that blog post, I formulated a plan to release a lathe print vinyl record with a very small print run . . . 4-5 copies through a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://americanvinylco.com/product-category/one-off-and-short-run-vinyl-records/">American Vinyl</a>. When I got the records back, I thought they sounded horrible. I hadn\'t mixed the songs considering volume levels and how they would actually play on a record player. I threw them in the garbage can in disgust.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, who is much smarter than me, saved them out of the garbage can and instead stashed them in a secret spot that I would only find later when we were moving from Texas back to Utah. (which . . . is a story all unto itself.) Turns out it was mostly the fault of our bad record player at the time. There were a few sub-bass hits on the Don\'t Stop mix that were just too low and distorted a bit, but that\'s it. The record sounds great.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/s4000/20240406_195749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/w185-h400/20240406_195749.jpg" width="185" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Not the white album, it\'s a Quarantined Mix Record from Tom Purdue!</i></p><p>For real though, the life as a rock star wannabe had become nothing more than a dusty, distant 30-year-old memory up until 2021 when a great guy named Adam Terry contacted me over Instagram holding both my Darkest America and Freeze tapes from back in 1990.

With Adam\'s help, the hope of actually releasing some old music of mine on his label,&nbsp;<a href="https://fountainavm.com/">FountainAVM</a>, was now a possibility! He asked to hear more of my stuff and I flooded his Dropbox with hours upon hours of old music I had recorded on tape.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s1910/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s320/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" width="251" /></a></div><br /><p>Adam was fantastic! I\'ve never had anyone dump so many hours of their life just dedicated to listening to my music. Honestly, the real help from Adam has been feeling like someone actually cared about me as an artist enough to reach out and help me dust off the old tapes. While there may be a lot of sadness and regret from the past, his simple act of reaching out kind of unplugged so many things that I had bottled up over the years. That alone was appreciated.</p><p>From all that, Adam curated two albums of music.&nbsp; The first was just released last year. <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2024/03/an-ant-survives-rainstorm.html">As discussed in this post</a>:</p><p><i>"My new "old" album was released today by FOUNTAINavm.

MOST of them. A couple songs had been lost to time, and we just made do with the old recordings we had.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Adam curated an interesting selection that\'s different from my usual sound. I\'m happy with the result. I\'ve enjoyed riding around in my car late at night listening to An Ant Survives A Rainstorm and hope you would too.</i></p><p><i>Thanks to FOUNTAINavm for releasing this music and thanks for listening!"</i></p><p>While discussing old music with Adam, we also started discussing new music (well new music to me), and he turned me on to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6R1cNisR3xvk0ivHz13P6E">Minimalist Wave Tapes</a> project, so I started listening to it plus some old formative, meaningful music to me from the 70\'s - 90\'s like Kraftwerk, Boards of Canada, Yaz, Thompson Twins, and the Psychedelic Furs. After baptizing myself in all this music and having recently remade Bit by Bit for my Quarantined Mixes, I realized I could make a synthwave album of my own.</p><p>The end result was Red Pinto Hatchback, released in 2021. I actually made two posts about this one. One about the making of <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/09/red-pinto-hatchback-cover-art.html">the cover art</a>, and one <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/10/red-pinto-hatchback-launched.html">about the album release itself</a>. As I stated in that post:</p><p><i>". . . So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette. Truly, if you have a Walkman, I\'d love to get my music in there for you to enjoy on your new walk down old memory lane.</i></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/s3043/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/w640-h388/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" width="640" /></i></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>No school like the old school</i></p><p><i>I have to talk a bit about the title track to Rotted Leisure Rooms. It\'s a gritty industrial piece that features the synth work of David Kane. Back in 1988 I was watching 120 minutes on MTV when a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DiNYb20WY">Baby Doe Rules</a> by David Kane\'s Decay of the Western Civilization came on, and I recorded it on VHS tape. I asked every record shop I could find in Utah if they had it so I could listen to more, and no one knew what I was talking about.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Eventually I transferred the song off of VHS tape to audio tape so I could listen to it in my car. It was a rare track that no one knew. I think they played Baby Doe Rules only a handful of times late at night on MTV, but there was something about the raw sampled, industrial goodness of this track that in a way gave me permission to do the same. It was truly an inspirational track for me.</i></p><p><i>Just a year and a half ago, I found <a href="http://www.davidkanek-9.com/">David Kane\'s website</a> while remembering how influential this song was to me, and I reached out to tell him how much I enjoyed it. We traded several e-mails back and forth and somehow I convinced him to collaborate with me on this track. I\'ve enjoyed our chats and getting to know him better. Truly the best thing to come out of me making this music has already happened, and that was getting to collab with David."</i></p><p>So . . . that catches us up to August 2025 and there\'s been a lot holding me back once again:&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2024/04/whats-happened-where-have-i-been-and.html">Losing my job</a>, moving back to Utah, learning a new career, and <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/07/time-for-real-boss-fight-lung-cancer.html">being diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer</a>. I have lots of ideas for music, but haven\'t pursued them. I\'m stuck once again.</p><p>I\'ll snap out of it soon though. Adam Terry has been chatting me up again about releasing another collection of music -- he\'s just been busy running a local record shop in Salt Lake and pouring his whole life into it.&nbsp; If you\'re in Salt Lake, go checkout <a href="https://fountainrecordsslc.com/">Fountain Records</a>.

COVID and a quarantined reality solidly hit everyone in 2020. I was staying home and with extra time on my hands. My buddy at work had a group named Bueno Sueno and they had just released a song called Lost in the Shine. I convinced him to send me the stems and flexed my remixing muscles with a mix I called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgtQu2zECs">Tom Purdue Shimmer Mix</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That remix set off a bug in me, and I started remixing or remaking some deep cut songs that were meaningful to me in one way or another. Before I knew it, I had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vWqp7YBZE&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHpgc58cpOgeOQY7F_nR3h9S">whole playlist of remixes and remakes on YouTube</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Cetu Javu\'s Fight Without a Reason (Lifestyle Remix)</li><li>Morrissey\'s Now My Heart is Full (Bunny Love Remix)</li><li>Cabaret Voltaire\'s Code (Wah Guitar Mix)</li><li>The Cure\'s Night Like This (Deeper Still Mix)</li><li>Decussion Council\'s (yes, my old high school band) Don\'t Stop (Everyone Hang On Mix)</li><li>Tom Purdue\'s Bit by Bit (2020 Mix)</li></ul><p></p><p>I wrote about all of them in&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2020/06/mixtape-fire-my-past-month-in-flames.html">this blog post from June 2020</a>. As mentioned in that blog post, I formulated a plan to release a lathe print vinyl record with a very small print run . . . 4-5 copies through a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://americanvinylco.com/product-category/one-off-and-short-run-vinyl-records/">American Vinyl</a>. When I got the records back, I thought they sounded horrible. I hadn\'t mixed the songs considering volume levels and how they would actually play on a record player. I threw them in the garbage can in disgust.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, who is much smarter than me, saved them out of the garbage can and instead stashed them in a secret spot that I would only find later when we were moving from Texas back to Utah. (which . . . is a story all unto itself.) Turns out it was mostly the fault of our bad record player at the time. There were a few sub-bass hits on the Don\'t Stop mix that were just too low and distorted a bit, but that\'s it. The record sounds great.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/s4000/20240406_195749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/w185-h400/20240406_195749.jpg" width="185" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Not the white album, it\'s a Quarantined Mix Record from Tom Purdue!</i></p><p>For real though, the life as a rock star wannabe had become nothing more than a dusty, distant 30-year-old memory up until 2021 when a great guy named Adam Terry contacted me over Instagram holding both my Darkest America and Freeze tapes from back in 1990.

With Adam\'s help, the hope of actually releasing some old music of mine on his label,&nbsp;<a href="https://fountainavm.com/">FountainAVM</a>, was now a possibility! He asked to hear more of my stuff and I flooded his Dropbox with hours upon hours of old music I had recorded on tape.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s1910/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s320/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" width="251" /></a></div><br /><p>Adam was fantastic! I\'ve never had anyone dump so many hours of their life just dedicated to listening to my music. Honestly, the real help from Adam has been feeling like someone actually cared about me as an artist enough to reach out and help me dust off the old tapes. While there may be a lot of sadness and regret from the past, his simple act of reaching out kind of unplugged so many things that I had bottled up over the years. That alone was appreciated.</p><p>From all that, Adam curated two albums of music.&nbsp; The first was just released last year. <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2024/03/an-ant-survives-rainstorm.html">As discussed in this post</a>:</p><p><i>"My new "old" album was released today by FOUNTAINavm.

MOST of them. A couple songs had been lost to time, and we just made do with the old recordings we had.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Adam curated an interesting selection that\'s different from my usual sound. I\'m happy with the result. I\'ve enjoyed riding around in my car late at night listening to An Ant Survives A Rainstorm and hope you would too.</i></p><p><i>Thanks to FOUNTAINavm for releasing this music and thanks for listening!"</i></p><p>While discussing old music with Adam, we also started discussing new music (well new music to me), and he turned me on to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6R1cNisR3xvk0ivHz13P6E">Minimalist Wave Tapes</a> project, so I started listening to it plus some old formative, meaningful music to me from the 70\'s - 90\'s like Kraftwerk, Boards of Canada, Yaz, Thompson Twins, and the Psychedelic Furs. After baptizing myself in all this music and having recently remade Bit by Bit for my Quarantined Mixes, I realized I could make a synthwave album of my own.</p><p>The end result was Red Pinto Hatchback, released in 2021. I actually made two posts about this one. One about the making of <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/09/red-pinto-hatchback-cover-art.html">the cover art</a>, and one <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/10/red-pinto-hatchback-launched.html">about the album release itself</a>. As I stated in that post:</p><p><i>". . . So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette. Truly, if you have a Walkman, I\'d love to get my music in there for you to enjoy on your new walk down old memory lane.</i></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/s3043/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/w640-h388/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" width="640" /></i></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>No school like the old school</i></p><p><i>I have to talk a bit about the title track to Rotted Leisure Rooms. It\'s a gritty industrial piece that features the synth work of David Kane. Back in 1988 I was watching 120 minutes on MTV when a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DiNYb20WY">Baby Doe Rules</a> by David Kane\'s Decay of the Western Civilization came on, and I recorded it on VHS tape. I asked every record shop I could find in Utah if they had it so I could listen to more, and no one knew what I was talking about.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Eventually I transferred the song off of VHS tape to audio tape so I could listen to it in my car. It was a rare track that no one knew. I think they played Baby Doe Rules only a handful of times late at night on MTV, but there was something about the raw sampled, industrial goodness of this track that in a way gave me permission to do the same. It was truly an inspirational track for me.</i></p><p><i>Just a year and a half ago, I found <a href="http://www.davidkanek-9.com/">David Kane\'s website</a> while remembering how influential this song was to me, and I reached out to tell him how much I enjoyed it. We traded several e-mails back and forth and somehow I convinced him to collaborate with me on this track. I\'ve enjoyed our chats and getting to know him better. Truly the best thing to come out of me making this music has already happened, and that was getting to collab with David."</i></p><p>So . . . that catches us up to August 2025 and there\'s been a lot holding me back once again:&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2024/04/whats-happened-where-have-i-been-and.html">Losing my job</a>, moving back to Utah, learning a new career, and <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/07/time-for-real-boss-fight-lung-cancer.html">being diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer</a>. I have lots of ideas for music, but haven\'t pursued them. I\'m stuck once again.</p><p>I\'ll snap out of it soon though. Adam Terry has been chatting me up again about releasing another collection of music -- he\'s just been busy running a local record shop in Salt Lake and pouring his whole life into it.&nbsp; If you\'re in Salt Lake, go checkout <a href="https://fountainrecordsslc.com/">Fountain Records</a>.

I\'ve talked a bit about my wonderful distractions like Hogwarts Legacy and Dune, but really, they are just distractions from what\'s really going on with me. Unfortunately, it\'s because I have an actual health issue that\'s hard for me to talk about. I\'ve been putting it off because who wants to talk about cancer?! Ugh. Is there any good time to talk about cancer? probably not. Here we go.</p><p>About 4-5 months ago, I started having some pretty strong shoulder and back pain. At the time I thought I had done something to my shoulder while going <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/03/catching-up-with-friendly-march-2025.html">axe throwing with my church group</a>. What followed was a month of going to the chiropractor to no avail. After a couple trips to the regular doctor and two x-rays later, my doctor recommended I get a CT scan since I had some fluid on my lungs and things looked "worse."</p><p>After the CT scan review, the doctor let me know I had about five masses in my left lung, and one of them looked cancerous. We scheduled a PET scan and sure enough, my left lung lit up like a Christmas tree.</p><p>Next up typically would be a biopsy, but I managed to fast track a fluid drain from my lungs at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake, which verified, yes, this is non-small cell Adenocarcinoma in my lungs. Between that fluid analysis and my PET Scan, my oncology team let me know I\'ve been classified with Stage 4 Lung Cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>No one knows how I got it.

I\'m not sure what my decision did or did not do for me since surely I\'ll be playing Risi\'s journey as well, but they gave me an interesting choice.</span><br /><br /><span face="&quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web (West European)&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #242424; font-size: 14.6667px;">The "safe" designer in me wonders why you would ever detach someone from the main quest line, even for a moment.&nbsp; The "creative" designer in me loves the "surprise and delight" moment of even being offered a choice.&nbsp; You definitely don\'t see this same type of choice being offered in AW2 (as far as I remember correctly).&nbsp; Part of me wonders if the metrics showed them that people stopped playing at this area when they did that?&nbsp; It\'s something I\'d love to know just to answer my own curiosity.</span><br /><br /><span face="&quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web (West European)&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #242424; font-size: 14.6667px;">So far in Stikkan\'s follow-on quest, I\'ve unlocked a new wolf companion.&nbsp; He\'s a brutal dual wielder that can howl at magical ice crystals and break them so you can proceed. In this quest, I\'m finding myself swapping back and forth between companions a lot to solve puzzles and break through blocking mechanics. This feels really good in late game.

At the time, my job was to work closely with an outsourcing team in Spain to build a vertical slice of a mobile game called Unnatural Selection (UNS). The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk. When you do find something that works, you can go all in (as they did with our game <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2022/08/game-portfolio-rpg-dice-heroes-of.html">Dice RPG</a>).</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">When I got wind that we were transitioning to VR, I instantly wanted to try making our UNS mobile game as a VR game (UNSVR!). To that end, I drew up a PowerPoint pitch deck and presented it to our executives. They were interested and happy I had taken that initiative, but they wanted something a bit less risky and strange for our first VR project.&nbsp; I can\'t say I blame them!</span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">Below are a few of the slides from that PowerPoint deck:</span></p><p style="color: #222222; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/s1265/deck1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/w640-h356/deck1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/s1280/deck2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/w640-h358/deck2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/s1291/deck3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/w640-h360/deck3.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/s1920/deck5.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/w640-h360/deck5.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/s1296/deck4.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/w640-h360/deck4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Later, in 2023, WIMO hosted a game jam internally and encouraged all teams to make VR games. Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build. Below are a few slides from that Powerpoint.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXhGQaNHO29lWdW1yEdA2ppUMD5o13H1Llhw-2c67OzFsRenXcpI-oawqy_XROPxPky45IREz3Hlh_-M4Jwy4ArCSURfprZnUaYpmOFrNj2HDCG1Vq6cGRiQ6OX8vPCUN7L-J06d8DA0yZLY9WdRaYQ34hvj3bWKO1x63pUwlqwITjF4iw9oKbqiYl0tU/s1375/Screenshot%202025-04-09%20175546.png" style="margin-left: 1em;

At the time, my job was to work closely with an outsourcing team in Spain to build a vertical slice of a mobile game called Unnatural Selection (UNS). The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk. When you do find something that works, you can go all in (as they did with our game <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2022/08/game-portfolio-rpg-dice-heroes-of.html">Dice RPG</a>).</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">When I got wind that we were transitioning to VR, I instantly wanted to try making our UNS mobile game as a VR game (UNSVR!). To that end, I drew up a PowerPoint pitch deck and presented it to our executives. They were interested and happy I had taken that initiative, but they wanted something a bit less risky and strange for our first VR project.&nbsp; I can\'t say I blame them!</span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">Below are a few of the slides from that PowerPoint deck:</span></p><p style="color: #222222; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/s1265/deck1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/w640-h356/deck1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/s1280/deck2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/w640-h358/deck2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/s1291/deck3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/w640-h360/deck3.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/s1920/deck5.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/w640-h360/deck5.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/s1296/deck4.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/w640-h360/deck4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Later, in 2023, WIMO hosted a game jam internally and encouraged all teams to make VR games. Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build.

Most of your playtime will be spent looking for clues, or interviewing the various guests of the titular manor. Once enough information is uncovered, the game will prompt the player to make a deduction, which involves filling in the blanks of a sentence with colour-coded words, and phrases. It should all look very familiar to anyone who has played either of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2024/11/30/devilish-deduction-the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review/">The Golden Idol</a></em> games, and is just as satisfying here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, for my money, the reason to put <em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em> on your radar is the spooky flourishes. There’s some grade A sound design on display in the demo, and there were a couple of moments where the occasional flash of an otherworldly creature caused me to lurch in my chair. I don’t know that any of these were jump scares per se, and they tied in nicely with the supernatural themes and spooky atmosphere of the game, so I’d call it all fairplay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other notable difference for <em>Blake Manor</em> from its contemporaries is the inclusion of a timer. Every interaction costs 1 minute, which limits the number of items that a player can reasonably interact with while solving particular quandaries throughout their journey. As such, players need to think carefully about what they do, and don’t interact with, which I thought was a refreshing twist over indiscriminately interacting with everything. Though, I actually enjoy the added tension of a good timer, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, <em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em> is definitely 1 to keep your eyes on if you’re into Detective games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="moonsigil-atlas">Moonsigil Atlas</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A Deckbuilder where your cards cost physical space on the game board to play instead of energy/mana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong><em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> was 1 of 3 different demos that I had to pull myself away from early, so that I could continue playing the other demos that I had downloaded. If that doesn’t speak volumes about how fun it is, then I don’t know what does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the basic idea here is that every card has a sigil inscribed onto it. You’re then able to play said card as long as you can find room for it on your game board. At the end of each turn, your board is cleared, and you draw a new hand. In this way, <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> replaces a typical energy system with the ability for players to continue playing cards as long as they can find, or make space for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s really neat about this system is how it influences the rest of the game’s design, which is why <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> felt so fresh to play. For example, effects that create new cards require players to plan ahead so that they actually have the available space to play said cards. Likewise, any card with the Persist keyword will remain on the board, which also requires a bit of foresight so that you don’t end up inadvertently screwing yourself on a future turn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upgrade system is also affected by this design, and allows players to alter the shape of a card’s sigil in addition to augmenting its effects when played. Heck, there’s even an upgrade that allows you to swap the sigils of 2 cards, which can be useful for giving a powerful card a much smaller shape that’s easier to play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, you’ll also have to consider a card’s shape in addition to its effect before drafting it. Consideration for a card’s energy cost is also present in traditional Deckbuilders, but the higher degree of shape customization means that <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> has more granularity for what will, and won’t work well within a given deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s just so many interesting things that cascade throughout <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> because of this single foundation change. It feels like something I haven’t played before, and that’s always a welcome sight with Deckbuilders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-heavy-morning">A Heavy Morning</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>An interactive story about coping with depression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>I think it’s a really powerful feeling when you see yourself represented in a piece of media. It’s almost like you’re being acknowledged &#8211; like someone out there has seen you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, it can be a reminder that others have gone through similar experiences as you. That can be a really comforting sensation, especially while you’re actively working through those same experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say all of this as someone who has been attending therapy for depressive symptoms for over a year now. And it was really comforting to see some of my experiences represented so earnestly within <em>A Heavy Morning’s</em> demo. It was a reminder that I’m not alone because of the authenticity, and sincerity with which the subject matter was presented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also liked how cognitive reframing, and box breathing were represented. Obviously, a video game isn’t going to fully capture the experience of using different cognitive behavioural therapy techniques to deal with depression, but I thought that <em>A Heavy Morning</em> did a faithful job of recreating both as interactive mini-games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably won’t be for everyone, but I’m glad that <em>A Heavy Morning</em> exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="monsters-are-coming">Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A genre mash-up of Bullet Heaven, and Tower Defence gameplay where you build and arm a moving city, while defending it on foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Well, this was an unexpected surprise, but a welcome one to be sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I originally picked up <em>Monsters are Coming</em> because it looked like a fun twist on typical Tower Defence gameplay. Instead of plopping your towers down from on high, you’d be right in the thick of it collecting resources, and defending your mobile fortress-city while fortifying its defences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I didn’t expect was that all of the actions performed by the player character would happen automatically. This puts Monsters are Coming inline with the deluge of other would-be successors to <em>Vampire Survivor’s</em> crown over the Bullet Heaven subgenre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, I thought <em>Monsters are Coming</em> was really damn compelling, and I had to tear myself away from it. There’s so much going on between collecting resources for your town, to actually building up your fortress’ economy, and defences. This meant that I was constantly bouncing around the screen trying to do something in service of the overarching goal of surviving the oncoming hordes. The result was a game that I found really compelling to play on a moment-to-moment basis, and the screen wasn’t a complete stimulus overload either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you, like myself, have found that Bullet Heaven games aren’t quite your cup of tea, then give <em>Monsters are Coming</em> a looksie. You might be pleasantly surprised like I was after finishing a few runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tearscape">Tearscape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>What if <em>Bloodborne </em>was 2D, and available on the <em>Gameboy Color</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>I’m not sure what <em>Bloodborne </em>did to everyone who played it, but I’m more than happy to keep trying games that are inspired by it. Doubly so if those games abandon the third dimension, and slap on a pleasantly nostalgic <em>Gameboy Color</em> aesthetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite that earlier comparison, the focus in <em>Tearscape </em>isn’t exclusively on combat: it’s also a little puzzley. Though I wouldn’t say it’s puzzley in a traditional sense. Rather, <em>Tearscape </em>is puzzley in the same way that older games tended to be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a quick example of what I mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While roaming around the graveyard at the start of the demo, I saw a locked chest off in the distance. I couldn’t get to said chest because it was behind a locked gate. I did however notice that there were some stairs next to the chest, so my assumption was that there must be an underground path that I’d missed. This was proven true a few screens over when I discovered the entrance to said tunnel hidden among a couple tombstones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that this sort of thing won’t be to everyone’s taste, but I felt really smart for identifying, and actually finding my way over to that chest. The contents of the chest weren’t even that substantive &#8211; the real reward was the dopamine hit from solving the puzzle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That aside, <em>Tearscape’s </em>combat was simple, but satisfying. It almost felt like 2D <em>Zelda </em>(which I believe is intentional), though the addition of a dodge roll, and parry do add a bit of necessary spice to the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re at all like me &#8211; easily won over by a game with a nostalgic artstyle, and some modern QoL tweaks &#8211; then <em>Tearscape </em>is something you should put on your radar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dead-weight">Dead Weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>Grid-based Tactics with sky pirates, defenestration, and a Roguelike twist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>You know what’s great? Defenestration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeatedly knocking people out of windows was part of what made last year’s <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2024/11/26/lets-get-tactical-tactical-breach-wizards-review/">Tactical Breach Wizards</a></em> such a joy to play. It almost feels like you’re cheating because you’ve effectively 1-shot an enemy, but done it in a way that doesn’t seem like it should be allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mention all of this because that same principle was adopted by <em>Dead Weight</em>. It’s a grid-based Tactics game where every character has a push action, and you can leverage that to send enemies to their untimely demise instead of doing things the old fashioned way. And I’m very much in the market for another game all about shoving people to death given that <em>TBW </em>was my favourite game from last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, it should be said that you can still do things the old fashioned way. In fact, leveraging a mix of both standard combat abilities, and defenestration proved vital in completing the tutorial run that was showcased by <em>Dead Weight’s</em> demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I still have some questions about how much run-to-run variance there will actually be in <em>Dead Weight</em>, I enjoyed what I played enough to throw it on my wishlist. The cadence of combat, and focus on positioning (for both offence, and defence) made for a strong impression, as did the excellent pixel art.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="whiskerwood">Whiskerwood</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A City Builder with <em>Redwall </em>vibes where you manage a village of anthropomorphic mice, and pay taxes to your cat overlords.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Gosh. Where do I even start with <em>Whiskerwood</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose I can start with the game’s visual appeal. I feel like I don’t need to explain that one too much. The folks at <em>Minakata Dynamics</em> could have used any muridae, but Mice do make for a particularly cute group of settlers. Plus, the different building designs are chock full of rustic appeal. I see enough glass, steel, and concrete in my day-to-day to where that’s a huge plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not all aesthetics that <em>Whiskerwood </em>has going for it though &#8211; the management side of things isn’t too shabby either. Right from the get go, you’re given taxes from the royal kingdom of cats that you’ll need to figure out how to pay. They send someone around to collect payments once every 3 days, so keeping on top of your economic exports is imperative to success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this isn’t too different from the kinds of drains that you’d find in other City Builders, I appreciate how it can be filled by whatever resources a player has on hand. Ore like copper, and gold go for the highest price, but if you’d like to save some of your reserves for later payments then you can opt to fill the remainder of your tax quota with excess lumber, fish, or thatch. It’s a nice addition that makes managing your economy in <em>Whiskerwood </em>feel a little less singularly focused on prospecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that I really liked about the <em>Whiskerwood </em>demo was how your mining activities terraform the playspace. I don’t know exactly how to articulate it, but it gives the world a sense of physicality, and place that other City Builders lack. I’d also hazard a guess that in longer playthroughs than my (limited) time with the demo, the constant erasure of space (thanks to continued mining) will lead to some interesting logistical problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="barrel-roll">Barrel Roll</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A Western themed Deckbuilder where your deck consists of the bullets in your revolver. Also, there are robots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp; </strong>I don’t think it’s a secret that I enjoy Roguelike Deckbuilders. I’ve been writing this blog for almost a decade now, and a new card game has made it onto my “best of” year-end list just about every single year. Heck, last year there were 2, and I have it on good authority that there’ll be another 2 Deckbuilders claiming top 10 spots for 2025 as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s all a really long way of saying that I’m keen to find, and play new takes on the genre. So you can imagine my excitement when I watched the Steam trailer for <em>Barrel Roll</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it might not be a Deckbuilder in a wholly traditional sense, <em>Barrel Roll</em> has all the typical trappings that I look for from the genre. You’re drafting abilities, you have limited access to said abilities, and it takes careful planning and forethought to properly execute your strategy. It just so happens that you’re shooting your cards out of a revolver because they’re bullet-shaped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing that really set <em>Barrel Roll</em> apart for me though was how players are expected to manage their resources. You can only shoot each of your bullets once before you need to reload, and you’re limited to the next 3 bullets in the revolver when choosing your next shot. This makes the process of actually navigating your shots, and choosing when to reload a big part of your overarching strategy, which I really enjoyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The visuals, and music were also killer. I mean…just look at it. The use of cell-shading really works wonders here for giving <em>Barrel Roll</em> a striking appearance to set itself apart from other games. And the twangy Western sounds alongside a classic rock guitar riff for the main battle theme was chef’s kiss.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="xanthiom-2">Xanthiom 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A Metroidvania with open-ended exploration where you customize your weapon on the fly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp; </strong>It’s a quiet, moody Metroidvania. That’s basically my favourite breed of this sort of thing, and <em>Xanthiom 2</em> hit all the right notes for me. Doubly so since I was able to explore as I saw fit following the briefest of tutorials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well…okay that’s a bit of a misnomer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would’ve been able to explore as I saw fit, but the demo was limited in scope to just a handful of areas. Despite this, I still managed to find the entrances to 3 different areas that were off limits in the demo, which I’m going to take as meaning that I <em>could </em>have explored more freely were I not playing a demo. It was a promising sign, and has me hopeful that the full game will actually let me roam freely even if I get myself killed in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other really neat thing here was the return of modular gun customization from the original game. This lets players tweak the properties of their weapon for both puzzle solving, and combat related challenges. For example, one of the doors in the demo requires your weapon to have both a 50% range increase, and 50% fire rate increase mod installed to trigger the locking mechanism. It’s a really neat system with a ton of potential, and I’m keen to see exactly how it’s leveraged throughout the full game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think it’s high time I finally get around to the original game, <em>Xanthiom Zero</em>, which I’ve been meaning to play for a couple of months now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cairn">Cairn</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A game about rock climbing. I promise that’s way more interesting than I just made it sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>It’s a little surprising to me that it took until (relatively) recently for games to start exploring rock climbing as a form of movement. In my mind, it shares a lot of overlap with one of video gaming’s oldest genres: platforming. The core difference being that you’re deciding where to place your character’s hands, instead of where to place your character’s feet. In both cases, there is a large focus on movement, and figuring out how to reach your destination with said movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there’ve been an array of indie titles released over the past few years to rectify this shortcoming from <em>Valley Peaks</em>, to <em>Jusant</em>, to <em>PEAK</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, thus far there hasn’t been a game that’s tried to realistically simulate the experience of rock climbing. All of those aforementioned titles sacrifice realism for accessibility, and a smoother gameplay experience. That is not the case for <em>Cairn</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say that <em>Cairn </em>is painfully realistic would be an understatement. When you misplace your footing, you fall. When you land, it hurts. A lot. And the injuries impede your ability to climb back up to where you fell from. Plus you’ll need to keep Aava, <em>Cairn’s </em>protagonist, fed and hydrated because she’ll build up fatigue a lot faster without any fuel in the tank, which will only make climbing harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you know what? There’s a strange sort of serenity born out of accepting all of this, and silently overcoming it. I had a few tumbles, but I kept getting back up until I eventually conquered the demo. This all left me with the impression that <em>Cairn </em>will be an almost meditative experience for a certain type of person, and I think that I’m here for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, if anyone from the development team happens to read this: y’all need someone, or a team of someones to make the game run a smidge better. I ran into a lot of performance issues with the demo, despite running it on the lowest settings. I eventually managed to get a stable framerate, but using the flashlight at night still tanked performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it’d be a shame if optimization related shenanigans mire the reception to <em>Cairn </em>as it’s a really interesting experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="crashout-crew">Crashout Crew</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>a new co-op game from <em>Aggro Crab</em> (the co-creators of <em>PEAK</em>) where you, and up to 4 friends play forklift drivers in a mayhem filled warehouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I feel like I might catch some flack for this (since I didn’t really like <em>PEAK</em>), but I had a lot of fun playing <em>Crashout Crew</em>. I think a lot of that comes down to the common DNA that it shares with <em>Overcooked</em>. Driving around a warehouse to prep a variety of ridiculous deliveries while meteors shower down from the heavens has a very similar energy to the chaotic kitchens of <em>Overcooked’s </em>best levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I do feel like <em>Crashout Crew </em>doesn’t have the same sorts of levers for ratcheting up tension as <em>Overcooked</em>. While playing with my wife, it was very easy to segregate different tasks, so that we never had to actually cross paths with one another. And a lot of the game’s difficulty bottoms out when you’re not crashing into one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that might have been a result of us not using proximity voice chat since we’re sitting less than 10 feet from one another. I have to assume <em>Crashout Crew</em> is a lot more chaotic when you can’t clearly relay information between 2 players who’re constantly on opposite sides of a level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those f-king chickens still got us once they started running around though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I think it’s fair to say that <em>Aggro Crab</em> has the makings of another hit multiplayer game on their hands here. The simplicity of <em>Crashout Crew</em> keeps the skill floor low enough so that anyone with a willing group of friends can jump right in, and have a good time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh right. Hats! The game has funny hats. My favourite thing!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-medium"><img alt="Funny Karen hairstyle from Crashout Crew." class="wp-image-9638" height="293" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/karen-hair.png?w=300" width="300" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>One of them is even this ridiculous Karen looking hair. If that doesn’t make <em>Crashout Crew</em> an all timer then I don’t know what does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, we’re done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m acutely aware of how late I’ll be posting this. Thankfully, most developers leave their demos live after <em>Next Fest</em> concludes, so you should be able to play the demo for any titles that caught your eye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, again, don’t forget about wishlisting. It’s free, and helps a ton.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

Here’s the list of games I was playing throughout September:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#ggst">Guilty Gear Strive</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#sudoku">Sudoku</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; it was a bit of a light month. That’s entirely my fault.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ggst">Guilty Gear Strive</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m sure this will come as a surprise to no one: <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> dominated my gaming time throughout September. The addition of the <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/">newly improved ranked mode</a>, and proper matchmaking made <em>Strive </em>a lot more fun to play when compared against my previous experience with the game. Turns out I’ll actually stick around for longer sessions if I’m not constantly being bombarded by messages about connection failure. Who’d a thunk it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the main draw for my time commitment throughout September was twofold: updating my <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/01/19/guilty-gear-strive-may-guide-for-beginner-combos/">May Beginners Guide</a>, and playing more Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The May guide took about 10 days of on again, off again work to actually hammer through, but I’m fairly pleased with how it turned out. In general, I think the guide does a better job of handing new players safer combo routing that they can use as a springboard for playing May.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also ended up redoing all of the videos for said guide, which meant that I could finally remove all of the background noise. I didn’t even realize it, but <em>Strive </em>plays a wind sound effect passively in the background of every stage. Normally, this extra sound is imperceptible because of the game’s music, but it’s very apparent when you have said music muted so people can’t tell how often you’re cutting between shots in an edited combo video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, those videos feel like they’re better put together now. It was definitely worth the effort even though it took me over a day’s worth of effort to capture, edit, and render 22 new videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing the May guide, my attention fell squarely on Dizzy. Originally, I’d intended to keep bouncing back and forth between her, and May. However, I had so much fun playing Dizzy that I just kept playing her, and eventually reached parity between the 2. At least, that’s true as far as my online ranking is concerned. I’m still far more comfortable using May in bracket, and am much better at putting together loose spaghetti combos with May than I am with Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Dizzy is far more fun to play now than she was before, which I was really surprised by. I wrote about it in length <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/09/27/revisiting-dizzy-at-the-end-of-strive-season-4/">here</a>, but the short version is that Dizzy has more situations where she can score a knockdown which increases her consistency. This is a stark contrast to when Dizzy first launched, and stray hits wouldn’t result in any follow through unless you had Ice Field active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I won’t profess to be an expert, I have had a lot of fun using Dizzy’s different tools to completely lock down my opponents. Nothing feels quite like keeping someone jailed at the far end of the screen while they helplessly flail around. Doubly so because smothering someone to death is non-trivial thanks to the bevy of movement options that exist. I guess Totsu was right all those months ago when he told me that I’d probably enjoy playing a zoner in <em>Strive</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I think the biggest takeaway here is that I’ve been enjoying the process of learning again. Fighting games, specifically <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, were starting to feel really stagnant for me over the past few months. Returning to <em>Strive</em>, and focusing (mostly) on a new character have helped to really reignite my passion for the genre. I think there might be something to that, but I’d prefer to explore it in detail within a dedicated post, so I’ll put a pin in that for later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sudoku">Sudoku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; I’ve continued to play <em>Sudoku</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t have a whole lot to say on this front, but I’ve gotten a lot better at solving the <em>NYT</em>, and <em>LA Times’</em> boards by sticking to Schneider notation. This involves only marking out when a number can appear in 2 different cells within a box, row, or column. The main advantage here is that you don’t clutter the entire <em>Sudoku </em>board with information that can’t be acted upon, while also providing yourself with better information to fill in additional spaces whenever you place another number.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This video probably explains it better, honestly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, as someone who typically struggles to solve boards when there are too many candidates listed across several spaces, I really like Schneider notation. It makes many of these more challenging puzzles a lot more approachable than they were when I’d get buried in the weeds of numerous different candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is an unfortunate downside of Schneider notation: it forced me to learn at a pace that I didn’t find particularly accommodating. Schneider notation is heavily reliant on the <em>Sudoku </em>player’s ability to reliably spot, and infer intersections while solving the puzzle in question. As a result, I had to get a LOT better at spotting this pattern so I could actually make use of this particular solving strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, it’s cool that I can use Schneider notation as I find it far easier to solve puzzles by using it. On the other hand, I’d have appreciated a more gradual build up to this point. Instead, I feel like I immediately rushed hard mode, which added a lot of friction to the entire learning process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, <em>Sudoku </em>is still very fun, and very satisfying. I’d highly recommend checking it out, especially if you’re looking for a way to give your brain a daily mental workout.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like so many other people, I was playing <em>Silksong </em>throughout September. What might surprise you is that I didn’t start playing it until the 20th, so I’ve not actually finished the game yet. I do think I’m over the halfway mark though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also going to skip actually introducing what <em>Silksong </em>is because I’m assuming everyone, and their dog already knows about this game. It was the source of many memes, and much speculative hype right up until it came out. This was swiftly followed by people complaining about the game being too hard, which I can&#8217;t comment on because I started playing it after the first difficulty nerf patch went live.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, <em>Silksong </em>is a game of high peaks, and low valleys for me. The areas where it meaningfully improves upon its predecessor make <em>Silksong </em>among one of my favourite games to bless the Metroidvania subgenre. However, there are a few aspects of <em>Silksong </em>that I actively question because they repeatedly interrupt the flow of exploration, and largely contribute to it feeling like a less well put together package than its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I kind of want to cover off exactly what I mean by all of that in a longer post, but I’m afraid I’ll get lost in the weeds while writing so here’s the Cliff’s notes version:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>The music by Chris Larkin is fantastic</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The wider variety of environments, and greater use of colour are a welcome change</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hornet’s movement abilities feel fantastic to use, and help to immediately distinguish her from the previous title’s hero</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enemy and boss designs (both visual, and mechanical) are great</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The newly added Crest system provides a much needed revamp to the Badge system of the previous title</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Side quests actively detract from the game, and feel like unnecessary padding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The propensity for <em>Silksong </em>to lock players into combat arenas with a deluge of common enemies is boring, predictable, and also feels like unnecessary padding</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, I’ve been having a lot of fun exploring every corner of the game, but I can’t shake the feeling that <em>Silksong </em>is collapsing under its own weight. It feels a lot more overtly video game-y, and bloated in the way that open world games do thanks to the inclusion of really nebulous side quests, and combat arenas. When I’m able to quietly explore, and untangle its labyrinthine maze of a world, I’m at my happiest. However, <em>Silksong </em>seems hellbent on ensuring that those moments are few and far between thanks to an endless deluge of unnecessary interruptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully that explains what I meant by high peaks, and low valleys.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I decided that I wanted something less action-y to play in my evenings so I started up <em>Strange Horticulture</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I say that, but I also wanted to see if I even enjoyed the game. The reason being is Mir wanted to play the sequel, <em>Strange Antiquities</em>, alongside me instead of playing it alone like she did with the first game. As such, I’ve been working my way through <em>Strange Horticulture</em> the past few evenings, so I could give an informed yay or nay to that request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who were as blissfully unaware of this game as I was, <em>Strange Horticulture</em> is a game where you run a shop by the same name, which sells strange plants. Unfortunately, none of the plants are actually labelled, so it’s your job to research, and deduce which plants are which. Ergo, this is a bit of a Detective game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, most of the puzzles haven’t been that involved, and it doesn’t seem like that’ll change either. Instead, the occult story that’s been brewing in the background is starting to take hold, so that appears like it’ll be the focus of the back half of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little disappointed by the lack of puzzles, but I am keen to see where the story goes. Hopefully <em>Strange Horticulture</em> can wrap things up in a satisfying sort of way before I completely check out due to the lack of puzzle variety, and challenge though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for whether I’ll play the sequel with my wife, I guess you’ll have to tune in next month to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, I think we’ll call it for September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, as always, for reading if you made it this far, and stay safe out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

The announcement and release of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/07/23/every-card-is-a-puzzle-in-monster-train-2/">Monster Train 2</a></em> was totally unexpected, <em>Silksong </em>&amp; <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/06/19/surface-runs-add-a-fresh-new-twist-to-hades-2/">Hades 2</a></em> both shadow dropped this month, and <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/"><em>Strive </em>received a proper ranked mode</a> 4 years after its initial release. There were also games like <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/09/02/month-in-review-duck-detective-peak-grounded-2-more/#ooo">Öoo</a></em>, <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/29/tactical-space-invaders-starvaders-review/">StarVaders</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/07/genius-deduction-the-roottrees-are-dead-review/">The Roottrees are Dead</a></em> which totally blew me away despite the limited fanfare they received in the lead up to their respective launch dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, 2025 doesn’t appear to be slowing down with the surprises because a demo for <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> dropped 2 weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who aren’t already aware, this is the next project from <em>Radical Fish Games</em>, the creators of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2018/11/21/crosscode-review/">CrossCode</a></em>. Yes &#8211; that <em>CrossCode</em>. The same <em>CrossCode </em>with gorgeous pixel art, fantastic puzzle-filled dungeons, and one of the most heartfelt narratives that I’ve ever experienced in a video game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say that I’m a little excited about <em>Radical Fish Games’</em> next project would be an understatement. Learning about, and subsequently playing the demo for <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> was akin to my experience with <em>Monster Train 2</em> earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, said demo has fanned the flames of my excitement, and now I’m very much looking forward to the <em>Early Access</em> release of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>, which is (currently) slated for the first half of 2026.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself (again).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome back to another <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/tag/demo-dive/">Demo Dive</a></em> where today we’ll be taking a look at <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>, <em>Radical Fish Games’</em> follow-up to <em>CrossCode</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, let’s start by answering the question: what is <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to <em>CrossCode</em>, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> is an Action RPG with many of the trappings of RPGs from the 16-bit era. That is to say it has the simple, but satisfying combat of something like <em>Diablo</em>, but the narrative structure and cadence of something like <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, or <em>Earthbound</em>. It’s a blending that works quite well for someone like myself who has little patience for simple turn-based combat, but otherwise doesn’t mind the winding narrative structure typical in this sort of RPG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I appreciated some of the changes that <em>Radical Fish</em> has made when compared to their previous work namely as it relates to combat. If memory serves, <em>CrossCode </em>was very button mashy in the combat department with a simple 3 hit combo, alongside a handful of special moves. By comparison, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> features a few more combo types, which players can access by inputting their attacks with a slightly different rhythm. It’s akin to how many other 2D action games have implemented their combo systems, and it makes a welcome appearance here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> features several weapon types which each have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, the sword is fast, but deals less damage than the bulky hammer making it ideal for players who want to attack more aggressively. However, the sword only deals slicing damage, which makes it totally ineffective against enemies with tough shells. That’s where the hammer will come in handy. As such, players need to adjust their approach in combat to account for the different weaknesses of what they’re fighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a really big fan of this addition as it makes combat just that little bit more involved. It’s not so overbearing as to become the focus of the game, but it does lend itself to making fights feel like an active component of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> instead of the thing you do to fill time in between everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from combat, the other aspects that <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo was keen to showcase are the return of Zelda-esque dungeons, and the narrative hook for the story. Unfortunately, you’re only allowed to explore the first dungeon up to the point where you unlock the dungeon’s key item, meaning that the majority of the interesting puzzles, and combat encounters are locked beyond the confines of the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I wouldn’t be upset about being cut off were I not having fun. What’s on offer was really enjoyable even if it was limited in scope. Besides, <em>CrossCode </em>has some of the best constructed puzzle dungeons that I’ve ever played through, so I have every confidence that <em>Radical Fish</em> will deliver in full force with this area of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final bit that I wanted to touch on with regard to <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo is the story. I won’t be speaking about the specifics &#8211; the demo is around 2 hours long, so you can play it yourself if you’re curious. Instead, I wanted to focus on how <em>Radical Fish</em> smartly uses hooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The demo begins with a brief introduction that speaks of a world ending apocalypse (named Nyx), which is swiftly followed by a tutorial section wherein you play as some of the chosen heroes meant to repel said apocalypse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things don’t quite work out though, so everything is a little out of sorts once players take control of <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> protagonist Juno.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then learn that Juno was meant to be travelling with the group of heroes we saw during the tutorial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my money, this setup was perfect. It immediately introduced the game world, set up 2 different sources of conflict, and left me with questions that I’m interested in pursuing the answers to. For example, why wasn’t Juno with the party of chosen heroes? That immediately introduces some intrigue, while also setting up a source of conflict to build the story around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might sound like I’m praising <em>Radical Fish</em> for doing the bare minimum, but you’d be surprised just how many games get this wrong. Basically any author worth their salt knows this sort of introduction is an easy way to draw the reader into your story. It gives them something to latch onto so they can cruise through the remaining character introductions throughout the opening act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, writing is rarely the focal point for many games. As such, games are usually a lot more reliant on visual set pieces, or mechanical complexity for drawing players in. It’s for this reason that I found <em>Radical Fish’s</em> use of narrative hooks so refreshing. Doubly so since it communicated to me that they’re looking to make the story of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> as much of a focal point as it was in <em>CrossCode</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, I’m typically a much more mechanically minded player &#8211; I think even a cursory glance at my other written work will reveal as much &#8211; so <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> getting its narrative hooks into me has gotta count for something, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I close out here, there are 2 other things that I wanted to (briefly) mention: the artwork, and music. I already thought <em>Radical Fish’s</em> previous work looked great, but the pixel art, and character animation are even more well done here. It’s almost unbelievable how good the game looks. Kudos to the art team!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along those same lines, I thought all of the music within <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo was great. Every track fit the accompanying locale, cutscene, or set piece to a tee which did a lot of heavy lifting for setting the appropriate tone throughout the demo. Again, big kudos to the folks responsible for the music as you absolutely nailed the assignment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that I think I’ve covered everything that I wanted to say about <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>. Obviously, I’m coming at it from the lens of someone who both played, and really enjoyed <em>CrossCode</em>, which might not be true for all of you. I feel like the demo showed that <em>Radical Fish</em> are doubling down on what made <em>CrossCode </em>so great, and I’m very eager to get my hands on the full release whenever they finish cooking it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I’ll have to wait a fair bit as <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> is planned for an <em>Early Access</em> launch in the first half of 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, if you’d like to check out the demo for yourself &#8211; and I think you should as it’s fantastic &#8211; then you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3110760/Alabaster_Dawn/">here via <em>Steam</em></a>. Also, don’t forget to wishlist the game if you enjoy the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

My general takeaways were mostly negative even though I found her really fun to play. There were a lot of small reasons for that, but the biggest unifying theme of my complaints was that her design felt muddled. Her tools seemed built with zoning in mind, but she was fairly mediocre at keep-out. She wasn’t much better at traditional strike-throw offense either, which left Dizzy in this weird limbo state where she couldn’t do anything particularly well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t the only person who came to this conclusion about Dizzy either. Over the next several weeks, countless tier lists were published by different notable players, and every single one of them put Dizzy in the bottom tier. Heck, some even said she was the worst character in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this isn’t the first time that people have claimed a newly released character was the worst in <em>Strive</em>, so it’s important to take such claims with a grain of salt. Infamously, some said that Happy Chaos was trash when he was first released. In the following months, Happy Chaos crept to the top of most player’s tier lists, and also won <em>EVO </em>2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, in fairness, that <em>EVO </em>win came after Happy Chaos received totally unnecessary buffs to the majority of his attacking moves. This was done as a way to compensate for a nerf to the character’s zoning capabilities, but many considered this change a massive net positive for the Happy Chaos playerbase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the point remains that many people had grossly underestimated the strength of Happy Chaos upon his initial release. As such, it wasn’t unreasonable to think that myself, and others might have missed the mark with Dizzy too. Perhaps there was something we’d missed that would unlock the true potential of the character.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as weeks turned into months, people continued to nod their head in agreement about Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, this was extremely vindicating. I don’t always have the most confidence in my opinions as it relates to Fighting games, so it was nice to see a bunch of other players (at various levels of play) all coming to the same conclusion that I did with my initial assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this also kind of sucked because I really enjoyed playing Dizzy (when she worked). That sort of sentiment shouldn’t ever stop you from playing a character that you enjoy, but it’s hard to maintain a consistent level of enthusiasm when you’re reminded how much easier it’d be to just play somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there were 2 major balance patches to <em>Strive </em>between when I last played Dizzy and now. Surely, <em>Arc System Works</em> buffed her to a point where she can actually compete, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>…Right?</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Guilty Gear Strives version 1.43 patch notes for Dizzy where she was nerfed just as much as she was buffed." class="wp-image-9603" height="508" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dizzy-patch-notes-v-143.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Guys?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All joking aside, here’s the list of (relevant) changes that Dizzy received across those 2 patches:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>For Roasting Chestnuts (236K)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>First hit no longer counts as a projectile &amp; hitbox size increased</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Causes a knockdown on hit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can now neutralize other projectiles</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Far Slash (f.S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Increased hitbox</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crouching Slash (2S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Increased hitbox</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Michael Sword (214S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Causes a knockdown on hit</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I Used This to Catch Fish (236S|H)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>More than doubled the active frames of the attack</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frozen State\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>No longer (erroneously) triggers a wall break</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a change that buffed the power of Yellow Roman Cancel, and damage was nerfed across the board. Both of these changes were huge for Dizzy since it increased her defensive utility, and brought her damage output inline with the rest of the cast. In fact, you could reasonably argue that Dizzy was one of the biggest beneficiaries of both changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, after a few more weeks of playing Dizzy, what do I think of her now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a short video that I believe accurately captures my impressions:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This character is a lot better at zoning now. Her tools actually compliment one another thanks to the additional knockdown opportunities afforded by both versions of Michael Sword, and Chestnut. In all cases, Dizzy has the option to set up additional projectiles, Wings of Light, or Ice Field which allows her to run her gameplan a lot more consistently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, she has stronger tools (namely For Roasting Chestnuts) for challenging the other cast members when she gets into a zoning war. This means that she doesn’t feel completely defenseless like she used to when she had to rely solely on I Used This to Catch Fish, which was too slow to meaningfully challenge most of the cast with any degree of consistency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the massive buff to I Used This to Catch Fish is certainly the highlight of the current patch, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find the changes to Chestnut from the previous patch to be more impactful. It’s actually wild how much mileage I can get out of this special attack now. It helps to keep folks locked down, and the added knockdown makes it very easy to consistently place Ice Field. This is notable as the added icy terrain makes it much harder for opponents to approach Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I can’t overlook the changes to I Used This to Catch Fish. The almost <em>40 frames</em> that this attack is active for is insane. I’ve caught so many people off guard with this attack because it’s active for so long. I think it sits firmly in gimmick territory, but I’d be lying if I said that it wasn’t an effective gimmick. And that makes it a nice option to exercise, especially against players who’re unfamiliar with Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also loving the hitbox changes on Dizzy’s Slash normals. The extended hitbox on Far Slash has led to several instances where I’ve had it clash with an opponent’s reversal (invulnerable get-off me attacks like Shoryuken), which led to an advantageous follow-up for me. This is the sort of power I was used to wielding while playing May, and having it now on Dizzy has made her feel a lot better overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Crouching Slash is basically just May’s Crouching Slash from before it was nerfed to be 10% slower. That attack was best-in-class prior to the nerf, so Dizzy having an equally strong attack here feels so good. Plus, Crouching Slash was (it still is, honestly) my favourite way to control space with May, and it works just as well on Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All said, I think Dizzy is in a much better place now than she was when she first released. She feels like a solid middle of the pack character, with well defined strengths to accompany her many weaknesses. She has a very strong presence from everywhere on the screen, and can easily suffocate her opponent after she builds up some momentum. That said, all of her attacks have exploitable dead zones, and she still struggles to cover the space above her head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I’ve continued to have a ton of fun playing Dizzy. More so than before I’d wager. I wasn’t expecting much given how few changes she’s received over the past year, but it seems like those changes targeted the areas where Dizzy needed the most help. Now she feels like a strong zoner with unique tools, instead of direction-less generalist with meagre damage output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also felt comfortable enough to use Dizzy last week in bracket at locals, and I won all 5 games where I played her. Granted, I was still playing May for the majority of my games, but it was nice to finally show off the work I’ve been putting in with Dizzy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s hoping that I continue to have fun as I progress even further with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

I have a really hard time empathizing with how tricky someone else will find different types of puzzles. That can make it hard to communicate exactly why a particular Puzzle game did or did not work for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as an example, my friends Charlie and Thomas are both very logical thinkers, and can juggle a bunch of abstract information in their minds. As a result, they find a lot of Puzzle games far too simple. There’ve been very few instances over the years where I’ve recommended a Puzzle game to either of them, and had them come back saying they actually enjoyed it. Instead, I usually get hit with, “It was neat, but a little too simple.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So…you know…that doesn’t exactly make me very confident in my abilities to recommend Puzzle games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I finished a demo for <em>The Art of Reflection</em> earlier this week, and I had to talk about it. Mostly because it is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, I’ll start Demo Dive with a brief overview of <em>The Art of Reflection</em>, though I think the attached trailer does a fairly good job of showcasing what the game is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Art of Reflection</em> is a First-Person Puzzle game with realistically simulated mirrors. Also, you can enter the mirrors. This is the foundation from which <em>The Art of Reflection</em> builds all of its puzzles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a quick example of exactly what that entails, 1 of the first puzzles that players are asked to solve in the demo involves a locked door, and a key. Unfortunately, the door requires a mirrored version of the key that you’re provided with. Luckily, you can pop through a mirror, grab a mirrored version of the key, and return to the original door which you’ll now be able to open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s notes: I only realized after the fact that this is the first puzzle in the trailer, and now feel like a doofus for using it as an example. Still &#8211; you get the idea!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a fairly basic puzzle, but that should give you an idea of what <em>The Art of Reflection</em> has going on. It’s puzzles built around reflection, and perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, I was a little dubious about how much mileage the developers <a href="https://x.com/hydrozoagames">Hydrozoa</a> could get out of that idea, but the demo did a lot to assuage my concerns. Every new room I entered either presented a completely new idea, or meaningfully built upon a previous puzzle. That gave the whole demo a great sense of momentum, and also made the whole thing very satisfying to unravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I do have to call out my favourite moment from the demo, so skip this paragraph if you don’t want to be spoiled. The first time I entered a mirror on the ceiling, and inverted gravity was so cool. I was not expecting that at all, but playing around with gravity by flipping the entire world upside down was a really neat twist on the game’s core mechanics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also got the sense that I missed a few different puzzles throughout the demo. There were these collectible pillars that you were awarded for completing several consecutive rooms. Each one seemed to increase the amount of music playing for all of the levels attached to a particular hub. I figured that the demo didn’t contain all of the levels, specifically so the developers could showcase the breadth of ideas that they had, but the message at the end of the demo makes me think that I just missed several puzzles that were hidden off the beaten path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that’s the case, that’s also really neat. I’m always a fan of Puzzle games hiding additional puzzles behind these sorts of challenges. It’s a bit of a twist on simply solving a level to unlock the next since you need to work out exactly where the hidden thing is in the first place. That’s a commitment to puzzle solving that I can appreciate in a Puzzle game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you miss those hidden levels, it’s not really a big deal? Most Puzzle games are satisfying to solve irrespective of whether or not you completed all of their most tricky conundrums. Hell, most players won’t even notice that they’ve missed anything unless you tell them. My experience is proof positive of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I think <em>The Art of Reflection</em> looks very promising. The demo has certainly wet my appetite for the full game, which releases on November 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to try <em>The Art of Reflection</em> for yourself, there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2290770/The_Art_of_Reflection/">demo currently available on Steam</a>. And don’t forget to wishlist the game if you enjoyed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

I don’t know exactly what happened, but Mir’s machine died on Sunday, so fixing that became my sole focus for the day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After testing most of the components individually, I narrowed the problem down to the board, CPU, or PSU. Admittedly, I was too lazy to test the 3 of them because the PSU was out of warranty (so it was due for a replacement anyway), and you’re saddled with replacing the board and CPU simultaneously. So we set off to the local parts store thinking we needed to pick up 3 things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I forgot that we’d need a new AIO watercooler that fits an AM5 socket CPU. Also, the new boards aren’t compatible with DDR4 memory, so we were forced to upgrade that too. And Mir’s case was too small for all the new fixtures, so we rectified that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, after 9 hours of work (testing the parts, buying and delivering the new parts, deconstructing the old machine, and building the new machine) I finally had a shiny new PC built for wifey. Thankfully, it worked with very few hiccups, though it did need to have network adapters installed for a wired connection, which I thought was odd. She’s happy though, which is all that matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Mir thought it was a little unfair that she got to upgrade her machine when mine was older, so she also bought me some new parts. For context, I’ve been using a first gen Ryzen (1600X) for basically the entire lifetime of my blog. Very high-end back when I bought it in 2017, but it’s been completely obliterated by the passage of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was my Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, enough of how I was playing computer surgeon for the past 2 days &#8211; here are the highlights for August:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#duck-detective">Duck Detective 1 &amp; 2</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#grounded-2">Grounded 2</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#peak">PEAK</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#sudoku">Sudoku</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#ooo">Öoo</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="duck-detective">Duck Detective 1 &amp; 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As is true for an ever growing number of the titles I’ve written about, I first played <em>Duck Detective</em> during a <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/03/01/steam-next-fest-february-2025-indie-round-up-part-3/">Steam Next Fest</a></em>. The demo was short, but it showed enough of <em>Duck Detective</em> (for both the first, and second game) to convince me that there was something here that I’d enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As luck would have it, that demo didn’t lead me astray, and I had an excellent time playing through both <em>Duck Detective</em> games back-to-back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I didn’t play both games in a single sitting. I played them across 2 days, but I finished either game on the same day that I started it. That should give you a good idea of how much of a time commitment <em>Duck Detective</em> is. They’re the perfect sort of game for a lazy weekend afternoon, or after a mind-numbing day at the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as the games are concerned, both make a great case for blending detective work with elements of comedy. I figured <em>Duck Detective</em> would go more the route of <em>Frog Detective</em>, where the charm and humour are the focus, but both cases required a bit of deductive reasoning to work out. It wasn’t on the same level as something like <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/07/genius-deduction-the-roottrees-are-dead-review/">The Roottrees are Dead</a></em>, but I don’t think it had to be. <em>Duck Detective</em> felt like a Goldilocks level of deduction difficulty, and I appreciated that about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t just the sleuthing that made <em>Duck Detective</em> so good though: the humour also worked well. There’s a few different ways that this manifests, but my favourite was the Duck Detective himself. Sean Chiplock voices the titular detective, and gives a performance akin to a Film Noir detective who smokes a pack a day. Meanwhile, the entire game is colourful, cartoonish, and bubbly. That contrast leads to a ton of smirk worthy moments, and a few laugh-out-loud jokes throughout both games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All said, both <em>Duck Detective</em> games get a thumbs up from me. They’re great bite-sized Detective games, and I’m very much looking forward to the third installment that I assume is coming thanks to the cliffhanger ending of the second game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously. I need to know what happens next!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="grounded-2">Grounded 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/18/is-it-wrong-to-support-grounded-2-in-early-access/">Grounded 2</a></em> is the first of 2 different games that I picked up in August specifically to play with my wife. She really enjoys her Survival games, and I like doing things that make her happy. Plus, I enjoyed <em>Grounded </em>well enough, so diving into the sequel wasn’t something I was particularly opposed to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, I think the sequel is shaping up to be better than the first, but it’s obviously fairly bare-bones at the time of writing. There’s a lot of features from the first game that are missing, but planned for the sequel. That led to a number of times where the 2 of us were wondering if we’d missed something we knew existed in the original, or if it wasn’t present in the current <em>Early Access</em> build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To compensate for this, a much greater emphasis has been placed on the newly added Buggys, which are just <em>Grounded’s </em>version of mounts. Though if I’m being perfectly honest, mounts were a really good feature to launch with and build the second game around. We were basically inseparable from Sir Reginald the Domesticated (mine), and Mr Pinchy (Mir’s) once we obtained them. They make travelling so much more convenient, and their ability to carry large volumes of crafting materials was also a huge plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, the addition of mounts made me a lot less inclined to build satellite bases throughout the game world. When you can move <em>that</em> fast, you don’t really need respawn points (or emergency supplies) scattered across the map. I’m of the opinion that this somewhat undermines the survival aspects of <em>Grounded 2</em>, but it does strip out some of the tedium of creating and stocking satellite bases. As such, I don’t want to harp on about it too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also of the opinion that lowering the difficulty, at least during the first few nights, was a net positive. As veteran players, we were a little surprised by the lack of hostility, but it was easy to see how it started ramping up as we explored more of the available space, and started challenging (and defeating) stronger enemies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that, I don’t have terribly strong opinions about the rest of the changes from the first game. Most of it was either a “that’s neat”, or “I preferred this in the first game”. In either case, I wasn’t moved to the point where I feel like sharing a detailed breakdown of my nitpicks here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as recommendations go, I’d say wait for the game to receive some more updates. I think the few new additions show that <em>Eidos Montreal</em> has a good grasp on what they’re doing with <em>Grounded 2</em>, but I think the experience of actually playing through the game will be better after they’ve had more time to develop it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="peak">PEAK</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second of those 2 aforementioned games that I picked up to play with Mir. Though I’ll be perfectly honest here: I had no interest in playing <em>PEAK</em>. I know that it’s taken the whole world by storm, but I just…it didn’t look like something I’d enjoy playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those not in the know, <em>PEAK </em>is a game where you play as plane crash survivors, and need to ascend a mountain to signal for a rescue. You go through 4 different biomes, which make no logical sense, but it does provide different gameplay challenges that make the journey fairly interesting. For example, the second area, a jungle, rains constantly which makes it significantly harder to climb up the sheer cliff faces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, one night at dinner, Mir was lamenting how she was frustrated that she could never reach the eponymous peak with her regular cluster of friends. Luckily, <em>PEAK </em>was on sale that very same day, so I bought it, and said I’d help her to reach the top of the mountain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am happy to report that I have a 50% winrate at <em>PEAK</em>, and I made my wife very happy when we reached the top of the mountain during our second run playing together. I then promptly uninstalled the game because I was 100% right in my original assessment: <em>PEAK </em>is not for me. Though it was nice to help my wife, especially as I got to hear her bragging about it (over a <em>Discord </em>call) the next day with her friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hooooo boy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, <em>Is This Seat Taken</em> was another title I covered from <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/02/26/steam-next-fest-february-2025-indie-round-up-part-1/">Next Fest</a></em>, and it was one of my favourites from the particular event that it debuted at. I was really impressed with the variety of ways that developer <em>Poti Poti Games</em> managed to utilize the core mechanic of placing shapes around a level based on their seating preferences. Doubly so because of how some of your decisions would have cascading effects on future problems within the level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, there is a level in a film festival where certain movie-goers have popcorn. They’ll leave a bit of a mess behind in their seats though, which will interfere with your ability to place shapes who don’t like messy seats leading to some interesting cross-puzzle problem solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the full game doesn’t evolve much beyond the confines of what’s shown off within the demo. This was a fairly large disappointment if I’m being perfectly honest. There is so much variety in those first few levels, but you end up revisiting a lot of the same locations over, and over throughout <em>Is This Seat Taken</em> with the only real differences being that a few additional seating preferences have been added to the mix. This gives the whole game a rather flat difficulty curve, and makes it feel quite repetitive by the time credits roll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have similar opinions about the game’s story. Conceptually, I like it. Having a story about finding your place in the world gels really nicely with a game that’s literally about finding the best place for everyone to sit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the story moves at a really languid pace, and feels far too stretched out to be satisfying. I appreciated what was there, but I think the delivery would benefit from a tighter script, and delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, and it pains me to say this, I don’t know that I’d recommend <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> If it was a little tighter than I probably would, but it’s a little too drawn out for my taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sudoku">Sudoku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t originally going to include this, but I spent more time playing <em>Sudoku </em>this past month than I spent playing…anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I already wrote a whole article about it, but I’ve since progressed well beyond the point where I was while writing. I’ve completed the Hard puzzle on <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku">NYT</a> </em>for the past 2 weeks, and have done the past 14 Expert, and Impossible difficulty <em>Sudokus </em>over on <em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/games/sudoku">LA Times</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my money, the coolest part of this whole thing has been learning different solving proofs. What I mean by that is that there are certain patterns that you can apply to reduce the number of potential candidates for a specific space on the board beyond the standard <em>Sudoku </em>rules. I already touched on that a bit in my article, but I’ve had to learn several additional proofs while solving these harder puzzles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most satisfying part of this whole journey has been actually applying those proofs on future puzzles though. It’s almost like learning a new combo in a fighting game, or a new card combo in a deck-builder that improves your odds of success. Though, I’ll fully admit that I don’t always understand the internal logic for all of the proofs that I use, but I know that they work, and I can visually identify them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, I’m glad that I started doing <em>Sudoku </em>puzzles daily because they’re really satisfying to solve in a way that very few other things in my day-to-day life are. It kind of reminds me of programming if I’m being honest. Though without all the bullshit that regularly made my old office job brain-rotting instead of fulfilling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ooo">Öoo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming from the developer of <em>Elechead</em>, Nama Takahashi, <em>Öoo </em>is another great puzzle game where Takahashi takes a single idea, and runs with it to the ends of the Earth. In this case, you play as a caterpillar adjacent creature, and you place bombs that you can explode at will. The result is an incredibly satisfying puzzle-platformer that’s filled to the brim with excellent puzzles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the moment where <em>Öoo </em>went from good to great, for me, was when I hit my first dead-end. The game’s structured like a Metroidvania, so reaching that final empty room felt really anticlimactic. Everything about the game’s design language was saying that there should have been a reward here &#8211; like a new power-up &#8211; for all my effort in reaching this room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s when it hit me: I already got the power-up. In order to even reach the room in question, I had to first learn a new way to use my bombs. Then there were several consecutive rooms with puzzles built around reaffirming my understanding of this new technique. That was the reward: new knowledge that I didn’t previously possess.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That dead-end after a series of puzzles wasn’t a 1 off occurrence either: it happened another 7 times. There’s a term that I’ve heard used to describe games like this &#8211; Metroid-brainias &#8211; and <em>Öoo </em>fits squarely within that niche. All of your different “power-ups” are knowledge based, which makes them really satisfying to discover, and apply throughout the game’s world. I’m a sucker for this sort of thing, so I had a really great time working my way through each level of <em>Öoo</em>, while learning everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, I love how Takahashi wordlessly teaches all of these concepts to the player. I feel like teaching through level design has become a bit of a lost art, so seeing that on full display throughout <em>Öoo </em>was really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, <em>Öoo </em>comes highly recommended. It’s about 2 hours for a standard playthrough, and it’ll make you feel very satisfied as you work through its various quandaries. Though, I think it is limited to a <em>Steam </em>release at the moment, but I’d hazard a guess that it’ll make its way to <em>Switch </em>at some point like <em>Elechead </em>did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, I think I’ll call it for August. I was going to write a section about <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> as well, but I think the article I wrote last week <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/">gushing about the newly added Ranked Match mode</a> says it all. It’s great. It’s the best <em>Strive </em>I’ve played in a very long time. I’m happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, I don’t know exactly what I’ll be covering throughout September. There’s a few revisions I’m making to my <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/01/19/guilty-gear-strive-may-guide-for-beginner-combos/">May guide</a> in tandem with the newly dropped seasonal updates for <em>Strive</em>, but that’ll be imperceptible to most of my readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess just keep checking back here periodically, or consider subscribing for email notifications. That’ll let you know whenever a new post goes live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you as always for reading, and I’ll see you in the next one.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

There was no way I could do it on my own; I begged management for help and got 2 more developers on board. After we\'d released our first major rewrite and fix, there were still a few lingering issues that seemed unrelated to our code. So I began investigating the cause.</p>\n\n<p>This system has 10+ microservices which are connected like meatballs buried deep within a bowl of spaghetti that completely obscures what those meatballs are even doing. Untangling this code has been a chore in and of itself. Within the 3 microservices dedicated to automated tasks, I found a lot of random functionality ... and then I found <i>this!</i></p>\n\n<p>See, our system extracts data from your API. It takes the refresh token, requests a new access token, and saves it to our database. Our refresh token to this system is only valid for 24 hours; as soon as we get access, we download the data. Before we download the data, we ensure we have a valid access token by refreshing it.</p>\n\n<p>One of our microservice\'s pointless jobs was to refresh the access token every 5, 15, and 30 minutes for 22 of the 24 hours we had access to it. It was on a job timer, so it just kept going. Every single consent for that day kept getting refreshed, over and over.</p>\n\n<p>Your auditing tools must not have revealed us as the culprit, otherwise we should\'ve heard about this much sooner. You\'ve probably wasted countless hours of your lives sifting through log files with a legion of angry managers breathing down your necks. I’m writing to let you know we killed the thing. You won’t get spammed again on our watch. May this bring you some closure.</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n\n<p>A Developer Who Still Cares</p><div>\n\t<img src="https://thedailywtf.com/images/inedo/proget-icon.png" style="display: block; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" /> [Advertisement] \n\tKeep the plebs out of prod.

No one ever took on the task of fixing its numerous underlying design flaws.</p>\n\n<p style="float: right; padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spam_wall_-_Flickr_-_freezelight.jpg" title="freezelight, CC BY-SA 2.0 &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons"><img alt="Spam wall - Flickr - freezelight" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Spam_wall_-_Flickr_-_freezelight.jpg/512px-Spam_wall_-_Flickr_-_freezelight.jpg?20200705235344" width="300" /></a></p>\n\n\n<p>About 6 months ago, I was put in charge of this thing and told to fix it. There was no way I could do it on my own; I begged management for help and got 2 more developers on board. After we\'d released our first major rewrite and fix, there were still a few lingering issues that seemed unrelated to our code. So I began investigating the cause.</p>\n\n<p>This system has 10+ microservices which are connected like meatballs buried deep within a bowl of spaghetti that completely obscures what those meatballs are even doing. Untangling this code has been a chore in and of itself. Within the 3 microservices dedicated to automated tasks, I found a lot of random functionality ... and then I found <i>this!</i></p>\n\n<p>See, our system extracts data from your API. It takes the refresh token, requests a new access token, and saves it to our database. Our refresh token to this system is only valid for 24 hours; as soon as we get access, we download the data. Before we download the data, we ensure we have a valid access token by refreshing it.</p>\n\n<p>One of our microservice\'s pointless jobs was to refresh the access token every 5, 15, and 30 minutes for 22 of the 24 hours we had access to it. It was on a job timer, so it just kept going. Every single consent for that day kept getting refreshed, over and over.</p>\n\n<p>Your auditing tools must not have revealed us as the culprit, otherwise we should\'ve heard about this much sooner. You\'ve probably wasted countless hours of your lives sifting through log files with a legion of angry managers breathing down your necks. I’m writing to let you know we killed the thing. You won’t get spammed again on our watch. May this bring you some closure.</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n\n<p>A Developer Who Still Cares</p><div>\n\t<img src="https://thedailywtf.com/images/inedo/proget-icon.png" style="display: block; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" /> [Advertisement] \n\tKeep the plebs out of prod.

Let me know if the tests highlight anything for you."</p>\n<p>The bug ticket vanished into the ether for many weeks. Eventually, the product owner replied. Their team had diagnosed the problem, and the root cause was that sometimes the API would get confused about record ownership and identity. It was a tricky problem to crack, but the product owner\'s developers had come up with a novel solution to resolve it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actually we could add a really unique id instead which would never get repeated, even across customers, it would stay the same for the entity and never be reused</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And thus, the vendor invented primary keys and unique identifiers.

Henrik would send updates, and then try and read back the results, and the changes didn\'t happen. Except sometimes they did. Reads would be inconsistent. It\'d work fine for weeks, and then suddenly things would go off the rails, showing values that no one from Henrik\'s company had put in the database.</p>\n<p>The vendor said, "This is a problem on your side, clearly." Henrik disagreed.</p>\n<p>So Henrik went about talking over the problem with his fellow devs, working with the 3rd party support, and building test cases which could reproduce the results reliably. It took many weeks of effort, but by the end, he was confident he could prove it was the vendor\'s issue.</p>\n<p>"Hey," Henrik said, "I think these tests pretty convincingly show that it\'s a problem on your side. Let me know if the tests highlight anything for you."</p>\n<p>The bug ticket vanished into the ether for many weeks. Eventually, the product owner replied. Their team had diagnosed the problem, and the root cause was that sometimes the API would get confused about record ownership and identity. It was a tricky problem to crack, but the product owner\'s developers had come up with a novel solution to resolve it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actually we could add a really unique id instead which would never get repeated, even across customers, it would stay the same for the entity and never be reused</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And thus, the vendor invented primary keys and unique identifiers. Unfortunately, the vendor was not E.F. Codd, the year was not 1970, primary keys had been invented already, and in fact were well understood and widely used.

Dates and times are arbitrary and we structure them to our convenience.</p>\n<p>If we rewind to ancient Rome, you had the role of Pontifex Maximus. This was the religious leader of Rome, and since honoring the correct feasts and festivals at the right time was part of the job, it was also the standards body which kept the calendar. It was, ostensibly, not a political position, but there was also no rule that an aspiring politician couldn\'t hold both that post and a political post, like consul. This was a loophole Julius Caesar ruthlessly exploited; if his political opposition wanted to have an important meeting on a given day, whoops! The signs and portents tell us that we need to have a festival and no work should be done!</p>\n<p>There\'s no evidence to prove it, but Julius Caesar is exactly the kind of petty that he probably skipped Pompey\'s birthday every year.</p>\n<p>Julius messed around with the calendar a fair bit for political advantage, but the final version of it was the Julian calendar and that was our core calendar for the next 1500 years or so (and in some places, still <em>is</em> the preferred calendar).

I am going to try to record and post content to YouTube, on my own schedule, when I can. I can record sporadically throughout the day here and there when I have the moments, and do the audio at night when the house is a bit more quiet. I can learn how to edit, and still scratch that scheduling itch. I also want to continue to grow with my art, and I&#8217;ve been posting to Cara and Instagram, and doing a little bit of drawing every day. I&#8217;d like to get back on track with my reading journal, and posting updates over on my book blog. I have a lot of FOMO when it comes to streaming. I watch a lot of twitch streamers throughout the day while I do other things. I see their enthusiasm and love for their games and community. I see them get sponsorships, I see them get noticed.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why write it all out here? Well. I just wanted to get it out, honestly.

But I know, beyond any shadow of doubt, if I start down that path Time to Loot would leap from &#8216;all but over&#8217; to &#8216;actually over&#8217;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lack of steam or no, I&#8217;m not quite ready for that!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the decompressing post Blaugust, it has also been a rather busy period at work, with travel, updating the strategic outlook through to 2030 and the tactical level realignment that goes on in the wake of a new strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably more than any of that, <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/">I gained firsthand understanding</a> of why <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/">Bhagpuss</a> has found <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a> has encroached so much on gaming and TV time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suno&#8217;s version 5 model landed this month, mostly calling out clearer vocals and richer sound. Having been playing with &#8216;v4.5+&#8217; beta model before the release, which I have to imagine is essentially the training set for v5, I&#8217;d be lying if I said I noted a significant difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Possibly</em> Suno is a little better at following the in-line lyric style and instrumentation guides given, but hard to be sure given the variances you can get in generation to generation even against the same exact prompts, guides, and &#8216;advanced settings&#8217;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gained access to <a href="https://suno.com/studio-welcome">Suno Studio</a> this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65692" height="517" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-940x517.png" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> RIP free time.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked with Studio on a few songs now, it definitely has a lot of potential, but for my use case and at least currently, carries an equally high number of frustrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of them coming from the fact that &#8216;stem&#8217; extraction is fairly hit and miss, and can introduce sound artifacts that didn&#8217;t exist in the original generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When all I&#8217;m wanting to achieve is to tweak the per-instrument positioning on the sound stage, it&#8217;s fairly irksome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those using it in probably the more &#8216;proper&#8217; fashion, and creating elements from the ground up, I have to imagine it&#8217;s already quite the power house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, moving on to actual games!

Mostly prompted by curiosity as to what  Benedict Jacka had got up to since finishing his <em><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/books/reviews/book-review-risen-by-benedict-jacka/">Alex Verus</a></em> series. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His new series, <em>Inheritance of Magic</em>, seems good! Good enough, anyway, that I pre-ordered the third book for Kindle and wish that I&#8217;d waited a little longer before this particular spot of curiosity struck, as there is going to be a lot of waiting to see this series unfold!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Dan Willis&#8217; <em>Arcane Casebook</em> series to fill the gap. I&#8217;m through two of the five books in the bundle I bought already, and I can tell I&#8217;ll be getting the rest. It&#8217;s a bit of an interesting spin on the genre, too, being set in &#8216;Depression era&#8217; New York, but where magic of various forms has taken the place of certain aspects of technology developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m torn on having Goodreads count it as a single book though. It&#8217;s >1,800 pages for the five books, which is not out of the question but certainly on the longer end of my typical books, but each individual book is shorter than my typical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still- I think I&#8217;ll hit my 15 book target easily enough even counting it as just the one, so eh! :)</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-september-2025/">Time to Loot Journal: September 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com">Time to Loot</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-september-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2', 'post-id': '65691'}

Finding music that resonates with the soul, or at least the big feelings of the moment, is cathartic in a way almost nothing else can be. Even if it does take a bit of mental gymnastics to make every line fit your situation sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a>. You may&#8217;ve heard of it &#8212; but if not, it&#8217;s an AI that can create songs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d heard of it before. But honestly? I had simply assumed it&#8217;d be little more than a toy. Somewhere along the line I got the idea you had to provide your own vocals, and the AI just acted like a souped-up auto-tune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>can</em> use it like that, sure. But you can also simply write your own lyrics and have it go at it. Heck &#8212; if you&#8217;d rather, you don&#8217;t even need to do that. Just describe what you want, like any other LLM, and it&#8217;ll spit out your response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only this time it comes with a soundtrack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://suno.com/s/YfVE4FBgRpdZWnZF"><em>Shadows and Neon</em></a> is one such created in this way. I could not have expended any less effort on it if I <em>tried</em>. I can&#8217;t even recall what my prompt was, but I know I didn&#8217;t even bother prompting for specific styles. I just wasn&#8217;t invested yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it made me sit up and pay attention because I couldn&#8217;t hand on heart tell you I&#8217;d definitely have identified it as AI-generated if I hadn&#8217;t just clicked the &#8216;Create&#8217; button myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thus Starts my Crash Course in Song Construction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I <em>like</em> music, I couldn&#8217;t have told you a few days ago what a &#8216;prechorus&#8217; was (beyond the obvious), or what precisely a &#8216;bridge&#8217; is meant to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of this learning was just feeding in basic prompts and seeing what came out, but I also took a bit of a stab at seeing if I knew enough to take inspiration from other, much better, songs and seeing if Suno could get me anywhere close. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was even reading song and album reviews for crying out loud. It was a bit like learning a new language adjacent to, but not quite the same as the one you&#8217;re native to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/jJSVX5qAs2KcYbK6">What Never Relents</a></em> is one such attempt, where I was looking to see if I could craft a style prompt to hit a similar feel to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUe9UhcUtEI">Specter by Bad Omens</a></em>. It does tickle me that the generated lyrics here used &#8216;Specter&#8217; without specifically being prompted to or given the lyric directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not an unqualified success (particularly not on the vocal stylings), I was, once again, somewhat impressed. And I hadn&#8217;t even realised that you could enfold section-specific direction to vocals and music in the lyrics as well yet!<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-1-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-65184" title="I mean, it will ignore you completely 9 times out of 10, but still, you can!"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Toy to Therapist</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point, a switch flicked. Don’t ask me how or why &#8212; I couldn’t tell you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I do know is that I realised I’d still been treating Suno as a toy, when it was clearly more than that. So… I did something I haven’t done in <em>many</em> years.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-2-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65184" title="Probably not since I was that rock-bashing cave-teen myself."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote something like poetry — only this time, I had a way to give it a soundtrack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we call those songs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because she’d been on my mind a lot lately, I wrote one about my mother. Let me tell you &#8212; I was <em>not</em> ready to hear the words sung back at me. Jesus H. Christ. I&#8217;m uncertain what context to give. Perhaps none, and leave it to what I&#8217;ve already <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/goodbye-mum/">said in the past</a>. Songs are meant to speak for themselves anyway, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hit me harder than I expected. Harder than I was ready for. And yet, I kept working on it. It took a fair bit of finessing of lyrics and style guides to get where I wanted it &#8212; and Suno really does not like being told what to do if you introduce the concept of a second voice &#8212; but I ultimately found my way to this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/zQ6jTxGIw1ClJRnT">The Weight of Love</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s still a sombre piece overall, the more I tweaked, the more small notes of light started slipping in. Verse 3, for example, wasn’t in the first draft at all &#8212; it only emerged as I kept writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, for starters, I think I finally get why some albums feel like they’re circling one idea over and over. Apparently, when something matters, you don’t just&#8230; wring it out in a single track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So of course I had to do another. I had more work through here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just like that, I think I&#8217;m on the path to just creating a whole (virtual) album. Whodathunk? Certainly not me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not blind to the issues such AI technologies pose, whichever side of the fence you sit on. I can&#8217;t say I know how ethically the models have been trained (but&#8230; I could guess).

It no longer asked the reader to think through implications and parallels for themselves and instead became a mallet to the face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strength of fiction, done well, is that whole stimulation of thought. Creating (or perhaps more accurately, finding) the links for yourself. I believe it truly holds the power to change hearts and minds in a way that a raw recounting of history cannot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than that though, no-one enjoys being preached at, even when they already agree with the message.

I have done the preamble/character introduction bits, but then paused just shy of getting started <em>properly</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead I&#8217;ve caught up on the Overture quest from 2.5, which, come to think of it, is pretty similar in nature to the between-expansion quest lines of FFXIV. Just&#8230; <em>much</em> shorter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; Alright, I&#8217;ve gone on this long. I was going to outline the case for FFXIV before deciding, but perhaps that can just occupy next week&#8217;s slot! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-columns wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65007" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250828220450_2-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Won Augusta 1st night of the patch!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65008" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250830020819_1-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Did <em>not</em> win weapon first night.

I was on a deadline, albeit a self-imposed one. I had things to do. &#8230; Thing to do. <em>Alright, geez,</em> I had a game to play. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have our own motivations, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonight I don&#8217;t have quite the same need.

It takes time. Serious time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments though? Even if they end up being post-length in nature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Easy</em>.

And if you look at it funny and kinda squint a little bit, you might stretch me to two and a quarter. Maybe even two and a half &#8212; as the missing game I <em>had</em> played before, at its PlayStation release. I just thought I might pick it up again on PC, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong> is, frankly, amazing. The gameplay trailers we saw in the four years of development often seemed as if coming directly from a game designer&#8217;s fever dream. Such doubts didn&#8217;t stop me in the slightest from feeling an unhealthy degree of hype for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-medium is-resized wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-58475" height="264" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blackmyth-Wukong-470x264.jpg" style="width: 400px;" width="470" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I knew what I was doing, and it was certainly at the back of my mind that it could <em>never</em>. But it did!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Myth: Wukong ended up being a lot less souls-like and a lot more action-like than I, and I think many others expected, borrowing only lightly from the Souls-like trappings, otherwise content to do its own thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>God of War: Ragnarok</strong> is also amazing.

None of the trailers to date have done much for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, what it was&#8230; Was playing Borderlands 3 again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All I consciously remembered of the game was the eye strain induced by rolling eyes so hard at the antagonist dialogue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually&#8230;?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all that, it was <em>fun</em>. Turns out, there <em>was</em> a reason my friends and I have played through all three Borderlands games to date, sometimes multiple times! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was with that lens some of the gameplay coming out from content creators grabbed my attention a bunch more, and here we are, considering prioritising it against even Hollow Knight: Silksong!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Battlefield 6 &#8212; 11 October</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/other-games/battlefield-6-open-beta/">The beta</a> was enough to convince my friend group that we want in.

What I didn&#8217;t appreciate until quite recently is that it isn&#8217;t just a Singleplayer game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is there co-op, but you can even (optionally) go into a full &#8216;Online&#8217; mode where it is more of an MMO-lite, with world events/bosses, and the whole nine yards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh- it&#8217;s also free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which can be boon or bane; but at least how the devs are talking now &#8212; the monetisation seems restricted to cosmetics only. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a slew of sponsored videos like this one, where there is clearly a desire to build interest in the West before the release later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is coming across as a bit of an &#8216;everything to everyone&#8217; game at the moment, which again&#8230; Could be concerning.

The winner is first to 100 points, where any regular soldier is worth just 1 point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, each side will always have one fighter marked by a beam, indicating they are worth 10.

Because I <em>thought</em> it was a simple DPS race (I was <em>very</em> close to achieving it this way), but I was underestimating the game again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a mechanic there which needed to be respected.

There is a double standard at play there. But this time, one <em>against</em> rather than for myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <em>other</em> people post short posts &#8212; it&#8217;s fine. Maybe even great.

You can find it as you go. But it is important to recognise your motivation <em>is</em> a &#8216;why&#8217;, and not a &#8216;what&#8217;. (Generally.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/staying-motivated/">Staying Motivated</a></strong> &#8212; may involve a degree of change!

Cyberpunk 2077, for all its launch faults, is in fine form now. It wasn&#8217;t abandoned or given bare minimum technical touch-ups. Instead, it had literal <em>years</em> of additional development effort put in to make it sing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bring it up in the context of a brilliant post by <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/">Frostilyte</a>, asking the question: &#8220;<a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/18/is-it-wrong-to-support-grounded-2-in-early-access/">Should <em>Grounded 2</em> even be <em>allowed</em> to utilise <em>Early Access</em>?</a>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My title probably spoils this, but: <em><strong>yes</strong></em>. Not only <em>should</em> Grounded 2 be &#8216;allowed,&#8217; I wish more big titles had the guts to wear the Early Access label when it fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyberpunk sure should have. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, gamers were left feeling anything &#8212; or everything &#8212; from frustration to disappointment, or even betrayal. Slap the EA badge on it and suddenly? The consumer transparency preserves a mountain of goodwill and space to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281" height="461" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190826000049_1-830x461.jpg" width="830" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>No Man&#8217;s Sky</em></strong>: Another example where the &#8216;Early Access&#8217; tag really should&#8217;ve been applied.

Although I would hope not a controversial one: <em>If, for whatever reason, you&#8217;re not going to finish the game before putting it out, maybe at least be honest about this fact.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Frostilyte had more than just us consumers in mind. He was interested in watching out for the Indies, and that&#8217;s where the debate perhaps gets a little more complicated. Early Access was, after all, born as an indie lifeline — a way to keep the lights on and build community while development continued. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It provided a path that maybe <em>didn&#8217;t</em> ask Indies to re-mortgage their house in trade for a year of development time in the hopes of not (literally) losing it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when AAA shows up in that space, the worry is whether it tilts the field even further against the smallest studios. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-53598" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CS2Header-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Cities: Skylines 2:</em></strong> Even now, this one should still be wearing an Early Access badge.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And from that concern, there are a couple of additional paths beyond consumer transparency that my mind goes down, but neither of them changes my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>Indies and AAA <em>already</em> co-exist; and Indies aren&#8217;t just catering to a small niche of interest any more.</strong><br />Indies and AAA&#8217;s already co-exist in the market today, having broadened from a once scrappy niche with only occasional breakouts to something with a higher degree of awareness in the gaming zeitgeist. AAA&#8217;s adopting &#8216;Early Access&#8217; doesn&#8217;t materially change things for the worse, and in fact, there is an argument to be made that says such a move would further legitimise &#8216;Early Access&#8217; and broaden the range of people willing to try it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>What even is an &#8216;Indie&#8217; anyway?</strong><br />The term covers a vast spectrum, from the solo dev mortgaging their house we mentioned, to &#8216;indie elites&#8217; like Supergiant, Team Cherry, or Larian, pulling in millions with sizable teams.

Although this thing has been in the works so long, it certainly has been placed &#8212; for the purposes of retaining sanity &#8212; in my mind into the category of &#8216;never going to turn up in my natural lifespan&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do think a shadow drop at the end of this is not out of the question, but at minimum, I expect we&#8217;ll come away with a release date to go alongside the additional gameplay teaser.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lords of the Fallen II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve only somewhat recently started playing Lords of the Fallen (2023) after their 2.0 update, when they added in co-op by way of a free &#8216;Friends Pass&#8217;, which is a neat addition I always love to see for any game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re not done with it yet, hard to say if we even will (my co-op partner is not much of a Souls-like afficiando), but the experience while not a top-notch-shining-example of the genre was good enough that I&#8217;m holding some interest in seeing where they go next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Europa Universalis V</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not given the Europa Universalis series anywhere near as much time as Crusader Kings, and in fact &#8212; EUIV is the only one I&#8217;ve touched at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is just something about the more personal relationships and stories of CK that pulls it ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so &#8212; colour me interested. Getting in at the ground floor on a Paradox game is generally a good idea if you want to have any hope of learning the game in question without reliance on extensive &#8216;let&#8217;s play&#8217; styled tutorial videos. xD</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Silent Hill <em>f</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230; <em>think</em>&#8230; I&#8217;m interested? I&#8217;ve actually never played a silent hill game before. The concept has always interested me (insofar as I understand it, at least) &#8212; just never made the jump to actually doing anything about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I watched the movie though, if that counts? xD</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, similar to EUV above &#8212; I&#8217;ll await reviews and see how it lands before deciding, but will keep it on my radar in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enshrouded &#8212; Wake of the Water Update</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick search tells me that the only prior mention of Enshrouded on Time to Loot was the <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-january-2024/">January 2024 Journal</a>. Said mention? Just a sole entry logging ~5 hours of play time, and that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll say now what I didn&#8217;t say then: I <em>loved</em> almost everything about my time with Enshrouded, even at that early point (which must&#8217;ve basically been at release).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was just one disappointing factor for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In multiplayer, the quest state is (was? I should look into this) determined by the world state. And not just for things where maybe it makes sense (e.g., rescuing an NPC) but for <em>everything</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you, as I do, prefer to have independent bases *in addition* to the more communal setup&#8211; so far as the quests are concerned anyway, too bad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is absolutely a nitpick, and even if that is unchanged, the look of this update, let alone whatever may have come up to this point, might be the point at which I let it go and jump back in regardless. It looks <em>great</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resident Evil Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My &#8216;real&#8217; introduction to Resident Evil (*cough* outside of the movies) was with what I believe to be the first of the modern entries &#8212; Resident Evil VII: Biohazard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still need to make my way through the frankly amazing-looking remakes at some point, but they may have to wait a bit longer after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Black Myth: Zhong Kui</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yes</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Myth: Wukong, somewhat amazingly, <em>actually managed to live up to the hype.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhong Kui isn&#8217;t just a DLC as earlier speculation suggested, but rather a full-on sequel. I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb and suggest there probably won&#8217;t be as long of a wait this time around, assuming a lot of technology (and perhaps even asset) re-use from Wukong.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vampire: the Masquerade -Bloodlines 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno about this one anymore. It has been through an incredible amount of development hell and studio handovers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might still come out of the oven OK, but I&#8217;d place the chances of that being <em>very</em> slight. Which is a shame, as this occupied the #1 spot on my Steam wishlist for probably a good few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess I might be listing it here now more out of morbid curiosity than anything else. It&#8217;s coming out October 22, 2025 &#8212; so I guess we&#8217;ll know soon enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

There are always various things I want to do, each and every day &#8211; <em>want to</em> being the operative word here, not <em>have to</em>, which makes all the difference to me &#8211; and it still feels like I&#8217;m having a big adventure.</p>\n<p>By now I&#8217;m firmly settled in tier five, which means that I&#8217;ve pretty much explored the whole of Hagga Basin (with only a few bandit outposts missing here and there), fulfilled almost all contracts, and of course crafted a Scout Ornithopter as well as the much bigger Assault variant. I actually had to modify my base&#8217;s hangar quite a bit to make room for the latter, and it still just about fits in there.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8549" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8549 size-full" height="287" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky2.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8549">It dwarfs the buggy parked below, and that thing&#8217;s by no means small</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Just like the buggy before it, getting the first flying vehicle has changed how the game is played substantially. It obviously makes getting to places go much quicker, and even regions <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/23/every-day-on-arrakis-is-an-adventure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as jagged as Hagga Rift</a> have become pretty easy to traverse all of a sudden.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8550" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8550 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8550">No more getting lost down there, ha!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In most other games I&#8217;d probably have perceived this as a downside. In my opinion advanced means of travel often lead to the game world shrinking to the point of not feeling like a <em>world</em> at all anymore. On Arrakis it&#8217;s different somehow.</p>\n<p>First of all, it&#8217;s <em>extremely</em> fun! Turning off the engines and gliding in near silence over and across this beautiful landscapes is a feeling that screenshots can&#8217;t convey &#8211; it has to be experienced.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8551 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky4.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Another important aspect is that the game is very well designed in terms of progression.</p>\n<p>Just as I was realizing how big even the starting area is and how far apart the safe zones are, I got to build a sand bike. Next up the weight and volume of all kinds of stuff kept getting bigger, and harvesting the increasing amounts of required resources by hand got a bit tedious&#8230;buggy to the rescue!</p>\n<p>And now that I can fly everywhere? What do you know, the next tier of resources can only be found far out in the middle of nowhere &#8211; and &#8220;nowhere&#8221; is completely irradiated to boot, so getting in and out quickly is key.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8552" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8552 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8552">I&#8217;m NOT stepping into that sludge, hazmat suit or no!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In other words, everything happens or becomes available at just the right time, which I find pretty amazing.</p>\n<p>The devs took that into account when designing the various contracts, too. In the early game everything is relatively close by, and backtracking is rarely needed. By contrast, the other day I flew no less than four times to Harko Village and back to Hagga Basin because multiple quest lines I was working on required it. Without my own &#8216;thopter this would have been extremely inconvenient &#8211; and expensive, too &#8211; but as these were mid- to late-game contracts it is (correctly) assumed that zipping to and fro isn&#8217;t a problem anymore at that point.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8553" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8553 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky6.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8553">So they <strong>do</strong> have castles and such on Arrakis after all</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Speaking of quests, I&#8217;ve recently finished the first DLC-storyline, and I think it&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s divided into a continuation of the main story, which all players get for free, and a separate, paywalled questline.</p>\n<p>The latter&#8217;s overarching theme is &#8220;Bad AI&#8221;, or at the very least &#8220;Dangerous AI&#8221;, and not only does that fit well into the time we&#8217;re living in, it&#8217;s also a way for the devs to do something very different while not actually deviating from Dune lore.</p>\n<p>The screenshot above shows a game world designed by an AI for its coder and best (and only) friend. I think you can guess what kind of game it&#8217;s supposed to be. I especially appreciate the effort that went into changing even loot containers and such to fit the game&#8217;s aesthetics. It&#8217;s actually quite a sad story, but I liked it.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8554 size-full" height="299" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky7.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Another AI has developed more of a sinister personality, and its hiding place very much reflects that. It&#8217;s basically <em>Dead Space</em> on Arrakis. Really intense, that one!</p>\n<p>Recovering the third AI (which actually comes first when you play through it in order) wasn&#8217;t as memorable, but it&#8217;s still a cool introduction to the theme.</p>\n<p>Each of these quests culminates in a boss battle. Those aren&#8217;t particularly difficult, but I was glad to have <em>The Sentinel</em> equipped (as always), the little floating turret from the Mentat skill tree, because it helped immensely with keeping the swarms of AI-controlled opponents at bay.</p>\n<p>As of yet I haven&#8217;t even built the DLC-exclusive vehicle, the Treadwheel, nor have I used the Duneman building set, but I can highly recommend buying this piece of content for the storyline alone. It&#8217;s of the short variety for sure, but add in the other stuff and I think it&#8217;s well worth the 13 bucks.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8555" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8555 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8555">&#8220;Help me, Mailvaltar, you&#8217;re my only hope!&#8221; Or something.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The new main story quests are pretty cool, too. Among other things I&#8217;ve infiltrated the hideout of a Harkonnen cannibal (seriously), eliminated a cultist leader, and solved a full-blown murder mystery. Like most endeavours in this universe all of this turns out to be quite a bit more ambiguous than it seems at first. Very few things are strictly black or white.</p>\n<p>Also, we get to learn important details about our own origin, which I obviously won&#8217;t spoil here.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8556" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8556 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8556">Oh, look, it&#8217;s the Three Stooges</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I just realized that I&#8217;ve talked about combat encounters quite a lot by now, but I&#8217;ve yet to give my verdict of whether fighting in Dune: Awakening actually feels any good.</p>\n<p>Well&#8230;kinda.</p>\n<p>This <em>is</em> a game made by Funcom, and if you&#8217;ve played <em>The Secret World</em> you know what that means. It&#8217;s&#8230;janky, for lack of a better word. For example, it&#8217;s very easy to get stuck on the tiniest pieces of terrain, which can get you in big trouble when multiple enemies are trying to kill you at the same time.</p>\n<p>Also, you get staggered or stunned all the fricking time, and while that&#8217;s not due to said jankyness but a deliberate design decision (at least I assume that it is) that&#8217;s not really fun, and also <em>very</em> dangerous for obvious reasons.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8557" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8557 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8557">Gross&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Surprisingly though, I enjoy the combat quite a lot despite these shortcomings.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not really difficult in the usual sense of the word, but since it&#8217;s always a bit unpredictable it&#8217;s not exactly easy either. And, as I&#8217;ve talked about in the post linked at the top, there <em>is</em> a death penalty in place, so dying isn&#8217;t something that I want to happen often. Side note: I made a mistake in that post when I said that you drop only Solaris when you die in PvE &#8211; items you&#8217;ve looted like schematics, spice-infused dust etc. drop on death too, and you&#8217;ll usually want that stuff back. In short, there&#8217;s always a bit of tension, but not too much, which is just the way I like it.</p>\n<p>But who knows, maybe I&#8217;ve just grown fond of the Funcom-jankyness during my hundreds of hours playing The Secret World.

I would not have made a good architect, that much is certain.</p>\n<p>I knew that I wanted my next and probably permanent main base to look at least somewhat nice though, so I started to look around and see what other players have done to get some inspiration.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, YouTube turned out to be the best place for that. What <em>did</em> surprise me was that some folks don&#8217;t just show off their great designs, they&#8217;ve even included step by step instructions to recreate them.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8517 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s what I did to get started. Many thanks to Arathy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@crimsonfelisbuilds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crimson Builds</a> for creating this base and taking the time to make that video!</p>\n<p>I still had to get a bit creative though, because, as you can see, the site I&#8217;d chosen to build the base at isn&#8217;t just flat land &#8211; what can I say, I <em>need</em> to have a room with a view &#8211; and the game doesn&#8217;t support terraforming. You <em>can</em> build in, around and even through concrete rock, but there are limits. Also, when there&#8217;s rock or sand inside your base you can&#8217;t place any facilities or furniture on top of it.</p>\n<p>To circumvent losing too much usable space on the ground floor I&#8217;d raised the foundations as much as possible at first &#8211; it seemed to be a good idea at the time. I didn&#8217;t place all of them right away though, as I needed to procure a lot more resources for the full build first. To protect the buggy and myself in the meantime I quickly erected some walls and a roof, and placed some generators, water cisterns and storage containers to collect and refine the building materials on site.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8518 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion3.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Once preparations were completed I tore down the roof and walls again and extended the foundations in all directions to complete the intended footprint &#8211; at least I tried to. Unfortunately the natural ground declines a bit towards the cliffs, and the game didn&#8217;t let me place the last row for lack of support.</p>\n<p>Adjacent foundations have to be built at the same height, so I had no other choice than to tear them all down and start over. However, there was lots of stuff lying around by now. Grrrr!</p>\n<p>What happened next was basically a game of Tetris. Move all facilities to one side, tear some foundations down, build new ones on a lower level, push everything onto those, destroy the rest&#8230;all while trying not to get a sunburn and hoping for the next sandstorm to take its sweet time.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8519" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8519 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8519">I&#8217;ve got the power! Still not enough though&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It all worked out in the end, and once the foundations were in place finishing the build wasn&#8217;t much of a problem.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using this base for about ten days since then, and I&#8217;m really digging it. Also, <em>now</em> I&#8217;m much more in my element again, namely taking something that&#8217;s already there and refining it to my liking. I add, remove or memodel bits and pieces all the time, and I&#8217;ll continue to do so until I&#8217;m completely satisfied.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;generator wing&#8221; seen above, for example, was a thorn in my side right from the start. Then I remembered that those things basically don&#8217;t have to be touched anymore once they&#8217;re up and running, so I built another floor on top of them and covered the gap with some stairs. Now it&#8217;s as if that part of the house doesn&#8217;t exist, and I&#8217;ve gained an elevated relaxation- or conference-area that I didn&#8217;t have room for before.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8520" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8520 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8520">The pillar I&#8217;m standing on usually isn&#8217;t there of course</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I have few points of comparison, but I think the building system is really robust and fairly easy to use. Most of the time things snap together just as I&#8217;d like them to right away, and if they don&#8217;t I usually only need to rotate them or reposition myself a bit.</p>\n<p>Gathering the needed materials takes a while, but with a buggy it&#8217;s pretty easy. You can buy more and more different furniture- as well as building-sets over time, too. I just wish those schematics would state the required resources. I was a bit irritated at first when I realized that I needed &#8220;plastone&#8221; to actually use the Atreides set I&#8217;d just spent 80k Solaris on, which I didn&#8217;t have nor knew how or where to get at the time.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8537" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion6-1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8537 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion6-1.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8537">Another raised floor houses a little biker workshop</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Minor gripes aside though, this is one more aspect of the game that I&#8217;m overall very happy with.</p>\n<p>By the way, if you think this base looks good or even great, you ain&#8217;t seen nothing yet. Funcom held a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/build-your-dune-winners/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">building contest</a> a while ago, and many of the entries, even the ones that didn&#8217;t win, are absolutely awesome.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/buildyourdune1_1080.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8525 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/buildyourdune1_1080.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>This one is my favourite.

No, what&#8217;s really extraordinary is that each and every one of those hours felt exciting and full of discovery and adventure. I&#8217;m not exaggerating.</p>\n<p>If all survival games are like this I totally understand now why they are so popular.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8480" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8480 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures2.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8480">What exactly have you guys been doing here again&#8230;?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But what makes the game feel so different from basically anything else I&#8217;ve played? Well, there are quite a few contributing factors.</p>\n<p>First of all, there is actual danger. Heat, storms, radiation, fricking high rock formations and deep chasms, quicksand, overall pretty tough enemies and, of course, sandworms. On Arrakis absolutely everything is trying to kill you.</p>\n<p>Now, except for when <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/15/the-desert-giveth-shai-hulud-taketh-away/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">being swallowed by a worm</a> the penalty for dying usually isn&#8217;t all that harsh. You drop any Solari you had on you, and if you didn&#8217;t place a respawn beacon nearby you may find yourself quite a ways away from where you were. You can still go back and reclaim your cash though, so all you&#8217;ll lose is some time. And water. And probably some durability on your vehicle of choice.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8481" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8481 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8481">Oh, you&#8217;ve got to be kidding me</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Dying&#8217;s not the end of the world, is what I&#8217;m saying, but you&#8217;d still prefer it didn&#8217;t happen. Which is why I always try to be cautious and alert, and I&#8217;ve died only three times total thus far as a result.</p>\n<p>For me this really hits kind of a sweet spot. Death penalties suck ass in games where you inevitably die very often, possibly even without you having any chance to prevent it &#8211; think an MMORPG dungeon group wiping repeatedly because others aren&#8217;t doing their jobs.</p>\n<p>However, when dying is of absolutely no consequence there can be no sense of danger. So penalizing death, but not too severely, <em>and</em> giving me the agency to prevent it from ever happening (at least theoretically) is the optimal way to do it in my opinion, as it causes just the right amount of tension.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8482" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8482 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8482">I cranked up the brightness by a lot already, believe it or not</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As I said earlier, human beings and gigantic worms aren&#8217;t the only dangerous things on Arrakis. The area pictured on the two screenshots above is called Hagga Rift, and I&#8217;ve never seen, much less traversed, a more jagged and fascinating, yet also disorienting and treacherous landscape in a game before.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine getting around on foot or bike isn&#8217;t an easy feat here, and I got very confused during my first forays into the area. That it gets really dark the closer to the canyon&#8217;s bottom you get doesn&#8217;t help one bit.</p>\n<p>Even when I slowly started to know my way around the environment kept throwing curveballs at me. Like when I fell through a hole in the floor while looting a shipwreck (did I mention that it&#8217;s fricking dark down there?), only that said hole didn&#8217;t lead to where I thought it would &#8211; as it turned out I&#8217;d already been on the ship&#8217;s lowest deck, and I now found myself in a free fall all the way down into the canyon.

Just the other day I ventured into another hitherto undiscovered region, and this one looks and feels completely different yet again (shown above). Reminds me a bit of Arizona, to be honest.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the landscape either, the enemies and their bases also have their very own aesthetics.

Well, there it is.</p>\n<p>Having a buggy really changes the game quite significantly. For one, its cutteray sucks so much more material out of resource nodes than the handheld version that it&#8217;s not even funny. Naturally it can also carry a crapton of stuff to go along with that, which is not only great for gathering, but also for moving shit around between bases &#8211; or for moving bases altogether.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8487" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8487 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8487">Leaving my Borg Cube behind for good&#8230;more about my new base next time</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At this stage of the game these features aren&#8217;t just nice to have though, they pretty much become a necessity. Building things like better refineries, bigger water cisterns and so on requires more and more resources, and as a consequence your base keeps growing not only in size, but also in terms of how much stuff you have crammed into it.</p>\n<p>Which is another thing that Dune: Awakening does very well in my opinion: progression.</p>\n<p>It all feels very natural to me, and it&#8217;s paced just right. Moving through the resource tiers happens more or less on autopilot thus far, and I feel neither forced to rush anything, nor held back in any way. It&#8217;s also very satisfying to progress to the next tier because of little details like, for instance, the bigger ore refinery not only allowing you to process new types of materials, but also being more efficient when refining the &#8220;old&#8221; tiers.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8488" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8488 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8488">These things keep getting bigger and bigger though</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I really like how the skill trees open up more and more over time, too. Many abilities and passives have three ranks, but when you first gain access to a new class you can only spend points on the first rank of each. Working for the advanced trainers (most of which are found in either Arakeen or Harko Village) unlocks the second and third ranks as well as the special Spice-skills over the course of several quests.</p>\n<p>Since basically everything you do in the game rewards XP you keep levelling up all the time (I&#8217;m currently at level 129), and as each ding grants one additional skill point they tend to pile up. Thus, whenever I&#8217;ve increased the rank of a skill tree or unlocked a new one, I&#8217;ve always had just about the right amount of available skill points to pick or level up the ones that seemed useful to me.</p>\n<p>One thing that&#8217;s severely lacking, though, is having skill loadouts or something like that. It&#8217;s really tedious to swap around skills one by one, and since we can choose only three at a time (until you&#8217;ve reached a certain point in the main story it&#8217;s actually only <em>two</em>) not switching at all isn&#8217;t an option. Please, Funcom, do it! Give it a cooldown of a minute or two, I don&#8217;t care, but we really need this.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures11.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8489 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures11.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>And that shall be enough for today.

And, to be quite honest, I&#8217;d become a bit too comfy and carefree by then, so instead of hugging the rocky areas as much as possible I took a pretty long route across open sand. I thought that I&#8217;d be okay as long as I stayed clear of drum sand.</p>\n<p>I was mistaken. When the aggro meter turned red while I was still a couple hundred meters away from safety I knew I was in trouble. Luckily I had a booster equipped to the sandbike (the alternatives being a cargo crate or passenger seat), and I saved that for the moment you see on the picture above so as to not overheat it too early.</p>\n<p>How close of a call was it? Well&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8441" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8441 size-full" height="303" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8441">When the red squiggly line seen below me looks like this, GTFO!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The moment I hit the screenshot key I thought I was done for.

Phew (once again)!</p>\n<p>However, just a day later I wasn&#8217;t so lucky.</p>\n<p>At that point various contracts were asking me to venture further north, and to do so one has to traverse the first instances of quicksand. While moving on drum sand &#8220;only&#8221; increases worm aggro, quicksand is (as far as I know) a death trap for players and vehicles alike.

In the bigger camps and dungeons they&#8217;re usually located in or past the boss room, or all the way at the top in the more vertical ones, and basically can&#8217;t be missed.

I have, for example, farmed one specific chest for days on end, because I wanted to get my hands on the unique rifle that only drops there. Said rifle is just one of three schematics on that chest&#8217;s table though, and I got the (also useful) sandbike engine once, and the scattergun (which I didn&#8217;t want at all) <em>six fricking times</em> before the rifle finally made an appearance.</p>\n<p>I have even logged off there to do something else for a while, then logged back in just to loot the chest again.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8446" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8446 size-full" height="315" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8446">Sometimes they&#8217;re smaller for some reason</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Despite the RNG repeatedly being a dick I quite enjoy this whole part of the gameplay loop though.

It also incentivises going back to places you&#8217;ve already been &#8211; which you most likely would have to anyway for crafting mats and the like &#8211; so you don&#8217;t burn through each area quite as fast.</p>\n<p>Which, for me, is a good thing.

This way the guys with melee weapons will sprint after you first, and you can hopefully dispatch them with your own knife or sword before their homies catch up.</p>\n<p>I also made generous use of grenades and turrets, and generally kept kiting and using cover as much as I could.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8407" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8407 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8407">Some of these shots were actually taken someplace else&#8230;I had more pressing things to do than sightseeing!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I was so tense and focused the whole time that I didn&#8217;t pay attention to how long I was at it already, but after a while it dawned on me&#8230;this thing just kept going, and going, and going still.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for me you can&#8217;t really get lost down there (I hate mazes with a passion). Sometimes a path branches off, but one of the two options always leads to a dead end soon, so there&#8217;s effectively only one way you can go. At least that wasn&#8217;t a concern.</p>\n<p>But what if I&#8217;d died? I&#8217;m not sure how quickly enemies respawn, but it&#8217;s seemingly something like 10-15 minutes. Which means that I would have had to fight my way down here again all the way from the top.</p>\n<p>Then I remembered that one of the things you can craft on the fly, provided you have the resources on hand, is a placeable respawn beacon. By then I had looted enough scrap metal to make a couple, so I plopped one down right away, just to be safe.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8408" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8408 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon6.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8408">How big <strong>is</strong> this place?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Deeper and deeper I went, with no end in sight. Aside from loot chests and enemies &#8211; of whom I&#8217;d probably dispatched nearly fifty by now &#8211; I found various audio recordings providing the place&#8217;s backstory. Don&#8217;t ask me about that though, for I was much too focused on the path ahead of me to actually listen.</p>\n<p>To make things even more tense my supply of ammo and bandages had started to noticably wane by now. You find that stuff left and right, but I was consuming even more than I got. About time to finish this, I thought.</p>\n<p>Then I <em>finally</em> came to a door with a green energy barrier, which I assumed had to lead into the boss room.</p>\n<p>You see, such barriers are usually red at first, unless you have already found the corresponding &#8216;identification band&#8217;. I hadn&#8217;t picked up any kind of key during my whole run, so why was this one green? Ah, but I&#8217;d seen this before, in Testing Station No. 2! As soon as I&#8217;d walked through the door there it turned red and wouldn&#8217;t let me get out until the boss was dead.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8409" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8409 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon7.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8409">Looks so inviting&#8230;should say &#8220;DANGER AHEAD&#8221; instead!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I placed a new respawn beacon right in front of the door, checked my weapons and bandages one last time, and went in.</p>\n<p>I found myself in a large, two-story hangar of sorts, and immediately had to fight for my life. I used the same tactics as before and dispatched the first batch of enemies, then another one. While doing so I noticed someone shooting at me from quite a distance&#8230;sniper! I tried to always have something between us while fighting the others, but still got hit once, and all of a sudden I was poisoned.</p>\n<p>I started losing health fast while still fighting some other guy. Luckily I managed to finish him off quickly and applied a bandage right away. I don&#8217;t know if that stopped the poison or if it had just worn off by then, but my health bar turned from green to red again and I could heal up to full normally. Phew.</p>\n<p>Using every bit of cover I could find I then got near enough for the sniper to switch to a different weapon, but I just made short work of him with my knife.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8410" style="width: 1208px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8410 size-full" height="771" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon8.jpg" width="1208" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8410">The slow blade penetrates the shield!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I had assumed the sniper to be the boss, but apparently not. By now the contract had updated its objective to &#8220;Kill Inna Hiller&#8221;, and that wasn&#8217;t checked off yet.</p>\n<p>The hangar&#8217;s upper level was clear now, but the doors (plural because there&#8217;s one at both ends) were still red, so I went downstairs &#8211; only to get instantly perforated by a heavy gunner. Seriously, I went from full shields and health to dead in like three seconds, tops. Guess I&#8217;d found the boss, eh?</p>\n<p>I respawned on my beacon and went in again. I had learned by now that Holtzman shields are turned off whenever the wearer fires a ranged weapon, but considering how quickly I&#8217;d died I wanted her not to shoot <em>me</em> of course. So I tried to get her to start firing, only to immediately take cover and let my grenades and turret do the work, which, after a while, did the trick. Phew again. But what&#8217;s that? This wasn&#8217;t Inna Hiller either?!?</p>\n<p>At least the doors were green now, so on to the next room. This one was much smaller, but also with some opportunities to take cover. To my relief these four enemies didn&#8217;t pose much of a problem, and now the contract was finally completed. Phew the third.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8411" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8411 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8411">Loot on the right, ID band on the left (the tiny purple ring)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I looted the super chest (more about those another time), and to my extreme delight the key that lay right next to it indeed led to a shortcut back to the surface, just as I&#8217;d hoped the whole time. This, too, seems to be a standard feature of these stations, and I think it&#8217;s great design.</p>\n<p>And so my first proper dungeon run in Dune: Awakening had come to a victorious close.</p>\n<p>To tell you the truth, I&#8217;m absolutely sure that I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten anywhere near the boss fight(s), let alone beat those, without the aforementioned grenades. These aren&#8217;t consumables that you buy or craft and then equip like in most games, but come from the Trooper skill <em>Explosive Grenade</em>. If you play the game and haven&#8217;t already, I highly suggest to unlock that and give it a try. It&#8217;s <em>so</em> helpful! If you have a Technique-slot to spare also use <em>Battle Hardened</em> to reduce its cooldown a little (as well as that of all other Trooper skills, including the grappling hook).</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8412" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8412 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8412">My work is done!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m not exaggerating when I say that it&#8217;s been a very, <em>very</em> long time since I had a solo PvE experience as gripping as this one.</p>\n<p>Now, do I want every session to be like this? Hell no! Those one and a half hours (or however long it actually was) left me completely exhausted. But I was also exhilarated, and so very pleased with myself at the end! Games that can make me feel like that are a rare breed these days, so hats off to you, Funcom!</p>\n<p>Oh, and as if all of this hadn&#8217;t been enough excitement for a day I came <em>this</em> close to getting swallowed by a sandworm while collecting screenshots for this post.

In the case of Valheim, fellow bloggers like <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/search/label/Valheim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bhagpuss</a> and <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/category/valheim/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wilhelm</a> made it sound quite fun, too.</p>\n<p>I, however, played none of them despite all the praise they got. The very idea of having to take care of a character who needs to eat and drink, who can be too hot or too cold, and/or who also needs shelter lest the faintest of breezes kills him within seconds, just sounded like the antithesis of fun to me. I’m pretty sure that I actually tried a game with similar mechanics a long time ago…I can’t for the life of me remember what it was, but my vague memories of it aren’t fond either way.</p>\n<p>The thing is though, these games usually <em>do</em> have a whole bunch of features and characteristics that very much appeal to me, namely exploration, resource gathering, crafting and, above all, base building. Which is why, despite said dislike of survival mechanics, I’ve always eyed them curiously from the sidelines.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8370 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Hence when I started to read really good things about <em>Dune: Awakening</em>, for example over at <a href="https://chasingdings.com/category/mmos/dune-awakening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chasing Dings!</a>, <a href="https://www.heartlessgamer.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heartless Gamer</a> and <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Friendly Necromancer</a>, an ever growing desire to try it out took hold of me. Next thing I know is that I’m watching various videos about the game on YouTube, and once I see what players are capable of doing with its base building system I can’t resist any longer.</p>\n<p>Thus I finally decided to harden up and add some spice to my gaming diet &#8211; literally.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that I’ve only played about fifteen hours up to now, so these are going to be impressions of just the early game. To give you the bottom line up front though: I&#8217;m really digging it so far.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8371 size-full" height="278" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with why I chose this game over the others.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m not the biggest Dune fan ever &#8211; I&#8217;ve actually yet to read the novels &#8211; I quite like the first movie as well as the new ones. In terms of aesthetics and vibe the Denis Villeneuve films really are something else, and the game is very much based on those. The story takes place in an alternate timeline, but one that&#8217;s pretty interesting.</p>\n<p>Specific IP aside, I&#8217;ll take a futuristic, or shall we say &#8216;technologically advanced&#8217; setting over fantasy, dark ages or some such any day of the week.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the game looks freaking awesome. I&#8217;m by no means a graphics-snob, but here the high level of detail and realism really help to get the feel from the movies across.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8372 size-full" height="298" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read my ramblings about <i>ArcheAge</i> or <i>The Secret World</i> you know that I love me a flexible skill system. Not only does Dune: Awakening have that, you can actually unlock <i>all</i> classes on one character.</p>\n<p>You accumulate a crapton of skillpoints over time, too. I assume that it won&#8217;t be enough to unlock absolutely everything, but it seems that you&#8217;ll at the very least be able to create the combat build of your choice while also having all traversal skills as well as the various passives to gather more resources, consume less durability and so on active at the same time.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t like your build anymore or find that you&#8217;ve missed something important, fret not. Respeccing the whole thing can be done every 48 hours and doesn&#8217;t cost a thing.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8373 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Speaking of traversal, holy macaroni, the game is really fun in this regard, even before you&#8217;ve built any of the awesome vehicles.</p>\n<p>Spread across the classes you can unlock a grappling hook, an extremely fast sprint and an anti-gravity-bubble, and there’s also an equippable hover-device to either craft or loot. While these are already great on their own their real strenght comes into play when combined. For example, use the hook to propel yourself up a cliff, then press Space in mid-air to hover, and your momentum will carry you much higher or further.</p>\n<p>Getting up and down the game&#8217;s mountains, some of which being actually pretty high (and falling damage is a thing of course), becomes quite easy once you get the hang of it. And also, like I said, a lot of fun.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8374 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>As of yet I&#8217;ve only managed to build the smallest of the vehicles, the sandbike seen above. Even with only tier one parts it’s already much faster than running, and since the game world is anything but small owning one speeds up resource gathering trips or bandit base raids considerably. To no-one’s surprise it&#8217;s also a hoot to drive.</p>\n<p>My next goal is the sand buggy. The name is a bit misleading I feel, because it&#8217;s actually more like a hauler with lots of carrying capacity and built-in mining laser. A gatherer&#8217;s wet dream, in other words.</p>\n<p>The Ornithopters, of which there are three variants, should be the most fun of course, but those will probably take me a good while to get.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8375 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Resource acquisition comes in various flavors.</p>\n<p>Whenever you&#8217;re in an area where specific stuff can be found, some of it just lies on the ground here and there, waiting to be picked up. The amounts you get that way are pretty negligible though, even early on.</p>\n<p>What you&#8217;re really after is resource nodes. Those usually look like a big rock, clump or stack made out of the material in question. Scan these nodes with your mining tool and then cut along the blue line that appears to break them and get a good chunk of the stuff.</p>\n<p>Once you’re able to build a dew scythe you can collect water from plants, but early on most of this precious resource will come from siphoning off dead opponents’ blood and purifying it. The next step up the ladder will be to dissolve whole corpses in some kind of high-tech sarcophagus (I kid you not).</p>\n<p>Collecting Spice has again its own mechanics, but I&#8217;ll talk about that when I&#8217;ve experienced it myself.</p>\n<p>Overall I like how resource acquisition works in this game quite a lot. Since looting dead enemies and their bases, shipwrecks and research stations is yet another way to get your hands on valuable stuff there&#8217;s much variety here, so things shouldn&#8217;t get boring too quickly.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8376 size-full" height="293" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>This is my first base, and it&#8217;s obviously crap. I hastily slapped the first iteration of it down while the sun was scorching me, and instead of starting over from scratch at night I just kept adding to it whenever I needed more space. I didn&#8217;t know yet that <em>all</em> of the resources are refunded when you tear something down again, which is really great as it incentivises trying stuff out and also takes the sting out of relocating.</p>\n<p>Which will probably happen a couple of times, so this one is temporary anyway. I&#8217;ll design something better &#8211; hopefully much better &#8211; for my main base, once I know where I actually want to build that.</p>\n<p>Provided I’ll find an open spot there, that is &#8211; this <i>is</i> open world housing after all. It seems to me that there&#8217;s lots of space to go around though, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, the building system itself is pretty spiffy and, like I said, some folks have done ridiculously cool stuff with it already.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8377 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So what about the survival mechanics then?</p>\n<p>To my surprise I&#8217;m totally fine with them. I would actually go as far as saying that I prefer them being in the game just the way they are, instead of having none at all. Why? Because they add a little bit of tension and thus a sense of danger and adventure, while in reality not being <i>that</i> dangerous after all.</p>\n<p>You see, there is no hunger, so all you need is water, and that&#8217;s not really much of a problem right from the start. Sure, you can&#8217;t outright ignore it, but the game doesn&#8217;t make it overly hard for you to stay alive.</p>\n<p>Freezing at night ain&#8217;t a thing, but sunstroke sure is. To avoid that you only need to find yourself a bit of shadow though, so that&#8217;s usually not a big problem. Even if you do overheat, all that happens is that your hydration wanes much faster, and, again, you quite quickly get to a point where water reserves become more or less a non-issue (for your body at least; it seems that higher tier crafting will require tons of it, too).</p>\n<p>Aside from that there&#8217;s sandstorms and, of course, Shai-Hulud, aka sandworms. I don’t know yet how that might change later on, but in the starting area avoiding both is a concern, but not hard to do at all.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressionsx.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8378 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressionsx.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So, yeah, all things considered I really like what this game has to offer so far, and I haven’t even talked about crafting or combat yet as this is already getting long as it is.</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">To me Dune: Awakening is more than the sum of its parts anyway.

The way he switches from Marc Spector to Steven Grant or vice versa in a heartbeat, completely changing his accent and speech melody, as well as his whole demeanor and body language, is nothing short of amazing. Sometimes you can see the transition in his eyes alone! I liked him as an actor before, but this performance easily made him one of my favourites.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;m a big fan of ancient egyptian mythology, Moon Knight&#8217;s adventures also get bonus points from me for their themes and setting. In any case, I can strongly recommend watching the show if you haven&#8217;t yet.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8307" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8307 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight1.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8307">&#8220;Oh, the idiot&#8217;s in control&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;I heard that!&#8221; *angrily shakes his fist*</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So what about the ARPG&#8217;s take on Khonshu&#8217;s avatar?</p>\n<p>I think he&#8217;s really fun. Unlike some other heroes he isn&#8217;t more or less locked into either melee or ranged combat, as he&#8217;s got various abilities of both flavors at his disposal. He can even morph some of them into one or the other via his talents and traits, which are unlocked from level 32 onward.</p>\n<p>When fighting up close he uses weapons like truncheons, nunchucks and a bo staff, while depending on his signature crescent blades for ranged combat. Strangely, some skills have him shoot those blades out of a pair of pistols. I don&#8217;t know how that&#8217;s supposed to work, but I assume that it&#8217;s canon.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8308" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8308 size-full" height="308" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight2.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8308">&#8220;Did he just throw the gun??&#8221; Well, not exactly&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>His unique resource is called <em>Khonshu&#8217;s Favor</em>. It starts out empty, and some abilities build it up over time. Once at 100% he can use either of two spenders (or both at the same time if specced for it), which completely depletes all favor and gives him big buffs for quite a while.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s great about this is that most of his skills need no resources whatsoever, so you can basically use everything off cooldown, and spam those that don&#8217;t have one endlessly.</p>\n<p>His signature ability is a barrage of very quick attacks with a big finisher at the end. This one, too, can be switched between melee and ranged, and while the former does more damage I prefer the latter as it&#8217;s much easier (and also safer) to use. You can &#8220;weave&#8221; it around a bit if you&#8217;re quick, but in essence it&#8217;s a single-target skill, which is quite unusual for a signature. The upside is that it literally melts bosses&#8230;well, not <em>literally</em>, but&#8230;you know what I mean&#8230;and that&#8217;s a trade-off I&#8217;m very willing to make.</p>\n<p>His Ultimate, however, is by no means lacking in room clearing capability, as it peppers a pretty large area with gunfire and rockets for 20 seconds straight. You can still move and attack with your other skills in the meantime, too. Great stuff.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8309" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8309 size-full" height="315" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8309">Call in the Batwing&#8230;err&#8230;I mean, the &#8220;Moon Copter&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I gotta say, I really appreciate how unique every hero I&#8217;ve tried up to now plays and feels. I believe they doubled down on this when they released the BUE (Biggest Update Ever) in January &#8217;17, and while that patch was met with a ton of criticism by the playerbase as well, I think they did a good job in this regard at the very least.</p>\n<p>I also really like how much control I have over each character&#8217;s specific playstyle. The aforementioned traits &#8211; it&#8217;s basically a talent tree that lets you choose one out of three options every few levels &#8211; offer more substantial alterations to a hero&#8217;s kit than most games do. Said switching between melee and ranged capabilities, or giving an attack a huge damage boost and additional DoT in exchange for a longer cooldown are just a few examples.</p>\n<p>Granted, I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface so far, what with 58 more heroes waiting to be played. But, again, the ones I have given a shot are really unique and fun, and Moon Knight is no exception.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8310" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8310 size-full" height="355" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8310">&#8220;What are we wearing??&#8221; &#8220;She said I needed a suit.&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, the ceremonial armor from Khonshu&#8217;s temple, not psycho Colonel Sanders!&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Basically the only thing that he&#8217;s lacking is a high-quality costume based on his signature armor from the show &#8211; which is no surprise of course, as the game was shut down five years before that even came out. Fortunately the one I&#8217;m wearing on all screenshots seen in this post, based on Steven Grant&#8217;s version of MK (known as &#8220;Mr. Knight&#8221;, I believe), comes pretty close to the one Oscar Isaac wears when Steven&#8217;s in charge, so that&#8217;s at least something.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s enough for today.

I&#8217;m pedantic, but not <em>that</em> pedantic.</p>\n<p>But still, in my opinion rewards you only get if you do something, even if it&#8217;s just logging in, <em>aren&#8217;t</em> free.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8278" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz20.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8278 size-full" height="289" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz20.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8278">It&#8217;s lying! Even the top row isn&#8217;t &#8220;free&#8221;, it just doesn&#8217;t cost any real money</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The idea for this post came to me when I recently watched someone review other players&#8217; <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> accounts (yep, that&#8217;s a thing in gacha game circles). Several times during the video the host says that this character or that weapon should totally be leveled up to the maximum because &#8220;it&#8217;s a free power upgrade&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve played any gacha game before I don&#8217;t need to tell you this, but in case you haven&#8217;t: the resources to level stuff up are far from being free!</p>\n<p>Now, I know what they <em>mean</em> by saying that. To farm for things in this type of game you need stamina (in ZZZ it&#8217;s called battery charge), which replenishes on its own over time. So, <em>technically speaking</em>, given enough time you have a virtually unlimited amount at your disposal, which of course cannot be said about gacha currency, hence the distinction.</p>\n<p>However, in reality there&#8217;s quite a bunch of caveats to calling those upgrade mats &#8220;free&#8221;.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8279" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8279 size-full" height="270" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8279">I sure as hell didn&#8217;t get all this just because I&#8217;m such a nice guy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For one, your stamina pool always has a cap. Usually it&#8217;s 24 hours worth of recharge, sometimes even less, which means that you have to spend it very regularly in order to use as much as the game is willing to hand out to you.</p>\n<p>More importantly though, to spend stamina you actually have to, you know, <em>do stuff</em>. I mean, that goes without saying, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>Now, granted, in ZZZ I can burn six hours&#8217; worth of battery in about ten seconds if I&#8217;m in a hurry (or actually need and want just the most basic of materials), but even that can become a chore if done each and every day. Hell, spending my stamina in <em>Genshin Impact</em> became such a burden after a while that I had to <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2021/08/24/oh-boy-here-we-go-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quit playing altogether</a> for a long time. But to my point, even if stuff like this <em>does</em> only take a couple of minutes each day &#8211; that&#8217;s still not fricking <em>free</em>!</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8280" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8280 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8280">Even adopting a cute cat was <strong>a lot</strong> of work, believe you me</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But what about rewards I get just for logging in &#8211; those are surely freebies, aren&#8217;t they?</p>\n<p>Well, here&#8217;s the thing. The idea behind all of this, whether it&#8217;s &#8220;only&#8221; farming a bunch of stages for a couple of minutes or even &#8220;just&#8221; logging in, is that at least <em>some</em> players will not immediately log out again. <em>Since I&#8217;m already here</em>, they might say to themselves, <em>maybe I&#8217;ll also take a quick peek at the new event</em>, or whatever. And before they know it they&#8217;ve spent an hour or more in the game. And <em>time</em>, seemingly contrary to some people&#8217;s opinion, is neither free nor without value.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the incentive to log in can be so big that it might lead to stuff happening that you didn&#8217;t actually want to happen at all. Here&#8217;s an example. A couple of weeks ago an email informed me about ZZZ celebrating its first anniversary by gifting everyone an S-rank character and weapon of their choosing from the standard pool.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to play that game anymore (I even <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/06/06/eight-years-of-blogging-about-mostly-old-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said so</a> not too long ago), but this? Well, guess what&#8230;I re-installed and patched up the ~70 GB client, claimed the &#8220;free&#8221; stuff and then thought to myself, well, now I kinda want to try them out, and let&#8217;s have a look at what&#8217;s new in the game, too, and&#8230;sure enough I went and played the game for many hours over the following couple of weeks.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8281" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281 size-full" height="283" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8281">They sure know how to tug those heartstrings</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As long as I&#8217;m having fun that&#8217;s not actually a bad thing though, is it?</p>\n<p>Not really, no. Playing the story chapters I&#8217;d missed, visiting new areas and doing some events really <em>was</em> quite fun. However, considering that I&#8217;d much rather play <em>Marvel Heroes</em> right now, the fact that they&#8217;ve managed to pull me back in, and that I now feel almost obligated &#8211; again &#8211; to at least log in and spend some battery every day (and tend to my video store, and hang out with my agents, and&#8230;see what I mean?) does bug me quite a bit.</p>\n<p>And, yeah, that&#8217;s completely on me, I do realize that. Nobody <em>forces</em> me to do anything. I know for a fact that I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s susceptible to these practices though &#8211; which is exactly why they exist in the first place of course. That&#8217;s why we should stop pretending (or actually believing) that it&#8217;s all completely harmless, and that game developers give so much stuff away solely out of the kindness of their hearts.</p>\n<p>That all being said, I&#8217;m not here to tell you that you shouldn&#8217;t enjoy collecting login rewards, spending your stamina or whatever. If those things make you happy and don&#8217;t lure you into spending your time on gameplay you don&#8217;t actually fancy doing, more power to you.</p>\n<p>But please, let&#8217;s stop calling stuff <em>free</em> when it actually isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Blaugust 2025 post count: 3</span></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/08/11/most-free-stuff-actually-isnt/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/437dcc44b8a84b55b593db055be0b2ad5e4f7270a3a8d9b83303bcaa0310d98d?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/blaugust2025-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz20.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

For example, I still quite enjoy <em>Punisher: War Zone</em> (rest in peace, Ray Stevenson), and just the other day I had an absolute blast with 2018&#8217;s <em>Venom</em> once again.</p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;d just hit level cap with the Punisher in <em>Marvel Heroes</em> I thought, well, what better time to give everyone&#8217;s favourite symbiote a spin. Boy, what a great decision that was.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8249" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8249 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8249">WE are Venom!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Like many heroes (or villains&#8230;depending on who you ask, I guess) he has his own mechanics and special resource to go along with it. Actually he has <em>two</em> resources to manage, because some of his abilities consume his own hitpoints, and also deal more damage the less he has left. To make permanently running around on low health feasible he&#8217;s a pretty tanky dude, and I&#8217;m looking forward to how this feels at higher levels.</p>\n<p>His unique resource is called <em>Ichor</em>, and it looks the part. Yuck. Thankfully it starts at full when you enter a level, unlike, say, Scarlet Witch&#8217;s <em>Chaos Energy</em>, which has to be built up first (I don&#8217;t know her full kit though, so take this with a grain of salt).</p>\n<p>Consequently you can go all-in right from the start, spending Ichor as well as hitpoints galore. As long as you weave in abilities that recharge at least one or the other, depending on what you need, you should be good.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8250" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8250 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8250">Have a nice life</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Most importantly, it plays well, and also looks and feels really great. It&#8217;s hard to get good screenshots of it, because his powers move so damn fast and twitchy (as they should), but I hope it comes across at least somewhat on the ones I&#8217;m showing here.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8251" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8251 size-full" height="330" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8251">So many snacks, so little time</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Having played a new (to me) hero for a couple of hours now has also highlighted some more aspects of the game where the developers went the extra mile to make each of them unique and fun.</p>\n<p>For example, every character has a basic movement ability right from the start. It&#8217;s basically a short dash, meant to get out of harm&#8217;s way quickly. The Punisher does a forward roll, Captain America lunges with his shield held in front of him, Venom shoots a tendril of ichor and then pulls himself after it. Some are too lazy to move on their own and just teleport.</p>\n<p>It gets really crazy at level 10 though, when everyone gets their &#8220;travel power&#8221;. These aren&#8217;t for combat (they even have a short cast-time), but they&#8217;re a godsend for traversing the huge maps quickly. And I mean <em>quickly</em>. I really wish every ARPG had something like this, because not only takes it the sting out of any backtracking you might have to do, it&#8217;s also <em>fun as hell</em>!</p>\n<p>Cap and the Punisher just sprint really fast, Blade, Wolverine and Ghost Rider&#8230;well, ride their motorbikes, while Iron Man, Wanda and others fricking <em>fly</em> (Ant-Man rides a flying ant of course)! It&#8217;s not just for show either. While they can&#8217;t go over higher obstacles like freight containers or buildings, getting to another floor level or from rooftop to rooftop without taking the stairs or bridges is no problem. And as for Venom, well&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8252" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8252 size-full" height="310" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8252">Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Holy macarony, how awesome is <em>that</em>? I assume Spidey and Carnage do something similar. Mechanically it&#8217;s the same as flying, so bonus points for that.</p>\n<p>Of course each hero also has their own lore-appropriate ultimate ability.\xa0 Iron Man activates the <em>House Party Protocol</em>, the Punisher calls in an armored and armed-to-the-teeth van that would make B.A. Baracus blush, and Cap&#8230;take a guess&#8230;<em>AVENGERS ASSEMBLE</em>!</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re really powerful, too.

In reality, it\'s home to designers, singers, choreographers, photographers, business owners, and a strong mix of diverse roleplay experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/39847fe2-9b7f-4421-ab87-bf8ed4e0b04f/Off+to+Italy+Shi.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">One of those roleplay communities is focused on Greek Life found on HBCU campuses. I am a proud member and one of the founders of one such organization, Alpha Omega Mu. Founded in 2007, AΩM has been a passion of mine off and on throughout the years. AΩM has deep roots in honoring the Divine Nine, a collection of African American sororities and fraternities that started in the United States in the 1800s, and our focus on charity is a core part of who we are. For 18 years, we have raised funds for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and have also contributed to other organizations’ charity drives. Since returning to Second Life three years ago, I’ve spent much of my time focused on growing a strong and thriving sisterhood. This year has come with growing pains, but we’ve shifted our focus and are aiming to put roleplay at the forefront of our organization.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">There is a thriving Greek Letter community in Second Life, and while I sometimes take issue with the wider community (a blog post for another day), I am often amazed by the ingenuity and creativity you can find within it. This past week really brought that home for me, as my organization helped fellow Greeks Kappa Theta Phi II with their fall vacation event, Chalet Valdoro Fall Festival. The week-long event focused on smaller roleplay activities, from wine tasting and horseback riding (which AΩM hosted) to scuba diving, karaoke, and even an actual horse derby. Each event gave participants the opportunity to get to know one another, crack a few jokes, and unwind. It offered everyone a chance to step away from the hustle and bustle of the real world and experience, in essence, a vacation they might not be able to afford or find time for otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/ac1c726a-3811-4cde-b158-0189d9358510/Valdoro+Air.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">It also gave me the chance to remember why my first foray into online gaming was virtual worlds and making connections. Over time, I have become less and less social. I\'ve always been shy, but over the last few years, I\'ve somewhat become a hermit. I stick to my group and only my group, rarely venturing into new experiences and heavily vetting anyone I deal with. And yes, when you think sorority, you think social butterflies, so I know there is a weird juxtaposition there, which is why this week has been huge for me. During our wine tasting event, we tried something new for AΩM with a “Hot Ones” style segment inspired by the YouTube series, and everyone loved it. Three other organizations have already said they want to join in next time since we plan to film future sessions and share them on social media. As a matter of fact, I spent much of this morning joking around with some of the other people staying at the resort on the dedicated Discord server. We\'ve talked about collaborating on another vacation event and working together on our upcoming charity drives. There has been a real building of community this week that reminds me it\'s okay to step outside your comfort zone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/3797d40c-f54d-456d-84f7-61288e34d897/Hot+Ones.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/8be48f08-8149-44b3-805e-a1ac80cf61c8/Brunch+Time.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/f3400f94-6f3d-46b2-9d7d-1f6475bdf87d/Crystal+Cave.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">Second Life is full of subcultures most people never see, and Greek life is one of its most enduring and creative. What this week reminded me is that behind every avatar, there’s a person looking for connection, laughter, and belonging. The bonds we build through roleplay might start as stories, but over time they become something very real. If you\'re curious about how organizations like Alpha Omega Mu operate, or want to learn more about Greek roleplay in Second Life, let me know in the comments. I’d love to share more about this side of the world in a future post.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1760050772090-M0870QX6B7U66AZ99ZXZ/Off+to+Italy.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

As we looked out over the bay, I was struck by two things: how vast this world is, and how I ended up here with these two men. They call me a friend, and I am still in awe of them. To listen to them honor one another was humbling. Though tonight their words were not meant for me, but for each other, I felt them all the same. The struggle to live up to what once was, to what others believe we should be, is a battle I know all too well.</p><p class="">Eight years of war have carried me to this place. The Broken Isles, Zandalar and Kul Tiras, the otherworldly Shadowlands, and the Dragon Isles. One battleground after another, each demanding more of me, more of us, but each leaving scars unique to the person. For me, there was no pause, no moment to breathe until now. Listening to Thrall and Anduin, I realize that in war, none of us walk free of the dead. We simply learn to live beside them.</p><p class="">For the first time I can feel the calm before the storm. There is a charge in the air, but the wind that carries it is gentle and warm. I do not know how long it will last. I wish it would last forever. I know it is foolish to think the fighting is over. Even when the battlefield falls silent, the war never truly ends. But in this quiet, I find myself yearning. Yearning to understand how I, a simple Farstrider from Quel’Thalas, ended up here. What was the moment? What was the choice?</p><p class="">And yet, it is silly of me to even ask those questions. I know the answer. I might be too afraid to speak them aloud, but I know them. Perhaps during this in-between, I should read some of my old journals, to look back with some perspective. They do say time helps to round out the edges. So maybe, in reading my journals, I can be gentler with my choices, and if not that, then maybe just gentler with myself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=""><em>Author’s Note:</em><br />This marks the start of Zanaia’s story.

And honestly? That feels amazing. Fun escapism is on the horizon, and I’m here for it.</p><h4>Legion Remix</h4><p class="">Aside from the power-leveling of alts and awesome rewards, I have a feeling there are a few reasons why this is one of the expansions they decided to remix. From what I understand, Legion was one of the more popular expansions, but the end of the expansion also has strong lore ties to what is going on currently. I feel like they want us to go back for the story, or at least I want to go back for the story, and I’m just hoping they want us to as well.</p><p class="">I also think this ties into why they did the Mists of Pandaria remix, which I unfortunately missed. After watching episode 5 of a lore and history series on YouTube, <em>Before the Mists: What was Pandaria really like?</em> from Quaylin, I’ve been thinking a lot about the Thunder King and all the lore and history in Pandaria. (Also, highly recommend that series if you like lore: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEyTJ3_GpaHRKIZ31190_-OuxCTfCafXZ&amp;si=b-EWYQynXZojo_0O" target="_blank">Quaylin’s Playlist</a>).</p><p class="">On top of that, I want to create a short story that might turn into something longer for a character I’ve had in the back of my mind. Most, if not all, of my WoW characters have a backstory, but there’s one story in particular I want to play around with. I’m hoping it’ll help get me back into writing creatively and also make me a better writer. You know, the whole “practice makes perfect” thing. The first in that series is coming out next week, and I’m pretty excited about it.</p><h4>Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity</h4><p class="">As most of my friends know, I adore Guild Wars 2. It has such rich and deep lore, plus it does a really great job of giving you the story via your hero panel if you’ve been away awhile and forgotten what you were up to. Kind of like a gaming bookmark. On top of that, the game is visually stunning, and they just do a lot of things well that I feel some games (<em>cough</em> World of Warcraft <em>cough</em>) take and use for their own. Warbands, I’m looking at you.</p><p class="">I also recently got some new friends into the game. It’s such a delight seeing new players enjoy Guild Wars 2. At first, one of my friends was like, <em>“Oh, I’ll play when you’re on.”</em> Then the next thing I know, they went out and started exploring on their own. I was so proud of them! They’re gamers, but MMOs haven’t really been their thing before. Sadly, Lost Ark was their first MMO, and I was like, <em>“Girl, that is not a game you want to start with.”</em></p><p class="">And of course, the Halloween event is right around the corner. In real life, I’m not the hugest Halloween fan, but there’s something about the Guild Wars 2 version that brings me so much joy. It’s campy and lighthearted, with just the right touch of spooky and decoration. It’s always a good time, and I’m really looking forward to experiencing it with my friends.</p><h4>Dispatch &amp; Anno 117</h4><p class="">I’m looking forward to Dispatch and Anno 117 for different but also similar reasons. They’re both the kinds of games I love to sink into when I’m feeling socially overwhelmed and want to game without any pressure.</p><p class=""><strong>Anno 117</strong> is a city builder (my absolute favorite genre) that will take us to the Roman Empire this time around. I can’t wait to experiment with creating a city that not only functions well but also looks beautiful.</p><p class=""><strong>Dispatch</strong>, on the other hand, is a story-driven, choices-matter RPG with a superhero twist. It features an incredible cast of actors, including two of my favorites from the voice acting world, Travis Willingham and Laura Bailey, as well as Jeffrey Wright. I LOVE Jeffrey Wright.</p><p class="">Both games are ones I know I’ll enjoy for months and months: replaying Dispatch to explore different choices, and perfecting the greatest city I can in Anno.</p><h4>WoW Player Housing</h4><p class="">I cannot even contain my excitement for player housing coming to WoW. I love to decorate in any game that lets me, which is why I adore city builders. Decorating scratches a creative itch for me since I can’t really do that in real life. HGTV is one of my all-time favorite channels, and I’ve basically been using games as my own personal HGTV show ever since The Sims 1 released.</p><p class="">The controls for decorating in WoW also look really similar to Second Life, which I have a lot of experience with. I even have an interior design business in SL, so I know I’ll be able to pull off some pretty amazing things. Once December 2nd rolls around, I’m going to be knee-deep in not only decorating my house but also leveling up the renown for it so I can have <em>all the things</em>!</p><p class="">I also plan to showcase myself decorating and the whole process that goes into it. That should be a lot of fun, kind of like a virtual MMO version of HGTV. Maybe that’ll be the moment I give YouTube another try… probably not, but at the very least I have this space to share all my design ideas.</p><h4>Countdown to Cozy Chaos</h4><p class="">So that is everything on the horizon until the end of the year. I haven’t had this much gaming content to bring me joy in such a long time. It’s hard not to be overwhelmed, but also it feels like being a kid waiting for their birthday or Christmas. Which is ironic because both my birthday and Christmas will be in the middle of all these things.</p><p class="">So if you need me between now and the holidays, you’ll find me happily lost in one of these worlds. Much excite, indeed.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759370554986-2X8R5BJOO4FD5A3AAJ7H/Much+Excite.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

To say I’ve blogged in the past would be an understatement. I’ve had several, all short lived, so we’ll see how this goes. Lately the quick bursts I toss on Mastodon don’t feel like enough. “But blogging? That’s so old school,” I hear you say. Yes, a blog. I know it’s 2025, but I don’t want to stream. Making YouTube videos isn’t on the table for now. So here we are. Fingers to keyboard, thoughts to screen.</p><p class="">So what is this place? Exactly what it says on the tin: a blog. A spot to pull together the ways I play, explore, and create in games. Sometimes that means roleplay stories where characters start writing themselves. Other times it’s screenshots that capture moments I want to hold onto. And sometimes it’s just me reflecting on the gaming experience, the joy, the chaos, the little obsessions of whatever I’m into that week.</p><p class="">My gaming tastes are all over the map, and that’s how I like it. One day I’m chasing achievements in Guild Wars 2. The next I’m running delves in World of Warcraft. Or desperately trying to keep the tiny people in Frostpunk from freezing to death. If it’s a world worth exploring or a puzzle worth figuring out, odds are I’ll end up there.</p><p class="">Ready Pixel One isn’t about guides or dissecting patch notes. It’s about what happens inside the games and inside my head while I play them. It’s the spark of a new MMO story, the random character I get too attached to, the screenshots I can’t stop taking. A mix of RP stories, personal reflections, and snapshots from the journey.</p><p class="">This first post is just me setting the stage. There’s more to come, characters to meet, worlds to visit, and plenty of pixels to share along the way.</p><p class="">So… Pixel One has joined the game.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759292672837-C734CUZR5FF3N0TH5AYW/Ready+Pixel+One.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

Though it is intentional to have multiple of the same socket type it is not intentional to have multiple of the exact same charm itself. If you are in this state any duplicate charms do not stack and you are wasting perk space. An additional note that it is intended for multiple variant perks such as Void Protection II &amp; Flame Protection II to roll on the same items. There is diminishing returns when stacking perks and its something we are watching.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Spider Cave: There was a cave that was giving out a considerable volume of loot that attracted players to it. Overall much of this loot is what I would consider entry gear for endgame and much of the chase will be around sets and 4 sockets. If it werent for the performance concerns, we would have left it. With that being said I will look towards alternative paths long term like this without congregating every last one of you to the same spot.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I added a known issue where upgrading artifacts final perk can revert your gs back down to 700 if you have spent umbral.

Items would stay 3 socket. Sorry noticed that in the first paragraph.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; From above - An additional note that it is intended for multiple variant perks such as Void Protection II &amp; Flame Protection II to roll on the same items.

Overall much of this loot is what I would consider entry gear for endgame and much of the chase will be around sets and 4 sockets. If it werent for the performance concerns, we would have left it. With that being said I will look towards alternative paths long term like this without congregating every last one of you to the same spot.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I added a known issue where upgrading artifacts final perk can revert your gs back down to 700 if you have spent umbral. We are working on a fix for this. For now I would recommend against it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Focused on getting fixes for gear and content ASAP so I am less active in here than the last week apologies.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sorry for the delay in responses from me, I have been busy working on fixes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Edit for clarity: Replace old perks with new perks not new sockets. Items would stay 3 socket. Sorry noticed that in the first paragraph.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; From above - An additional note that it is intended for multiple variant perks such as Void Protection II &amp; Flame Protection II to roll on the same items. There is diminishing returns when stacking perks and its something we are watching. Yes this is by design currently. I cant speak to all the math behind it though thats more the combat teams deal.</i></blockquote><br /><br /><p></p>', 'links': [{'href': 'http://www.heartlessgamer.com/feeds/4411511147890274521/comments/default', 'rel': 'replies', 'title': 'Post Comments', 'type': 'application/atom+xml'}, {'href': 'http://www.heartlessgamer.com/2025/10/nighthaven-day-2-aka-what-is-up-with.html#comment-form', 'rel': 'replies', 'title': '0 Comments', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/13266751/posts/default/4411511147890274521', 'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml'}, {'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/13266751/posts/default/4411511147890274521', 'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml'}, {'href': 'http://www.heartlessgamer.com/2025/10/nighthaven-day-2-aka-what-is-up-with.html', 'rel': 'alternate', 'title': 'Nighthaven Day 2 AKA WHAT IS UP WITH PERKS AND GEAR!?', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'heartlessgamer', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/02809717223567961650', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'heartlessgamer', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/02809717223567961650', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': '', 'author': 'heartlessgamer (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'height': '32', 'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfrHfTNjKaAn-j-xyGqY6L4_fdF2ODhbhSc664B9qvTQlBBV3IY3vxjvP1Asfpxcw8rKeNnXu3vQdJ6szvB4HvKpTGf7dUSML8w-mQz57SDKagnunydYEsqNhp3CLfK3hLcwoME_QOQGf5A8GNC1THAmNCDBR6loa_2-vRtaleOXdn9iA/s220/hgamerprofile.jpg', 'width': '32'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'height': '72', 'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRj4NyO5g4dgergEL98PklZILVoSsgkPE_VRepZs1pr42RkiT3AiYxWWvJSOm8xccmxAuliv3e54aD7BzC-zgVljy_-GHLnGBsYwcFIuzlX3Er6Nn3eDxvxUPbnGN_1mMgfYAaTt9RJQBxaNcNJhA9hCyboTdijgMPsFiutijZOlKKchwxHShgaQ/s72-w322-h640-c/ench%20ward.png', 'width': '72'}], 'thr_total': '0'}

Some doors open and you walk through; others are a teleport.&nbsp; I am not the biggest fan of this design choice; I\'d prefer all doors work equally the same.</li><li>I made level 70 at the end of my play session.&nbsp; I still am in progress on the main story quest and have multiple side quests in the new zone to pick up yet.&nbsp; I won\'t complain about fast leveling but had hoped I\'d of needed to invest a little more time and effort to max my level.</li><li>I was able to upgrade one item to 780 GS with the umbrals that I achieved via the quests and a few PvP arena matches.&nbsp; Per the dev notes we should be able to get 5 pieces upgraded to 800 each week which means likely 2 weeks for a full set.</li><li>Holy gear drops! Everything is dropping gear.&nbsp; I have so much stuff in my inventory and I didn\'t even take advantage of the bugged super loot party that they patched out!&nbsp; Since the new gear and upgrade system is new I am not sure what to salvage and what not to, but I am going to need to spend some time here because I can\'t keep going at this pace filling up storage!</li><li>Attributes were squashed and with it the amount of damage players are doing is way down.&nbsp; PvP encounters last longer and feel less spikey.&nbsp; Also heavy armor players feel less tanky.&nbsp; We are all still on old gear so I am sure this will change as we all move towards 800 GS.</li><li>Performance has been great for me in the open world but FPS dips&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Things I still need to try:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Catacombs; the new 3 person procedural dungeons</li><li>The launch version of the new OPR map; Tower of Calomel</li><li>Playing around with perk charms</li></ul><p>Some screenshots to go with the adventures</p><p>&nbsp;<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

I put in a few hours last night and made some progress through the new zone and story quests.&nbsp; Here are some quick thoughts.</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The visual are amazing and it is a treat to run across the zone and explore the numerous locations.&nbsp; Multiple locations have spyglasses at their highest points that give a cinematic view of nearby locations which has driven me to immediately go explore further.</li><li>Sound is bugged and in some instances deafening as loud bell sounds or loud metal grating sounds override everything else.&nbsp; This makes combat feel off and required me to reduce over all volume in the game to save my sanity.&nbsp; It seems to mostly be an issue in indoor areas.</li><li>Doors.&nbsp; So many doors.&nbsp; There are several haunted castles and catacombs that are interconnected mini-areas separated by doors. Some doors open and you walk through; others are a teleport.&nbsp; I am not the biggest fan of this design choice; I\'d prefer all doors work equally the same.</li><li>I made level 70 at the end of my play session.&nbsp; I still am in progress on the main story quest and have multiple side quests in the new zone to pick up yet.&nbsp; I won\'t complain about fast leveling but had hoped I\'d of needed to invest a little more time and effort to max my level.</li><li>I was able to upgrade one item to 780 GS with the umbrals that I achieved via the quests and a few PvP arena matches.&nbsp; Per the dev notes we should be able to get 5 pieces upgraded to 800 each week which means likely 2 weeks for a full set.</li><li>Holy gear drops! Everything is dropping gear.&nbsp; I have so much stuff in my inventory and I didn\'t even take advantage of the bugged super loot party that they patched out!&nbsp; Since the new gear and upgrade system is new I am not sure what to salvage and what not to, but I am going to need to spend some time here because I can\'t keep going at this pace filling up storage!</li><li>Attributes were squashed and with it the amount of damage players are doing is way down.&nbsp; PvP encounters last longer and feel less spikey.&nbsp; Also heavy armor players feel less tanky.&nbsp; We are all still on old gear so I am sure this will change as we all move towards 800 GS.</li><li>Performance has been great for me in the open world but FPS dips&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Things I still need to try:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Catacombs; the new 3 person procedural dungeons</li><li>The launch version of the new OPR map; Tower of Calomel</li><li>Playing around with perk charms</li></ul><p>Some screenshots to go with the adventures</p><p>&nbsp;<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

Today, there’s <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank">an update about how ARC Raiders will handle character wipes</a>. The system is called <strong>Projects</strong> and is optional. It offers players who want to wipe their character and start over fresh the chance to do so—gaining some bragging rights and cosmetic rewards in the process. I think this is an interesting take on the topic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Many online action games with player progression systems have implemented the concept of “wipes” with the intent to reset everything back to even on a set cadence. The goal is to keep the game fresh for veteran players and ensure that newer players can enjoy the game without staring at a mountain of progress to get on equal footing with the veterans. This makes sense for dedicated veterans and new players alike but misses what is likely the biggest player group: what I call the “core gamer.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;These core gamers, like myself, can’t put massive hours per week into a game, and thus, games with wipes become less attractive because the destination never feels reachable. We are always stuck in the progression step, and while progression is an attractive feature in the games we play, it’s the persistence of that progression that’s the main draw in the first place. Restarting after a mandatory wipe just feels bad. My friend and I quit <strong>Once Human</strong>, a game we both were enjoying, after the first wipe we were subjected to. We found ourselves logging in the next day irritated at the prospect of cutting down a hundred trees and breaking up a hundred rocks again to set out on the same journey we had just felt we’d reached an established point in.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;ARC Raiders</strong> smartly acknowledges that players like me are a core audience for their game, and the Projects concept seems like a good middle ground for all player groups—veterans, newbies, and the core alike. I really like how they’ve framed their decision here:</p><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides. Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall. So, as we have done with several other mechanics, before mimicking other established mechanics, we’d like to try our own method. Ideally to the end that best suits ARC Raiders and a larger majority of its players."&nbsp;</i></blockquote><p></p><p>The main concept of the Projects is that their initiation is <strong>player-controlled</strong>. If I have time in my upcoming gaming schedule, I can opt to start the project, and that will reset my character; my efforts will then go into the project. If I want to play the game more casually, without dedicated time in the schedule, then I don\'t have to start the project; I just keep on with my persistent progression.</p>\n<p>There are still details to understand about how players on Projects interact with those that are not. I assume they will be mixed into matches to avoid creating a queue issue where players are waiting for matches to start. This would be ideal in my book, as it would mix players pursuing different goals into the same matches—and if there is anything ARC Raiders excels at, it’s player-versus-player confrontation.</p>\n<p>Also, it will be key to enabling friends to play together that those on a Project can still play with those that are not. There are likely some considerations to avoid abuse—where, if a project (as featured in the article) requires certain items, those items can\'t just be given to a player by another player dropping them in a match. But the death knell for this type of system and game would be creating a barrier to friends playing together, so I can\'t imagine they\'d block players based on Project status.</p>\n<p>The one area I expect to be a hot topic is rewards. As noted in the post, the intent is for Projects to have a non–game-impacting reward structure. So, no combat bonuses just because you finished a project and another player did not. For some players, that may be a reason to question why they would even participate in a project if the reward is only intangible stuff like cosmetics or bragging rights. But just like the element of how wipes don’t respect the time of many players, giving those that complete Projects an advantage would also be a problem for those same players. I suspect that player group is larger than those that want an advantage for completing a Project. Lots of us “core gamers” love our cosmetics and bragging rights when we have the time to work on them and aren’t forced into them.</p>\n<p>Overall, I like what I see here. There are lots of details to be felt out, and there will be questions about how fast and effectively new projects can be brought in. Even though the core gamers don’t want wipes, they do want fresh and new content—and a subset of us will be starting every project that comes down the pipeline. Veterans will sweat out every one of them, and new players will jump in and join us on the same journey!</p>'}], 'summary': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtmy3oTH4LPO2oTPJk3EbnObj_nr9Gdq7kAjgWhm3VR2GUdg_md3iFNFusp7sUM3lOa7wkVUMAcFRs4mV78VK-RWInpf0JPvh5tsVqEKSxXCqdx-ZB_T_35WJHmFBBt6rtkDa7krBNlKr-_v-_AIR7T1Sn9hWNnStxFHZLbMG83osthDf6GjJdKQ/s2560/ARCRaiders_CaravanScreenshot.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="ARC Raiders projects" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtmy3oTH4LPO2oTPJk3EbnObj_nr9Gdq7kAjgWhm3VR2GUdg_md3iFNFusp7sUM3lOa7wkVUMAcFRs4mV78VK-RWInpf0JPvh5tsVqEKSxXCqdx-ZB_T_35WJHmFBBt6rtkDa7krBNlKr-_v-_AIR7T1Sn9hWNnStxFHZLbMG83osthDf6GjJdKQ/w640-h360/ARCRaiders_CaravanScreenshot.png" title="ARC Raiders projects" width="640" /></a></div>&nbsp;<p></p><p>&nbsp;The news drip from <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> is speeding up as we march towards the October 30th launch date.

If I have time in my upcoming gaming schedule, I can opt to start the project, and that will reset my character; my efforts will then go into the project. If I want to play the game more casually, without dedicated time in the schedule, then I don\'t have to start the project; I just keep on with my persistent progression.</p>\n<p>There are still details to understand about how players on Projects interact with those that are not. I assume they will be mixed into matches to avoid creating a queue issue where players are waiting for matches to start. This would be ideal in my book, as it would mix players pursuing different goals into the same matches—and if there is anything ARC Raiders excels at, it’s player-versus-player confrontation.</p>\n<p>Also, it will be key to enabling friends to play together that those on a Project can still play with those that are not. There are likely some considerations to avoid abuse—where, if a project (as featured in the article) requires certain items, those items can\'t just be given to a player by another player dropping them in a match. But the death knell for this type of system and game would be creating a barrier to friends playing together, so I can\'t imagine they\'d block players based on Project status.</p>\n<p>The one area I expect to be a hot topic is rewards. As noted in the post, the intent is for Projects to have a non–game-impacting reward structure. So, no combat bonuses just because you finished a project and another player did not. For some players, that may be a reason to question why they would even participate in a project if the reward is only intangible stuff like cosmetics or bragging rights. But just like the element of how wipes don’t respect the time of many players, giving those that complete Projects an advantage would also be a problem for those same players. I suspect that player group is larger than those that want an advantage for completing a Project. Lots of us “core gamers” love our cosmetics and bragging rights when we have the time to work on them and aren’t forced into them.</p>\n<p>Overall, I like what I see here. There are lots of details to be felt out, and there will be questions about how fast and effectively new projects can be brought in. Even though the core gamers don’t want wipes, they do want fresh and new content—and a subset of us will be starting every project that comes down the pipeline. Veterans will sweat out every one of them, and new players will jump in and join us on the same journey!</p>', 'links': [{'href': 'http://www.heartlessgamer.com/feeds/2027077907162159803/comments/default', 'rel': 'replies', 'title': 'Post Comments', 'type': 'application/atom+xml'}, {'href': 'http://www.heartlessgamer.com/2025/10/arc-raiders-projects.html#comment-form', 'rel': 'replies', 'title': '0 Comments', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/13266751/posts/default/2027077907162159803', 'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml'}, {'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/13266751/posts/default/2027077907162159803', 'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml'}, {'href': 'http://www.heartlessgamer.com/2025/10/arc-raiders-projects.html', 'rel': 'alternate', 'title': 'ARC Raiders Projects', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'heartlessgamer', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/02809717223567961650', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'heartlessgamer', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/02809717223567961650', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': '', 'author': 'heartlessgamer (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'height': '32', 'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfrHfTNjKaAn-j-xyGqY6L4_fdF2ODhbhSc664B9qvTQlBBV3IY3vxjvP1Asfpxcw8rKeNnXu3vQdJ6szvB4HvKpTGf7dUSML8w-mQz57SDKagnunydYEsqNhp3CLfK3hLcwoME_QOQGf5A8GNC1THAmNCDBR6loa_2-vRtaleOXdn9iA/s220/hgamerprofile.jpg', 'width': '32'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'height': '72', 'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtmy3oTH4LPO2oTPJk3EbnObj_nr9Gdq7kAjgWhm3VR2GUdg_md3iFNFusp7sUM3lOa7wkVUMAcFRs4mV78VK-RWInpf0JPvh5tsVqEKSxXCqdx-ZB_T_35WJHmFBBt6rtkDa7krBNlKr-_v-_AIR7T1Sn9hWNnStxFHZLbMG83osthDf6GjJdKQ/s72-w640-h360-c/ARCRaiders_CaravanScreenshot.png', 'width': '72'}], 'thr_total': '0'}

The game appears (and plays) like an aquatic combination of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/18/coffee-talk-review/">Coffee Talk</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/15/steamworld-dig-2-review/">SteamWorld Dig</a></em>, which are both games I very much enjoy. I downloaded <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> upon release on Switch, but it fell into my backlog until this year; in recent months, I&#8217;ve gotten around to properly playing through the game, and I&#8217;m glad I did so &#8211; not only does it deliver on the rewarding gameplay loop and sumptuous pixel art graphics I hoped for, but it&#8217;s been an ideal showcase for chilled handheld gaming on the Nintendo Switch 2!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting the review, I&#8217;d like to mention the brief controversy around <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, as I remember it adding unfair caution to my approach to the game. Back in 2023, the game was nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards, which drew criticism because the game wasn&#8217;t an Indie game &#8211; the developer MINTROCKET was a subsidiary of Nexon, a lucrative South Korean company. The developers were not responsible for the game being nominated, and it appears that the nomination was based off of the pixel art graphics and relaxed alternative vibe of the game, instead of the literal definition of an independent company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, the CEO of MINTROCKET &#8211; and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> creator &#8211; Jaeho Hwang said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>“I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like a more detailed explanation and opinion, I highly recommend <a href="https://indiecator.org/2023/11/15/why-is-dave-the-diver-not-indie/">this post on <em>Indiecator</em> by MagiWasTaken</a>, which discusses the situation in better detail than I could in this short review introduction. Ironically, it&#8217;s since been announced in 2024 that MINTROCKET is becoming independent (albeit with support from Nexon to carry out the move). My main point is that this controversy is not something to think ill of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> or MINTROCKET for, and that allowed me to dive into the game fresh. Right, that&#8217;s enough preamble, so let&#8217;s get into the review!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Catch of the Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> follows the story of Dave and his friends, who&#8217;ve travelled to the oceanic Blue Hole to set up a sushi restaurant called Bancho Sushi (named after the head chef Bancho). As the title suggests, Dave must dive underwater to collect the fish and ingredients, and this forms the majority of the game &#8211; you must balance risk and reward as you collect as much as Dave can carry, whilst keeping track of your oxygen levels and means to get back to the surface &#8211; either by swimming back up, or finding an Escape Pod point. If you run out of oxygen and get stranded underwater, you lose all but one of your collected items, which severely impacts the success of the sushi restaurant in the evenings. This risk/reward system is reminiscent of the digging in <em>SteamWorld Dig</em>, and is implemented superbly here &#8211; the player has to make the tough decision between keeping what they&#8217;ve got, or risking pushing a little further and potentially losing it all. It&#8217;s a brilliant gameplay loop that keeps you coming back for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15160" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15140" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15139" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The game eases you in gently, starting with introducing the mechanics of catching fish at a relatively shallow depth. Your main weapon is the harpoon, which can be fired in front of you to reel in fish. However, there&#8217;s a delay whilst the fish struggles, which gives other dangerous creatures the time to close in on Dave &#8211; and later on, the harpoon requires multiple hits and/or extra button combinations to capture stronger fish. There are also various items to discover and collect, either as supplementary ingredients found in submerged cooking pots, or as materials scattered on the sea floor. Dave only has a certain amount they can hold at once, which quickly becomes reason to earn the Gold needed for upgrading your Cargo Box storage limit &#8211; as well as your Air Tank, Harpoon Gun, and more. In turn, this motivates the player for the sushi segments of the game; depending on how well the restaurant performs in the evenings, the more Gold you&#8217;ll earn for upgrades. Both sides of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> continue to ingeniously compliment each other in this way, as success in one helps you in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the sushi segments are rather different from the diving, and this is where my earlier comparison to <em>Coffee Talk</em> comes in. After setting sail to Bancho Sushi, you start by going through a list of your possible dishes to serve in your evening menu; your selection is based upon the fish you&#8217;ve caught and the ingredients you&#8217;ve acquired. The quality and quantity of your haul determines your success, as rarer fish open up more expensive dishes that result in a more lucrative evening. Upon selecting each dish, you can also enhance it if you have enough excess ingredients &#8211; a process given extra visual flair by the wonderful animated cutscenes of Bancho preparing the food. These animations aren&#8217;t limited to just Bancho, and are sprinkled throughout <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, such as when weapons expert Duff upgrades your guns. Each of these sequences has a tongue-in-cheek over-exaggerated tone, and add to the playful charm of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15133" height="360" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif?w=640" width="640" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in Bancho Sushi you can browse and sell your ingredients for quickfire Gold, as well as decorate the restaurant as you see fit, and even hire extra members of staff to help you out. The latter are essential, as over time the restaurant gets busier; once you open the restaurant, you control Dave as he serves dishes and maintains the restaurant, and hiring extra hands to help is key to success. Whether it&#8217;s pouring drinks, dashing around to serve sushi plates, cleaning up, or keeping Bancho well-stocked with sushi, this is a frenetic <em>Overcooked</em>-style part of the game that contrasts well with the diving. It&#8217;s certainly not as layered as the underwater gameplay, but it&#8217;s not supposed to be, and does a successful job at giving the player a break between each dive. Plus, it&#8217;s extremely satisfying to see the profits come in &#8211; which can then be spent on upgrades the next day, when the cycle begins anew&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Just Keep Swimming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this core gameplay loop, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> steadily introduces new characters and locations throughout the seven main story chapters. They&#8217;re an eclectic bunch, each with their own expertise and side quests. Archaeologist Dr. Bacon propels the main story forward; as you dive deeper, you discover much more than just fish, including secret civilizations and bigger ecological threats to the Blue Hole &#8211; the latter of which is tracked by the biologist Ellie, who gives you various collection tasks through the Ecowatcher app. Speaking of which, your progress is mostly tracked via these apps, which are accessed via the efficient menu on Dave&#8217;s smartphone. To give a few examples: you might use the phone to acquire and upgrade weapons (with the help of the aforementioned Duff); you might browse your snaps for photographer Udo; or you might look through your Pokémon-style Marinca collection for Sato, an Ash Ketchum lookalike!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15146" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15153" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15154" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between all these characters and side quests, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> has something for everyone. If you like collecting then you can focus on filling out the Marinca (essentially a Pokédex for fish), if you like the sushi-management side you can focus on optimising your earnings, and if you like exploring then you can focus on the diving. Whichever way you play, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> smartly manages to naturally push the story on regardless &#8211; for example, a character named Otto opens a farm partway into the game, where you can grow crops such as rice. Growing these ingredients helps you to reliably create more valuable dishes in the evening; but to help out Otto and subsequently build up the farm, you need to collect certain items, which requires becoming proficient at the diving. Each element of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> gently motivates the others in this way, and therefore pushes the player to test out every facet of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a side effect of this admirable gameplay variety is that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> occasionally inserts under-baked minigames or quick time events. One instance of this is the cooking competition side missions, where you must gather ingredients for Bancho as you normally would, but upon doing so, you must then engage in first-person cooking challenges. These consist of basic button presses and directional inputs, and feel like a rushed version of either a <em>Cooking Mama</em> or <em>Mario Party</em> minigame. It was the rare moment in <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> where I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15123" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15124" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15127" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15136" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, some of these asides work better than others &#8211; a relatively quick soldering minigame is an enjoyable and brief inclusion, and there&#8217;s a compelling <em>Balatro</em>-style card game, but on the other hand, a one-time stealth sequence is particularly badly designed. These hiccups are rare enough that they don&#8217;t significantly detract from <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, but they were also noticeable enough that I had to mention them in this review. They just feel unnecessary &#8211; it&#8217;s as if <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> felt it had to extend itself beyond the main gameplay loop that it executes so superbly. If anything, the high quality of the core diving-and-sushi-selling gameplay only make the brief diversions more jarring.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Deadly Depths</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the various other side missions and gameplay mechanics, it&#8217;s the diving that&#8217;s understandably the focus of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, and it&#8217;s exceptionally well-balanced. As aforementioned, your initial harpoon is a unique weapon to master &#8211; but Dave can also carry one firearm, either by collecting them underwater or by crafting them beforehand. There&#8217;s a range of weapon types: you might use the Net Gun for catching large swathes of fish, or perhaps the Grenade Launcher for explosive damage, or even (my weapon of choice) the Sniper Rifle for long-range damage. The latter is especially handy when tackling sea life that is aggressive at close range, such as the many sharks patrolling the Blue Hole!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15161" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Dave isn&#8217;t just reeling in small fish. You&#8217;ll soon be fighting not only sharks, but hostile jellyfish, giant squids, and plenty more! Significant story events are often accompanied by a boss fight against a dangerous opponent such as these, introduced with stylish freeze frames reminiscent of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and signifying the stakes of the encounter. Additionally, new areas of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> can be a trial by fire, with enemies that suddenly reduce huge amounts of your oxygen supply (which doubles as a health bar of sorts) with a single hit. However, the challenge rarely felt unfair, and any failed dives were always down to my own mistakes &#8211; and only left me more motivated to improve my aquatic skills or upgrade my gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, as well as your harpoon and firearm, Dave can carry a melee weapon (also used for mining materials) and two pieces of equipment. The latter of these can vary, from battle items such as a proximity mine, to ways of helping Dave in a pinch, such as portable oxygen refills. Most of these can be found underwater, or alternatively, they can be pre-purchased from Cobra in the boat before starting your dive, adding another way for the player to customise their approach. Overall, there&#8217;s a well-judged balance between giving the player plenty of options, but not giving you so much power that you can become complacent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15142" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15172" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15168" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when you feel comfortable with Dave and his toolset, the missions being asked of you often cleverly push you out of your comfort zone &#8211; and if you&#8217;re not careful, it doesn&#8217;t take much for a dangerous enemy or perilous area to derail your dive and leave you back at the boat almost empty-handed. It&#8217;s oh-so-easy to fall into the trap of completing just one more mission, collecting just one more item, capturing just one more fish &#8211; but equally, there&#8217;s an undeniable thrill to escaping just in time. In the later chapters, missions become more specific to match your increased skills, and particular ingredients can necessitate repeated captures of rare creatures. This cycle reminded me of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and similarly to that series, provides a tangible reason to keep capturing the most elusive fish &#8211; in this case, to find the rarest ingredients and compose the finest dishes at Bancho Sushi!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Under the Sea</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the endearing yet adventurous nature of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the graphical style; the gorgeous pixel-art invites you in, making diving a little deeper &#8211; and playing a little longer &#8211; even more enticing. The shallow regions are full of bright welcoming colours, but the variety only builds from here. Every layer under the water has a unique visual identity, such as the dark Blue Hole Depths, or the extreme cold and heat of later areas. Meanwhile, night-time dives feature a shining kaleidoscope of colourful foliage that feels magical to navigate &#8211; when you&#8217;re not being pursued by deadly fish, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15162" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the human character designs have a palpable sense of personality. This gets more spotlight in the earlier-mentioned animated cutscenes, which blend the stunning pixel art with the tongue-in-cheek humour that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> does so well. By the end of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, the roster of characters have a real sense of camaraderie between them, which contributes to that overall warm and relaxed feeling that the game has. Add in the detailed multitude of marine species and food recipes, and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> really is a delectably beautiful game. Playing it on the large handheld screen <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/09/09/did-my-hopes-for-the-switch-2-become-a-reality/">of the Switch 2</a> has only accentuated this feeling further for me &#8211; and it&#8217;s been a great example for how that console helps the back catalogue of the original Switch to shine even brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial compliment to the visuals of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the music, which is often a wonderfully soothing backdrop to your deep sea exploration. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a notably therapeutic game when you’re just casually collecting fish, exploring the vast swathes of water, and listening to the delicate musical backdrop. My favourite piece of music is for a late-game frozen area, where these tranquil tones morph into a synth-style inspirational beat. Also, music fans will get an extra treat from a certain cameo appearance at Bancho Sushi, who comes complete with a musical performance that I’ve been listening to many times since! Not to be glossed over is the sound design, too &#8211; the sounds of marine life, the tense pull of a harpoon, the whooshing of waves, it all sounds authentic and distinct, and pulls you further into the watery world of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15163" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15148" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg?w=863" width="863" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15150" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing about this game &#8211; it reels you in, not necessarily in a sudden way, but a gradual one. As the in-game days go by, you settle more thoroughly into the gameplay loop, getting more familiar with characters old and new, until they become familiar friends on your adventure. There&#8217;s a sense of pleasing routine to checking your farms for crops and ingredients, then going diving and completing missions, before then preparing for the evening Bancho Sushi business. It&#8217;s a lot like the charm of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> or <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but with the added element of gripping underwater gameplay to go alongside it. The game is kept fresh by the steady incline of options and equipment available to Dave, and this creates an endgame with potentially endless longevity. Even when you finish all of the main story missions, you still have a restaurant business to run, and you can continue building it out to your hearts content. There&#8217;s extra DLC too, two of which (the <em>Dredge</em> and <em>Godzilla</em> tie-in packs) are free, for those looking for extra content!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a delight to play through <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. The mix of gripping gameplay and relaxing sushi simulation &#8211; combined with the incredible art direction and music &#8211; makes for an RPG full of endearing charm and well-meaning adventure. At its heart is whimsy and a sense of positivity, and that soaks through into every part of the game &#8211; and each part compliments the other in a wonderfully natural way. My only criticism is that this enthusiasm leads to the introduction of impromptu minigames and quick time events that sometimes feel underdeveloped in contrast to the main diving gameplay &#8211; but they&#8217;re few and far between, and a drop in the ocean compared to the sea of brilliance within <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. There&#8217;s brilliant longevity built in too &#8211; even after finishing the main story, the diving and sushi restaurant aspects remain, for those who&#8217;d like to continue building Bancho Sushi into the best restaurant it can be. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a treasure of a game, and it comes highly recommended from me!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center

This particular Direct was split into three distinct segments: first about the 40th Anniversary of Mario, then news for the original Nintendo Switch, and then finally information on the Switch 2 &#8211; and altogether it made for a barnstorming hour-long performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo has been on a run of brilliant Directs over the last few years, but this might genuinely be my favourite one for a long while. Many of the announcements in this Direct speak specifically to me and the games I have been looking forward to, and it&#8217;s genuinely made whittling my choices down to five a tough task! If you&#8217;d like to see the full Nintendo Direct, you can do so below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Honourable Mentions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of it being a tough task&#8230; With so much packed into the Direct, I am first going to run through some other announcements that I was glad or intrigued to see, but didn&#8217;t make the cut for the five announcements that appealed most to me personally. The Nintendo Direct started with several <em>Mario </em>announcements in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary: this included a trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> in 2026, as well as a collection of both <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> games for Nintendo Switch, coming October 2nd this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retrospectively, this does make <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/04/lets-chat-3d-mario-games-are-coming-to-switch-but-where-is-galaxy-2/">the decision not to include <em>Galaxy 2</em> in the <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> collection</a> feel very calculated. I personally will likely pass on this new release of the <em>Galaxy </em>games, as the £58.99 cost (or £33.99 separately) feels excessive &#8211; and whilst they are superb games, I doubt I&#8217;ll play them enough when there are so many other new games to play. I do, however, hope to get the physical <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOor7cl-qF_B_yaH1ketH1_ep2UqAIeMsULytGxbXaJ-8c79YpmKe">Rosalina&#8217;s Storybook</a> they are making, as that would be lovely to keep in the collection!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15028" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15029" height="377" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg?w=670" width="670" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15027" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15026" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we got a release date of 4th December for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was great to have confirmed &#8211; and the only reason it isn&#8217;t in my main five picks below is that the new footage left me a bit hesitant. We got to see the new bike Samus will use to traverse the world, and there was something off about it &#8211; the world looked a bit too empty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The footage reminded me of the infamous Mako in the first <em>Mass Effect</em> game, which was also known for wide open spaces that felt empty and were awkward to navigate. Visually, the bike is very cool, and the first-person segments look fantastic, but I was surprised at the briefness of this new footage. I sincerely hope that isn&#8217;t a sign of a lack of confidence in the game; either way, eight years after the initial announcement, I remain very excited for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> to finally launch!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I&#8217;d like to give a mention to the <em>Pokémon</em> segment of the Direct. We got the announcement of a brand new spin-off game named <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, which looks like a mix between<em> Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>, where you play as a Ditto-turned-human (whether this is charming or horrific, you decide)! This game probably won&#8217;t be for me, but I envisage it being very popular, by blending life-sim mechanics with the popularity of the world of <em>Pokémon</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, we got more info for the soon-to-be-released <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, showing off new Mega Evolutions; this segment ended with an announcement of the upcoming <em>Mega Dimension</em> paid DLC, and this felt quite cynical &#8211; it feels strange to have paid DLC announced before we even have the base game. I&#8217;ll wait and see how that DLC materialises, but for now, I&#8217;m fine not seeing much more about <em>Z-A</em>, as I&#8217;m definitely purchasing the game at launch. From here, the Direct transitioned into the surprise announcement of <em>Danganronpa 2&#215;2</em>, a new version of <em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> with added content! I only relatively recently finished (<a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/09/danganronpa-2-goodbye-despair-review-an-ambitious-beautiful-mess-of-a-sequel/">and reviewed</a>) the original game on Switch, and I really enjoyed it overall, so I&#8217;ll be curious to see how much difference the additions make.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15020" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15024" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15025" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15022" height="338" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg?w=600" width="600" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That was quite a long honourable mentions section, wasn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a result of just how many exciting announcements we received; I finished this Direct feeling very optimistic about the future of the Switch 2, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten into my top five reason why! When there are so many announcements, writing this sort of article helps me process the Direct and focus in on the games I&#8217;m going to prioritise playing, and I hope it is an enjoyable read for you too! Right, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#5: Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the most exciting part of the <em>Mario </em>section of the Direct was the announcement of a brand new Yoshi game, named <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em>! Yoshi side-scrollers have a reputation for charming art directions &#8211; for example <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Woolly World</em> and <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Crafted World</em> &#8211; and this game continues that, with a gorgeous stop-motion visual style bursting with colour and personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot of the game follows Yoshi after the appearance of a peculiar book named Mr. E, with pages detailing mysterious creatures. Yoshi jumps into the book (which is the reason for the storybook graphical style) and meets various new creatures, with the details jotted down into the book as Yoshi does so. Completing the storybook of fantastical creatures is an accompaniment to the charming platforming, and there&#8217;s a palpable sense of warmth and whimsy to it all. This game looks ideal for playing on a rainy weekend, wrapped up warm and enjoying the cosy gameplay. I see <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>being a brilliant experience for all ages of players, and I look forward to playing it myself when it releases in Spring 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#4: Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Direct contained the announcements of release dates for several high-profile previously-announced games, and three of these appear on my list. Starting this off is <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>, the third <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> game after the original and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/05/15/my-to-play-list-may-2023-progress/">Age of Calamity</a></em>, which is confirmed to release on November 6th. Just as the latter of those filled in story gaps for <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, one of the main appeals of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is adding story details for <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. Specifically, the time period that Princess Zelda is sent back to in that game &#8211; and I&#8217;m glad to see this time covered more thoroughly, as it felt to me that Zelda was unfairly side-lined in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as a release date, the new footage showed off playable characters such as Queen Sonia, King Rauru, and a new unnamed Korok character. The gameplay looks like the expected <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-esque combat, but there are some additions, such as Zonai devices and multi-character Sync Strikes that change depending on the character combinations. There&#8217;s also the confirmation of local GameShare multiplayer and splitscreen, and glimpses of many epic visual sequences such as airborne Gleeok battles. I accept that the gameplay will likely be repetitive, but for me the appeal of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games is the visual spectacle and extra lore &#8211; and<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> looks to be delivering on that!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#3: Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the brand new announcements of the Direct was that of a new mainline <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, named <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em>. It&#8217;s been wonderful to see <em>Fire Emblem</em> gradually become a household name in the West, with the 3DS games such as <em>Awakening</em> laying the groundwork for <em>Three Houses</em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/14/a-little-zelda-a-lotta-farming-takeaways-from-the-nintendo-direct/">Engage</a> </em>to be massive hits on Switch. The distinction setting <em>Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart is the gladiator-style Heroic Games, which has a multitude of characters competing for the fulfilled wishes that supposedly reward your victory. At the end of the trailer, we see a tease of Sothis, a character from Three Houses &#8211; so it appears there may be a story connection to that game as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the game looks stunning, with gorgeous anime visuals, and clean turn-based strategy UI design. Part of the appeal of <em>Fire Emblem</em> is the stakes of building character relationships in a world where permadeath is possible, and the gladiatorial setting will hopefully provide a fresh twist to that structure that will set<em> Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart. The trailer has a variety of striking characters, and I&#8217;m looking forward to finding my favourites! For now, we only have a general 2026 release date, so I&#8217;d guess that this game will be one of the major late-year releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#2: Resident Evil: Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think it surprising that I&#8217;ve put two already-announced games above the news of a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game; but that&#8217;s a reflection of my adoration for the franchises these next two games are a part of, and how stoked I am to see additional news about their next instalments. Firstly we have <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, the much-anticipated ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> game (if you don&#8217;t count <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/27/resident-evil-zero-review/"><em>Resident Evil Zero</em></a>). This latest entry stars FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she pursues the truth about a deadly virus and the mystery of her mother&#8217;s death &#8211; a path which leads her to the ruins of Raccoon City. This game had already been announced for other consoles, but this is the formal announcement of a Switch 2 version, which is brilliant to see. On Switch, <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/11/25/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/16/resident-evil-village-review/">Resident Evil Village</a></em> could only be played as Cloud games, but the more conventional release of <em>Requiem </em>shows that the console can (for now, at least) keep up with modern large-scale third-party releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually might play <em>Requiem </em>on Switch 2 &#8211; my only other means would be PC or Xbox Series S, and as someone who likes to collect physical copies of <em>Resident Evil</em> games on console, that makes the Switch 2 version more appealing to me. <em>Requiem </em>is up there as one of my most anticipated games; I adore the <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise, and am eagerly awaiting <em>Requiem</em> to see how they interweave the lore of the series into the story. Other than Chris Redfield, we haven&#8217;t had any of the earlier characters show up in the main series since <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, and with the return to Raccoon City, this feels like an ideal time for some guest appearances of older, more experienced versions of those fan favourites. Grace Ashcroft is also the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character from the lesser-known spin-off <em>Resident Evil Outbreak</em> games, which already shows that Capcom is happy playing with some deep-cut lore. I happen to have bought the two <em>Outbreak</em> games second-hand before <em>Requiem</em> was even announced, and am planning to play them before the launch of <em>Requiem </em>and write up my thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Requiem </em>trailer in the Direct was full of intense visuals, threatening figures, and story hints (such as the iconic Umbrella Corporation logo). It struck me that there&#8217;s an underlying grungy tone waiting to break out, which I&#8217;m very excited to discover. This can even be seen in the logo for <em>Requiem</em>, and the burned-out profile shot of Grace near the end of this new trailer. Right now, the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise is in a very healthy place (as healthy a a series about viral monstrosities can be, anyway), and it&#8217;s given Capcom a resulting confidence that could make this game utterly exceptional. They&#8217;re playing their cards close to their chest, concealing the full extent of the horrors that await us on February 27th&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#1: Hades II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yes, oh yes. This is an announcement fans of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/14/hades-review/">Hades</a></em> and Supergiant Games have been awaiting since the reveal of <em>Hades II</em> back at The Game Awards in 2022, and now it&#8217;s here &#8211; the release date of the official 1.0 version, releasing digitally on Switch and PC on September 25th (and physically on November 20th). The first <em>Hades</em> is a phenomenal roguelike action game that turned many players into fans of the genre, but it was quite a surprise when Supergiant announced a sequel &#8211; not only was the first game utterly jam-packed with content and ideas, but they&#8217;d never done a sequel game before. I&#8217;ve purposefully been avoiding details about the game in Early Access, as I&#8217;d like to go in fresh and see what marvels Supergiant have cooked up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon this could be a <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>/<em>Galaxy 2</em> situation, where the developers have so many ideas and so much creativity to share, that they need a whole other game to fit it all in. This time, we play as the immortal Princess of the Underworld, battling against the Titan of Time and exploring an even larger and deeper mythic world of Olympian Gods. In the Direct, this was visualized with a cutscene that gave me goosebumps from the visual flair on show; Supergiant are known for their sumptuous visuals and music, and that&#8217;s very much still the case here. I&#8217;m eager to dive back into the rich gameplay and gripping story of the world of <em>Hades</em>, reuniting with previous characters (Artemis is back!) and meeting new ones. I honestly didn&#8217;t expect the release date to be so soon, but in less than two weeks we&#8217;ll be able to play the 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> &#8211; discovering new Boons, enemies, locations, and more. Bring it on!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>This Nintendo Direct was sensational, and answered many questions about release dates and upcoming games for the Switch 2 (and Switch) release slate. I&#8217;ve been enjoying my gaming a lot recently, and this Direct has only fuelled that passion more &#8211; the only problem is going to be finding the time to play all these games!

It&#8217;s been roughly a year and a half since I wrote that post, and the Switch 2 has been out for just over three months &#8211; so we now have comprehensive knowledge of what the system offers. With the Switch 2, Nintendo took the wise (and safe) approach, capitalising on the continued popularity of the Switch brand and not changing things too drastically. The console is more of an iteration rather than a revolution, but it certainly makes significant changes and upgrades in certain areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had some time with the Switch 2, I thought it&#8217;d be a suitable moment to take a look back at my aforementioned post about my hopes for the console, run one-by-one through the list, and talk about which became a reality (and which didn&#8217;t). Then, at the end of the post, I&#8217;ll summarise my current personal opinions on the Switch 2, taking these results into account. Right then, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Optimize the eShop: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My foremost request was to improve the eShop, which was struggling on multiple fronts on the original Switch: the sheer volume of releases made discoverability of games difficult; there was a lack of quality control; and the user interface was susceptible to noticeable lag. In my opinion, this was one of the most important areas for Nintendo to improve upon &#8211; it might seem less flashy than other aspects, but improving the process of finding new digital games is an underrated key aspect of a modern console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To start on a positive note, I&#8217;m pleased with the way Nintendo has improved the responsiveness of the eShop. I immediately noticed how much quicker and easier it is to navigate the store &#8211; gone are the painful moments waiting for the eShop to catch up with your inputs. Whether this is down to the increased hardware power, general eShop optimisation, or both, it improves the experience of browsing through the available games, and encourages curiosity as a result. In my book, that boost to game discoverability is a win for both the player and the developers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, whilst Nintendo has bolstered the options on the eShop main menu, it&#8217;s not as extensively as I&#8217;d hoped. Most of the options &#8211; such as the Search, Current Offers, and Coming Soon &#8211; are the same, and the only brand new addition is the For You tab, which recommends games based on your own gameplay trends. I was really hoping for some other additions, or even a review system so that players could help to recommend games for others. As it is, the eShop still has the problem of a constant inundation of new games &#8211; and whilst the Popular New Releases sub-section is a step in the right direction, any game that doesn&#8217;t qualify for this (or the Highlights tab) will get very limited time to grab player attention before the spotlight is taken by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14942" height="645" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14940" height="639" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14938" height="624" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14941" height="598" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of quality control, I reserve full judgement until more time has passed, but it seems that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t changed their approach. Lots of cheap-looking games are still flooding the eShop, and there are still Hentai games appearing relatively frequently. From my perspective, Nintendo could still do with raising the bar of entry, in order to curate a higher level of overall quality across the eShop. The current influx of these low-quality games worsens the issue of discoverability for other titles, which get mired amidst them despite taking much more time and effort to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the steps I&#8217;d still like to see taken for more eShop filtering options and better quality control, Nintendo has still significantly improved the eShop, especially in terms of responsiveness. Therefore, I mark this section as a success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More Power: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is that age-old request for new consoles &#8211; that they have more power, and are able to present games in higher framerates and resolutions. Since the Wii/DS era, Nintendo has rarely (if ever) been known as the technical powerhouse, with art direction, creative hardware, and recognizable IP being more important for bringing in players. That said, the Switch 2 is a big step up from the original Switch, with Nvidia claiming that it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nvidia-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">&#8220;10 times the graphical performance&#8221;</a> of the previous console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a technical expert, so I look for comparisons to other consoles to get a handle on where the Switch 2 lands power-wise. The general perception seems to be that at peak performance, docked on a TV, the Switch 2 is comparable to a PlayStation 4 Pro, but still behind the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles &#8211; which essentially matches my prediction back in March 2024. When played in handheld mode, the system is closer to a base PlayStation 4, but that is compensated for by the smaller screen, which often makes games look crisper to the eye (at least for me).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a hybrid system with a handheld option, battery life is another crucial factor to consider, and the increased performance does appear to have hurt the Switch 2 in this area. You generally get around two-three hours when playing any sort of intensive game, which can feel quite short. However, most of the time I don&#8217;t see this being an issue, unless I am on a very long journey &#8211; and it&#8217;s rare not to have a nearby place to plug in and charge. Whilst that isn&#8217;t an excuse, I prefer Nintendo providing stronger hardware and a shorter battery life rather than the opposite, so I&#8217;m still satisfied on this front. For example, I&#8217;m playing <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/09/17/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-14-09-23/">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em> at the moment, and occasionally having to charge the console is a small price to pay for how well it plays and looks in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14949" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14946" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14947" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14948" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When playing in handheld mode, the screen really is stunning; the increased size and power makes games look incredible, and it makes playing in bed (or wherever you prefer) feel like a luxury. The vibrancy and sharpness of the screen &#8211; especially when held close up for handheld gaming &#8211; gave me that new-generation-upgrade feeling that I was looking for. I&#8217;ve heard some disappointment that Nintendo didn&#8217;t use an OLED screen, but in my opinion the LCD screen is more than sufficient, and if it helps keep costs down then that&#8217;s a reasonable trade. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll get an OLED version of the Switch 2 (like for the original Switch) at some point too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only Switch 2-exclusive game I&#8217;ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em> (you can <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/10/mario-kart-world-review-a-stunning-racer-that-misses-a-few-tricks/">read my review here</a>), and as well as being a fantastic game, it doubles as an excellent technical showcase for the Switch 2. Played in 4K HDR on my TV, it looks sensational. The game moves with a crisp fluidity, and the environment feels palpably full of detail and colour. It was upon playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> that it really dawned on me that the Switch 2 was a major &#8211; and timely &#8211; graphical update on its predecessor, allowing it to keep fair pace with the technical state of gaming.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14934" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>All that graphical performance is needed to do justice to the beauty of Cow</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>All in all, whilst my test case for the Switch 2 is relatively limited for now (I haven&#8217;t played upgraded Switch games like <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em> yet either), I&#8217;m confident that the Switch 2 has delivered on the level of power I personally need in a Nintendo console. I don&#8217;t need it to be top-of-the-range; as long as the system is powerful enough to realise the trademark visual flair of first-party Nintendo games, and is able to house a strong line-up of new third-party releases, then that&#8217;s plenty for me. I eagerly await seeing what Nintendo can magic up with their bespoke Switch 2 games in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Clarity on Games: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads nicely into my next point, on the topic of the Switch 2 software line-up now and into the future. A console is defined by the games on it &#8211; and there were two particular games I was waiting for news on when I wrote that original post in March 2024. These were <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> and also the next Nintendo EAD game, which I predicted would be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game in the vein of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. We have received news on both of these games, even if the latter wasn&#8217;t quite the game I expected, as it has instead materialised as <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14932" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I am loving the vibrant purples in this art, by the way</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about <em>Metroid</em>. The development path of the long-awaited <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> has been turbulent, to say the least &#8211; after being announced back in 2017, Nintendo then publicly announced that they were restarting development in 2019, with Retro Studios (the developers of the original <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em>) coming back on board. When I wrote my post about my hopes for the Switch 2, we were still awaiting news on Metroid &#8211; but roughly three months later <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/06/19/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-18-06-2024/">in the June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, Nintendo finally showed us an announcement trailer for the newly-titled <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That initial trailer gave us a taste of the returning first-person <em>Metroid</em> gameplay and a glimpse of returning enemy Sylux, which kept fans occupied until February 2025, when it was announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM&amp;t=1631s">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> that <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> would be a cross-generation title on both Switch and Switch 2. Whilst unsurprising, this was welcome news &#8211; and roughly a month later in March, we got another Nintendo Direct trailer (see below), showing off more of the game and giving us a 2025 release date. This was followed up by an extensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9xes7BZto">Nintendo Treehouse video</a> in April, continuing the steady stream of new information on the game. However, as we enter September, we&#8217;re awaiting news on a precise release date, and I hope we hear more soon. Even if the game has to be pushed into 2026, I wouldn&#8217;t mind &#8211; after so long waiting, I&#8217;d prefer to wait a little longer if it means a better experience. What&#8217;s another few months after eight years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be fascinating to see the comparison between the Switch 2 and Switch editions of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>; the enhanced Switch 2 edition will have Joy-Con 2 mouse controls as well as support for 4K, HDR, and 120 fps! After seeing how brilliant <em>Mario Kart World</em> looks, I&#8217;m excited to experience a new <em>Metroid</em> adventure in these formats &#8211; I have a feeling the game will look sensational. So far, it appears that the game isn&#8217;t straying too far from the gameplay of previous <em>Prime </em>games, and instead refining the first-person formula, with some added tricks such as Psychic Abilities for Samus. I&#8217;m especially intrigued to see where the story goes, and am avoiding too many plot details until release!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, I thought <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was the more outlandish of the two games I was anticipating back in March 2024, as I was confident that a new 3D <em>Mario </em>from Nintendo EAD would be announced. I was both right and wrong &#8211; whilst we haven&#8217;t received a 3D <em>Mario </em>per se, we have gotten a new <em>Mario</em>-adjacent Nintendo EAD 3D game, in the form of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! This was the closing reveal in the Switch 2 Direct back in April; but it wasn&#8217;t until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Direct</a> in June that it was announced this isn&#8217;t just a Donkey Kong game, but a Pauline game as well, with a younger version of the character joining DK on his travels!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo EAD have an amazing track record, and the glowing critical reception to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>has been a continuation of this, praising the sheer gameplay creativity and enjoyment. One of the key features is the ability for Donkey Kong to smash through the environment, reshaping and even creating tunnels through it! The game released on 17th July, and I haven&#8217;t actually played it yet, as I haven&#8217;t found the time to justify spending the money on it. But now <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/">that I&#8217;ve finished the Pokémon League in <em>Pokémon Diamond</em></a> and am taking a break from that, I&#8217;ll hopefully soon get around to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, my next definite Switch 2 purchase will be <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, and I&#8217;m very tempted to get <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> too! There&#8217;s also the question about how series such as <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/10/25/where-can-zelda-go-after-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> might manifest on Switch 2, but I&#8217;m happy having patience &#8211; there are already so many other amazing games to play in the meantime!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More System Customization: No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, here we come to the first of my hopes that didn&#8217;t become a reality. The original Switch only allowed very simple customisation of the Home screen, and Switch 2 hasn&#8217;t evolved this at all, still only allowing two Themes: Basic White and Basic Black (my console is set to the latter). Having a Themes menu suggests the idea of having more options, but I&#8217;m not full of confidence, as we haven&#8217;t received any extra options since the original Switch launch in 2017.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14926" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I like neutral colours, but the option to add more flair could be fun</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not a software developer, it feels like Nintendo is missing an open goal by not allowing us to have Themes based on franchises such as <em>Mario</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, or <em>Metroid</em> &#8211; I honestly think people would even spend a small amount on these, in order to add vibrant new visuals to their systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that Nintendo could still add options in the future, but it&#8217;s disappointing that for now there&#8217;s no word on this. In my March 2024 post, I suggested extra options such as the <em>Nintendo Badge Arcade</em> sticker system on 3DS, but now I feel as if I need to keep expectations in check. At this point, even a couple extra Themes would be great to see.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14928" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Themes menu even seems designed to hold more options</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As on the original Switch, the main way of showing personality is through your profile icon. Nintendo has added extra customisation options over time, particularly via the Nintendo Switch Online menu, where you can unlock new characters, backgrounds, and frames for your profile icon. Whilst it&#8217;s a mostly unchanged process from the Switch, I&#8217;m glad this bit of customisation is still present. I imagine it won&#8217;t be too long until we get more Joy-Con 2 colours, so at least there should soon be that avenue for customising the look of your console (if you have the expendable income). Considering how popular the Switch 2 is, it&#8217;d be wonderful to see more done on the digital side to allow players to show their personality. I hope we see developments in this area in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Enhanced Social Features: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth and final entry on this list regards the social aspects of the Switch &#8211; in my original post, this was primarily about having improved voice chat functions, and thankfully, this is the main social aspect where the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade! After years (and multiple console generations) of players asking, Nintendo has finally added an in-built party voice chat to the Switch 2, named GameChat. It&#8217;s now possible to talk to your registered friends over the internet, using the in-built microphone in the Switch (and Camera, if purchased), even if they are playing different software. Whilst it isn&#8217;t revolutionary &#8211; after all, other consoles have had similar systems for a long time &#8211; it&#8217;s a welcome addition that I&#8217;m very happy to see Nintendo include for the Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous Nintendo consoles have had forms of voice chat, but they always had some sort of catch &#8211; for example on the Switch, where voice chat was tied to the Switch Online mobile app. So, it&#8217;s great to see Nintendo introduce a more complete and in-built offering &#8211; if anything, I feel a bit bad, because I doubt I&#8217;ll use it much. As the years have passed, I&#8217;ve gotten used to using Discord as an alternative form of online chat when playing Nintendo games, because it&#8217;s been more convenient &#8211; and I think it&#8217;ll be hard to break out of that routine. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m very glad GameChat has been added for the Switch 2, and I commend Nintendo for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I hoped to see some sort of extensive social hub added, along the lines of Miiverse or StreetPass. The closest is the Nintendo Switch App, which has new functionality such as uploading screenshots, receiving GameChat notifications, and (most intriguingly) interacting with games such as <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (see the images below). But I miss the in-built communal aspects of previous systems, as they brought people together without as much push towards a mobile app. We still have the News channels to get specific updates on the topics and games you choose to follow, but these are mostly one-way interactions. Nintendo has done well in previous generations at creating unique spaces for players to help shape the multiplayer culture of their consoles, but Switch and Switch 2 feel a bit more controlled in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14922" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14921" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14923" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another aspect that the Switch 2 still lacks is an equivalent to Achievements or Trophies. This is something I used to think was a glaring omission, as it would be a great extra motivation to 100% games such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/04/30/lets-chat-a-long-overdue-super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>. But <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/16/why-ive-stopped-caring-so-much-about-achievements-trophies/">as years have gone by</a>, I have gained respect for Nintendo not having this sort of system, whether it be by conscious decision or simply a lack of intention to do so. There&#8217;s something freeing about playing games on the Switch, and indeed, the Switch 2 &#8211; there&#8217;s a lack of TV/streaming apps, or completion-style Achievement/Trophy systems, and instead the focus is all on the act of playing games. That laser-focus is really refreshing, and I&#8217;m not clamouring for those additions at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, whilst I&#8217;d like to see an expansion into a more communal gaming hub in the future, the Switch 2 definitely delivered on my hope for enhanced social features. The addition of GameChat is one of the major upgrades for the Switch 2, and a lot of marketing and development focus went into it, which shows Nintendo listened to player requests for this type of addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After going through those five points, how has the Switch 2 fared when it comes to my personal hopes for the console? Four of my five points were met to some degree of success, which I mark as a win overall. Evidently, Nintendo recognised the general areas where improvements could be made &#8211; and whilst not all of them were as emphatic an upgrade as I may have hoped, the cumulative progress makes for a significant leap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarise, I&#8217;m going to rattle back through the main points. Firstly, the eShop is much easier and faster to navigate, but could still do with more options for filters and user reviews. In addition, the console is a step up in power, and whilst it isn&#8217;t at the level of modern Microsoft and Sony consoles, games look brilliant and the hardware keeps Nintendo in the ballpark for third-party games. Speaking of which, we have received welcome news on <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, and seen the release of a new exciting Nintendo EAD game in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, and now we wait for the likes of <em>Pokémon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and other franchises to launch on the console. Sadly, Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added much in the way of system customization, but it has delivered new social options in the form of GameChat, finally bringing in-built party chat to a Nintendo console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the admitted caveats to some of the &#8220;Yes&#8221; points, I want to focus on the positives of the Switch 2. This is because, despite the iterative nature of the console, it does achieve that new-console feel. I was worried that it might feel like another specification of Switch instead of a brand new thing, but there are enough upgrades to ensure that isn&#8217;t the case. Much of this is down to the optimized power of the console, and how much snappier and responsive it is to play. But another contributing factor is the hardware itself &#8211; in handheld mode, the larger form factor and sleeker Joy-Con 2 designs feels fresh and streamlined, and the console has made playing in bed (for example) feel like a delightful high-end experience. I will say, it helps that I have massive hands, so the larger console size is more comfortable for me personally.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14952" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d like to see Nintendo continue to make software improvements to the Switch 2 &#8211; for example new eShop features, new menu Themes, and extra social hubs &#8211; but I&#8217;m left with a firmly positive impression of the console overall. I&#8217;ve been getting back into playing games more frequently recently, and I&#8217;m glad to say that the Switch 2 has been a contributing factor to that; and if I&#8217;m playing more games and having a good time doing so, that marks the Switch 2 as a success in my book!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this post!

As mentioned in that post, I was part-way through my first ever play through of <em>Diamond </em>at the time of writing. Of the two initial games (<em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>), <em>Pearl </em>was the one I got back in 2007, before then playing the third game <em>Platinum </em>when it released in 2009. I’ve kept my <em>Pearl </em>save to this day, whilst <em>Platinum </em>became the game I’d restart whenever I went back to play through Sinnoh &#8211; especially as it has extra content and various quality-of-life refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I hadn’t ever played <em>Diamond </em>until I felt compelled to buy myself a copy for £48.49 from GAME back in 2019. After all, <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>are second only to <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/07/11/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> in terms of my favourite games ever, so it’s lovely to have the complete set of three physical games. I’ve been gradually playing through <em>Diamond </em>ever since; in that aforementioned 2023 post, I noted that I’d reached the trek to Snowpoint City, roughly two-thirds of the way through the game. Since then, I&#8217;ve played a little bit more each year, finishing the villainous Team Galactic part of the main story, catching the cover Legendary Pokemon Dialga, and now preparing to tackle the Pokémon League!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-12 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14830" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14828" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14829" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14806" height="715" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve played through the Sinnoh-based <em>Pokémon</em> games, and the adventure feels a little different every time, for multiple reasons: , it might be the <em>Pokémon</em> team I choose, the approach I take, or how I’m feeling in my personal life at the time. With this being my first time playing <em>Diamond</em>, it&#8217;s felt unique once again &#8211; and as I gradually get ready to reach the end of the game (and start the postgame), I thought it’d be a nice point at which to write a journal-style post about the playthrough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, this journal approach matches my new writing method I’ve been testing, where I write a little bit every day, even if it’s just a paragraph or two. It’s helped me start posting at a more regular cadence recently, which I’ve really enjoyed, and am hoping to continue! I hope you’ll come with me on my retro-inspired ramble about my current adventuring in Sinnoh, and my plan to defeat the Pokémon League with a team that might be described as unconventional&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Shine Bright Like A&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this playthrough of <em>Diamond</em>, I decided not to create my character as “William”. I often style my avatar as myself on my first playthrough of a <em>Pokémon</em> game; but as I&#8217;ve played through Sinnoh many times before, I instead went for the approach I use on repeated playthroughs. In these situations, I like to create a new character persona, in a way that challenges my team selection, mixes up the gameplay, and allows me to add my own imaginary lore. Over the years, this has often led to me constructing a monotype team (usually Steel, my favourite type), but this time I went for a dichotomy theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14797" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14795" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The character I created is called Lucie, and I think of her as treading the line between both fiery and subdued personalities. Her starter is Chimchar, which will evolve into Infernape, one of the infamously few Fire type Pokémon in the core region of Sinnoh in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em> (the Elite Four member Flint has just two Fire types in their Fire-type team)! Two of the team slots are filled by a pair of Gastrodons (named Gianna and Gillian), a Pokémon which has two forms in Sinnoh: the pink West Sea Gastrodon, and the blue East Sea Gastrodon. By having one of each, it plays into that duality theming; I think of the pink Gastrodon as part of the &#8220;bright&#8221;, flamboyant side of the team, whilst the blue Gastrodon represents the &#8220;nocturnal&#8221;, subtler side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining the West Sea Gastrodon side of the team, we have the blazing Infernape (named Symphony), as well as Raichu (Ryland) and their electrifying moves. These Pokémon both deliver fast, strong damage: for example, Close Combat and Flare Blitz for Infernape, and Thunderbolt for Raichu. On the East Sea Gastrodon side is Noctowl (Miles), which has helpful status moves such as the sleep-inducing Hypnosis, as well as Skuntank (Skylah), which has Toxic for poisoning opponents and whittling them down. As you can probably tell, I&#8217;ve always liked to daydream up my own head canon for the characters and adventure. It helps every playthrough to feel unique, as if I&#8217;m adding extra world-building along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-14 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14793" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14791" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14787" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14788" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14790" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14789" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the team described above certainly isn&#8217;t the strongest possible for <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>&#8211; and I&#8217;m aware I&#8217;m making my life more difficult when it comes to battling the toughest trainers, such as the upcoming Elite Four and Champion Cynthia. But some of these Pokémon (especially Gastrodon, Nowtowl, and Skuntank) are Pokémon I&#8217;ve barely played with before, so I get to experience the challenge of Sinnoh in a brand new way! Mixing up the team helps every playthrough to feel fresh, and strengthens my personal connection with the team &#8211; not just now, but also when I look back on them years later, such as in a longevity app like <em>Pokémon HOME</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">A Girl&#8217;s Best Friend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;ve just finished working through Victory Road, reached the entrance to the Pokémon League, and completed the final fight against your in-game rival (on a whim, I named them Mervin). Relative to other games in the series, I&#8217;d argue that Sinnoh has the best Pokémon League &#8211; the members all have distinct personalities, and present a well-balanced challenge. The difficulty isn&#8217;t unfair, but requires you to take the League seriously; I&#8217;m currently in the phase of backtracking, training up the levels of my Pokémon, and refining the movesets, items, and strategies I&#8217;m going to approach the League with. With the team I&#8217;ve selected, it requires being very deliberate with my choices &#8211; of course, the main advantage I have is that I&#8217;m particularly familiar with the challenge that lies ahead, and can plan accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-15 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14817" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14811" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14821" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14820" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14818" height="168" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216" width="216" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14799" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sinnoh Pokémon League starts with the Bug-type trainer Aaron, who should be the easiest to defeat &#8211; Bug-types have many type weaknesses, such as to Fire and Flying, which my Infernape and Noctowl can target respectively. Next up will be Bertha and her Ground-type team, which will be a tougher test &#8211; the plethora of Ground attacks will be dangerous for Infernape and Raichu, so my two Gastrodons will be relied upon to use their Water-type moves. Noctowl has a useful immunity to Ground, and Skuntank can help out with Toxic, so my team has a decent amount of options for this battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is Flint, who as mentioned earlier, is a Fire-type trainer that curiously has three non-Fire types on their team. The two that are there &#8211; Rapidash and Infernape &#8211; should again struggle against the two Gastrodons, and then the rest of my team should be able to wear down Steelix, Drifblim, and Lopunny without too much issue. Then we&#8217;ll come to Lucian, the final member of the Elite Four, who has a Psychic-type team &#8211; and this is where Skuntank will have their turn taking centre stage, as their Dark typing makes them immune to Psychic moves. With the use of Night Slash (which has an elevated critical hit rate, boosted further by the equipped Razor Claw), Skuntank should carve through a lot of the opponents, with the help of Infernape to tackle the Steel typing of Bronzong.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-16 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14808" height="542" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721" width="721" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14810" height="548" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727" width="727" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing this plan out, it makes me fairly confident at defeating the Elite Four without too much trouble. However, players of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>know that the toughest challenge lies with Champion Cynthia and her excellent team of strong and varied Pokémon (which even includes a Gastrodon of her own)! The biggest threat is her ace Pokémon &#8211; Garchomp &#8211; which can likely take out most of my team with one hit from an Earthquake. My best options are going to be my two Gastrodons, which have strong defensive stats, and can use Blizzard and Ice Beam to hit the double Ice weakness of Garchomp. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll rely on Noctowl and Hypnosis, to give myself some more time. It&#8217;s going to be a nervy battle, but there are routes to success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">In Reflection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage of the game, where I&#8217;m backtracking and gradually training up my Pokémon, showcases some of why I adore <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>so much. In theory, this part could be tiresome, gradually grinding through the experience points needed to make my team stronger &#8211; but instead, I find it tranquil. There&#8217;s something magical about the way music, visuals, and gameplay combine in these games specifically, and I enjoy taking my time; one of the main places I&#8217;m training is Victory Road, as I can access a variety of strong wild Pokémon there. Near the entrance is a useful Pokémon Center for healing your team, and I often pause to listen to the &#8220;Pokémon League&#8221; music that plays outside it. This particular track has both &#8220;Day&#8221; and &#8220;Night&#8221; versions, and the latter is especially beautiful (you can listen below). It&#8217;s a beautifully delicate composition, and captures the feeling of being near the end of an amazing adventure, but with so much still left to enjoy, and no need to rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to this music is just one example of the catharsis I feel when playing <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, which is something I talked about back in my 2023 post. This sentiment comes from a place of both subjectivity and objectivity, as my emotional connection to these games is incredibly strong. After my older sister passed away in 2007, I spent hundreds of hours exploring Sinnoh, and I&#8217;m forever grateful to the soothing effect they had &#8211; and still have &#8211; on me. There are many positive aspects I associate with this: the meticulous sprite artwork and colour palette; the endearing Pokémon and character designs; the region full of secrets to explore; the sprawling Underground; and that amazing soundtrack, just to name a handful of reasons why I love these games so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I prepare to enter the Pokémon League, I&#8217;ve also started thinking about the postgame, which in <em>Diamond </em>includes a whole separate island northeast of Sinnoh, named the Battle Zone (see the map below). It includes the Fight Area, Resort Area, and Survival Area, plus Stark Mountain. The Fight Area includes the Battle Tower in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>, which is less extensive than the expanded Battle Frontier in <em>Platinum</em>, but still offers plenty of challenge and longevity. I love the sheer amount of space left to discover in the postgame; this island is like an extra enclosed region to explore. Currently, I&#8217;m undecided on whether I&#8217;ll dive straight into this after the Pokémon League, or take a break and come back at a later time.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14813" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I&#8217;m well acquainted with the celebratory feel of the Battle Zone island, and may well get drawn into playing it immediately! After the high of defeating the Pokémon League, it&#8217;s wonderful to realise there&#8217;s still so much left for your Pokémon and you to explore. The Battle Zone has a vacation vibe, especially as you initially take a ship to get there &#8211; and the music is also uplifting and energetic, for example Route 225, which feels like a burst of energy, complete with the iconic clapping (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQvx9STW1V0">go to 00:42 in this video</a>)! Overall, the Battle Zone has a celebratory feel, and adds a lot to the overall package of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. I&#8217;m excited for the character of Lucie to extend her adventure, and take her dual-themed team onwards and upwards!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Space and Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope with this post is that it shone a light on two things: the reasons that set this playthrough of <em>Diamond </em>apart, and more detail on why I have such a strong connection to <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. They are such special games to me personally, and for a long time, I&#8217;ve considered how to do that connection justice on this site. The 2023 post was a very cathartic one for me to write, and this post is an extension of that. It&#8217;s amazing how our personal circumstances can affect our thoughts on games (and other forms of media) &#8211; and I love hearing about these stories from other people too, as it often sparks positive discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14850" height="514" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827" width="827" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that down the line, I get to write another post about <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, talking about how the character of Lucie faced the Pokémon League, and then ventured into the postgame and Battle Zone. Down the line, I&#8217;ll likely inevitably play <em>Pokémon Platinum</em> again, and that&#8217;ll continue to be the game I go back to for replaying Sinnoh.

This is the first brand new <em>Mario Kart</em> on consoles since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> on Wii U back in 2014 (the Switch received an upgraded version, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, in 2017, which I skipped) &#8211; so at least for me personally, it&#8217;s felt a long time coming. Mixed in with the excitement of a brand new Nintendo console, it made the launch of <em>Mario Kart World</em> feel like a real event, especially when played with friends, which is where <em>Mario Kart</em> always excels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, in various different configurations: both on the TV and in handheld, in solo, local co-op, and online with a friend. Now, I&#8217;ve reached a point where I feel I can state a comprehensive opinion on the game, having experienced both the racing modes and the open world that&#8217;s a major selling point of this iteration of <em>Mario Kart</em>. My thoughts are overall very positive, but there are also some flawed aspects to the game  &#8211; but I&#8217;ll expand upon this more later on in the review. Without further ado then, let&#8217;s get into it!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Start Your Engines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it was the new-console glow, or perhaps it was that wait since <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, but launching into <em>Mario Kart World</em> for the first time felt distinctly special. The game encourages you straight into exploring the open world first; this consists of the various tracks connected by open spaces of road, field, water, desert, and more. What&#8217;s immediately remarkable about the game is just how gorgeous it looks, both in handheld but also especially when played on a 4K HDR TV &#8211; and whilst this isn&#8217;t new technology, it&#8217;s wonderful to play Nintendo games in such high fidelity via the Switch 2. The visual direction of <em>Mario Kart World</em> makes brilliant use of the new hardware, presenting a world full of vibrancy, colour, and personality &#8211; which is shown in the track designs, whether it&#8217;s the bustling Shy Guy Bazaar, the scrumptious Sky-High Sundae, or the fiery Bowser&#8217;s Castle, just to name three!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-17 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14727" height="574" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mkw_sgb_view.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14724" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14725" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_17.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The infused personality is evident in the roster of characters (complete with various different unlockable outfits). Returning are your usual suspects like Mario, Luigi, Peach, and so forth; additionally, there are plenty of newcomers, including minor enemies such as Konkdor and Cataquack, and even bit-part characters such as Dolphin and, of course, Cow! If you&#8217;ve seen any discourse about <em>Mario Kart World</em> since the initial announcement, you&#8217;ll know that the Cow and their adorable grin has captured the attention of the internet, and I&#8217;ve had a wonderful time watching the various memes and edits their inclusion has spawned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the characters have a range of changeable outfits too, which are unlocked by collecting Dash Food bags from vendors in races or the open world. It adds an extra way to differentiate the characters, ranging from punk rock biker looks to desert outfits and much more in between &#8211; and they can be combined with the plentiful different karts and bikes to create the aesthetic you&#8217;re looking for. A Photo Mode has been added in tandem with this, giving plentiful options for taking pictures that show off the world and characters as you see fit. Me being me, I&#8217;m sad that we got an Explorer outfit Toad but no actual Captain Toad&#8230; But there&#8217;s always time for that in DLC, hopefully!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14754" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A smorgasbord of Yoshi! Or Yoshis? Yoshies?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The attention to detail in both audio and graphic effects is especially apparent when you build up speed. Karts and bikes camber side-to-side when they hop and drift; tyres are spongey and visibly bounce and recoil according to the track surface; and sparks crackle off your vehicle as you drift and build up a boost, just to name a small handful of the details I&#8217;m talking about. I particularly like the tension of drifting around the sharpest corners, with the screen often tilting with you and making it extra satisfying to hit the apex. Plus, the music is noticeably exceptional, supplying a consistently energetic chorus that accentuates the gameplay &#8211; especially in the final unlockable tracks, which supply a climactic crescendo unlike any other I&#8217;ve experienced in <em>Mario Kart</em>. Overall, the whole experience is lifted by this pristine look and feel, whether it&#8217;s the relatively laid-back open world, or the competitive modes, where the palpable sense of momentum is most gripping. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a Knockout!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the &#8220;World&#8221; being a key selling point of the game, it&#8217;s still those core competitive modes that retained the tightest grip on my attention. Whilst the expected familiar selection of Grand Prix, custom VS, Battle, and Time Trial modes are all here, the game deserves credit for also introducing a brand new main mode to go alongside Grand Prix. This goes by the name of Knockout Tour, where 6 different tracks are combined together into one extra-long race. It takes advantage of the increased count of 24 racers to introduce checkpoint gates along the way, eliminating those at the back each time. Essentially, it&#8217;s a way of introducing popular battle royale-esque sensibilities into <em>Mario Kart</em>, and it creates a very fun sense of chaos &#8211; especially in local multiplayer, when your friends and you are desperately trying to stay in the race amidst the various items flying around!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14736" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A road trip across the Mushroom Kingdom! Thankfully, less traffic jams than real life</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Knockout Tours are arguably the biggest challenge awaiting completionist solo players in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It&#8217;s classic knowledge now that to get the maximum 3-star rating in Grand Prix, you need to win all four races; but in Knockout Tour, you need to be leading through every single checkpoint! This is an extremely tough task, as it necessitates not just victory, but to be consistently leading &#8211; even despite homing Red Shells, or the dreaded blue Spiny Shells that target the leader. I set myself the personal challenge of 3-starring every Knockout Tour, and it led to many failed attempts, but it was highly satisfying when I finally achieved that goal. For <em>Mario Kart</em> veterans, it&#8217;s a good addition to have a target that takes this extra level of dedication to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just mentioned the items and the chaos synonymous with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and that side of the game is just as entertaining (and frustrating) as ever before! To me, <em>Mario Kart</em> is similar to other games such as <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> because at their core, each iteration is built on the same gameplay loop, and it makes it tough to critique a new entry &#8211; on one hand, it&#8217;d be unwise to stray too far from what makes the series so immensely popular, but on the other, there has to be enough new ideas to justify a new game that still feels imaginative.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-18 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14737" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14738" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14740" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As aforementioned, the Knockout Tours are a standout way in which <em>Mario Kart World</em> achieves the latter, and some of these ideas bleed over into Grand Prix, where you don&#8217;t just drive around four tracks &#8211; instead, after the first race, the initial laps are rolling starts, as you drive across the world to the next track, road-trip style. It&#8217;s a neat way to keep the same formula but match it to the open-world aesthetic of <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and in VS there are options to play either in this mode, or with the traditional laps, catering to either preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further to this, there are tweaks to the racing itself, the most notable arguably being the new parkour/trick abilities. If you drive up onto a rail, you can grind along it and perform extra trick boosts, and you can even trick onto a wall and wall-ride along it, which opens up jaw-dropping shortcuts if you master this ability (there are plenty of astonishing clips doing the rounds online)! On top of this, drifting boosts can now be used in a straight line, and launch you off the ground slightly to help initiate some of these parkour moves. In combination, all these extra options elevate the height of the skill ceiling, and keep <em>Mario Kart World</em> engaging for those who have mastered previous entries in the series. Crucially, it does this without losing the accessibility as a go-to local multiplayer party game &#8211; the extra skills are a cherry on top for those who want to go above and beyond, but they&#8217;re not essential for winning races against the CPU.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14755" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Boo Cinema is another standout track, which applies a film filter to part of the course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Items are one of the infamous levellers of <em>Mario Kart</em>, and there have been some tweaks and additions on this front too. Your usual roster of shells, bananas, and mushrooms, and more are all here, although it&#8217;s noticeable that the raw power of items such as Bullet Bill have been slightly softened, perhaps to accommodate the new racer count of 24. Some of the notable new items include the golden Coin Shell, which leaves a trail of coins behind it, and the feather, which leaps you into the air, opening another opportunity to perform tricks, wallrides, and other shortcuts. To more literally aid more inexperienced players, there are still the helpful options for motion controls, auto-accelerate, and driving aids. Whilst these aren&#8217;t new, they&#8217;re still great to see return, and are often essential for balanced 4-player sessions that everyone can enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Give Me a Boost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As fun as <em>Mario Kart</em> can be in solo play, multiplayer is where the series has always shined brightest, and that continues to be the case for <em>World</em>. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to play with several combinations of friends, and the game has impressively accommodated their varying levels of <em>Mario Kart</em> experience each time, whether they&#8217;re a fresh newcomer or someone who&#8217;s been away from the series for a while. It&#8217;s easy to criticize the items when they&#8217;re hitting you, but they do a great job at helping those towards the back stay with the pack, and there&#8217;s still the option to use items such as shells and bananas defensively whilst in the lead.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14743" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Expect to shout at your friends &#8211; in a pleasant way, of course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Local multiplayer has consistently resulted in a brilliant time, complete with the playful shouting, cheers, and competitive back-and-forth that you hope for from <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; so I can report that it&#8217;s a success in that department! My favourite local multiplayer option is the extended custom VS modes, which have plenty of customisable options, including speed, difficulty, item frequency, and the amount of races, which go up to 32 at a time. As a big Formula 1 fan, I love to nerd out about the accumulated points and the drama of how the final standings will end up, so VS will inevitably become my most-played mode!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of online play, <em>Mario Kart World</em> doesn&#8217;t quite hit the same heights as local multiplayer, because of that lack of immediate in-person reaction &#8211; and whilst it&#8217;s admirable that Nintendo has added chat functionality, I did end up defaulting to using a Discord call instead, because of the familiarity and ease of use. The main motivation to play online is to raise your versus rating (VR), which is essentially the same system we had way back on <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>. In my opinion, it&#8217;s disappointing that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added more reasons to play online, especially in a gaming landscape where online games consistently add new modes, tournaments, and other rewards for playing consistently. The end result is that I quickly fell off of online multiplayer, and have focused mostly on solo and local multiplayer.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14753" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Driving on water supplies opportunity to perform tricks as you bounce over the waves</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, I found that the returning Battle Mode was most ideal for multiplayer &#8211; in <em>World</em>, there are two options, Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, which will be familiar to players of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. Balloon Battle gives you five balloons to protect whilst doing your best to hit opponents and earn points for removing their balloons, and Coin Runners has you searching for as many coins as you can, whilst again attempting to hit others and remove their coins (whilst avoiding them doing the same to you). I have to say, I&#8217;ve never been a huge Battle Mode fan over the years, and this version hasn&#8217;t changed that &#8211; but conversely, if you love Battle Mode, this will fill that quota well. My main disappointment is that the modes are time-based instead of score-based, as I generally prefer having that concrete target and the tension of seeing who can reach it first. Despite my criticisms, I am glad Battle Mode is back, as it offers a welcome change of pace from the racing modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Free as a Birdo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, a major differentiator for <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the inclusion of a free roam mode, where you can explore the tracks (and the spaces between them) at your leisure. There&#8217;s certainly an immediate novelty to this &#8211; I have nostalgic memories of <em>LEGO Racers 2</em>, which I played a lot on PC as a child, and included a similar experience of exploring an open world between races in a colourful, family-friendly world. My hope was that <em>Mario Kart World</em> might recapture that whimsical feeling, and supply a world with plenty of secrets and rewards, and most importantly motivation to find them. At first, <em>World </em>is successful in this; one of my earliest ventures was rocking up to the Dino Dino Jungle area, and visiting the inner laboratory/auditorium section. With precise driving and the careful use of tricks, you can make your way to the top of this area &#8211; which is thrilling the first time, but soon the realisation kicks in that there&#8217;s a lack of reason to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-19 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14746" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14747" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14745" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in free roam,<em> Mario Kart World </em>has an uncanny sense of emptiness, and it&#8217;s partly because that palpable sense of forward energy &#8211; which is so prevalent in the competitive modes &#8211; is gone, without being replaced by much else. It&#8217;s not that there isn&#8217;t anything to do in the open world &#8211; for example, there are Peach Medallions and Question Mark Panels to find, as well as P Switches that activate various challenges &#8211; but the problem is that there isn&#8217;t much motivation to track all these things down. The main rewards are stickers, which are small graphic icons you can attach next to your profile name, and feel inconsequential. More work needed to be done to make the world feel alive, and not just like a suspended state of limbo from the Grand Prix mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toads and Shy Guys milling around and making campfires are a great touch, but they&#8217;re another short-lived novelty that doesn&#8217;t add substance to the experience of navigating the open world. It&#8217;s fun to find items and complete challenges, but they&#8217;re incredibly scattered &#8211; and whilst there&#8217;s a tracker for the Question Mark Panels, there&#8217;s curiously no in-game indicator for how many Medallions or Switches are left to find (and also no statistics or records screen for other modes, either). On the other hand, something free roam does do well is increasing the level of awe the world has. You can travel a long way out into the ocean, and discover sea dragons, whales, and more, and I had a great time inspecting the scale of impressive courses such as DK Spaceport. As mentioned at the start of the review, <em>Mario Kart World</em> is a stunning game to look at and listen to, and the open world gives you more time to do just that.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14748" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>P Switch challenges often consist of time trials</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s a great shame that there&#8217;s no formal splitscreen multiplayer for the open world &#8211; there&#8217;s a partial workaround, by loading into an empty wireless mode lobby, but challenges are turned off, and it&#8217;s not at all optimal. In a game marketed on free roam, and in a series known for local multiplayer, it&#8217;s a disappointing oversight that significantly reduces the reason to play this way. I have occasionally played free roam in single-player as a laid-back secondary experience, for example when listening to a podcast or talking to friends &#8211; but it has untapped potential as a playground for friends to enjoy together, and honestly, I think this would&#8217;ve papered over many of my problems with the emptiness of the open world. Instead, more often than not, you&#8217;ll launch straight into Grand Prix, Knockout Tour, or VS, as that is where the most joyous parts of <em>Mario Kart World</em> reside.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to the end of this review, I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;ve flagged multiple issues I have with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; so I need to re-emphasize that this is a genuinely excellent <em>Mario Kart</em> game, that not only delivers the best-looking and best-sounding entry into the series, but has multiple new ideas and modes that make it feel distinct. Changeable character outfits, new trick mechanics, and especially the Knockout Tour mode supply fresh style that have made <em>World </em>my new go-to local multiplayer game, and a game I&#8217;ve spent many an enjoyable hour in by myself as well. The main disappointment has to be the free roam mode, which feels sparse and quickly struggles to retain player attention &#8211; and I really hope that in the future, Nintendo supports the game with additional content that fills out this world more. Alternatively, add Captain Toad to the playable characters, and I&#8217;ll probably be happy, haha! In all seriousness, <em>Mario Kart World</em> definitely has flaws, but the core racing experience is dazzling, and it&#8217;s a superb way to start the Switch 2 era!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

I&#8217;ve written about this in multiple posts on this site, and I&#8217;ve noticed how I&#8217;m gradually getting deeper into the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> ecosystem: starting with looking back to the anime, and then playing the online game <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and now getting more invested in learning about the current meta and competitive side of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> is a complicated game with lots to learn (and relearn) for someone like me, who hasn&#8217;t been up-to-date on the meta since I stopped playing local tournaments about a decade-and-a-half-ago. But I&#8217;m slowly learning, and I&#8217;m enjoying how it&#8217;s happening naturally, via watching various YouTube creators, playing different decks in <em>Master Duel</em>, and even constructing a real-life deck that I could conceivably return to local tournaments with. So, in this post, I&#8217;m going to talk a little more about these various aspects of the game, the deck I&#8217;m playing, and why I&#8217;m enjoying this process so much!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Getting the Fire (Kings) Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve already written about <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/12/31/why-im-giving-yu-gi-oh-master-duel-another-shot/">how I&#8217;ve gotten back into <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em></a>, but only now have I reached the point where I&#8217;m starting to understand the competitive meta. At first, I was playing relatively low-powered (by current standards) decks such as Dark Magician and Monarchs, because those cards were familiar to me. But realistically, those decks aren&#8217;t fast-paced enough to keep up nowadays, so I started testing other avenues. I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of Gravekeepers, which can sometimes work in the competitive scene, if you draw the right cards (such as Necrovalley) in order to shut off abilities from the opponent. But this wasn&#8217;t a strategy that was going to help me learn the competitive game long-term, and I found that I eventually reached a point of repetition and subsequent burnout playing the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-20 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14664" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14665" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14666" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gravekeepers brought me a decent level of success!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This brought me to the HERO cards, especially Destiny HEROs, as I have a nostalgic affinity for them. The modern HERO cards have many combo effects that special summon various powerful cards, so they were much more helpful for learning the increased modern speed of combos in a deck. But I still found the HERO cards to lack flexibility for different situations, and I again reached a point where I hit a brick wall with the deck. It felt like I had hit also hit a wall in my efforts to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> in a contemporary fashion, as I couldn&#8217;t find a deck I clicked with. So I took a bit of a break from <em>Master Duel</em>, and started looking into which decks would be viable to assemble if I was playing the physical TCG (Trading Card Game). After looking at various Structure Decks as starting points, I finally found one which made sense to test out: Fire Kings!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire Kings are a deck based around monsters that destroy themselves either on the field, in the hand, or from the deck, to then activate various effects, including summoning monsters and destroying cards on the field. In addition, they have an impressive boss monster in &#8220;Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings&#8221;, which can destroy every other monster on the field (and has a magnificent summoning animation in <em>Master Duel</em>, see below)! The fiery aesthetic of these cards is well-realised in the stunning artwork, which mixes regal distinction with blazing power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-21 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14678" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14674" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14676" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14677" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14675" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Master Duel summon animations are, in a word, awesome</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the cards are relatively accessible in the real world, with only &#8220;Fire King Courtier Ulcanix&#8221; demanding a higher price point (of about £15 a copy). Most of the main Fire King cards can be acquired in the modestly priced Fire King Structure Deck &#8211; I bought three copies of this, as well as some other products (such as the recent Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Deck, which includes reprints of staple cards such as Infinite Impermanence), to construct a real-life Fire King deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, I find it helpful to have a real deck in front of me, which I can draw test hands with to slowly understand the playstyle better (I&#8217;m hoping for a reprint of Ulcanix, so I don&#8217;t have to drop £45-ish on a playset)! The result of this process is finally finding an archetype I like, which is viable to build in both <em>Master Duel</em> and the TCG &#8211; and to top it all off, Fire Kings are competitively strong too! Whilst they aren&#8217;t currently considered a top tier deck like Maliss or Ryzeal, Fire Kings do perform well in current competitive play, even winning the YCS Birmingham event this year, piloted by Dinh-Kha Bui! This tells me that if I can improve my own skill and understanding of the deck, then Fire King can reach a high ceiling of play in both <em>Master Duel</em> and local tournaments (should I decide to go&#8230; More on that later)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14669" height="696" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>It needs some changes still, but my TCG Fire King deck is taking shape!</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m playing lots of Fire King in Ranked games on <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and with every game, every new scenario, and every mistake I make (I&#8217;m admittedly still making a lot of those), I&#8217;m learning the intricacies of the deck, how to perform the best combos, and how to make the strongest boards in combination with my Extra Deck of Link, XYZ, and Synchro Monsters. I like how Fire Kings have such a strong Fire connection, which enables them to make use of several non-Fire cards as additions to the deck. For example, a common choice for Fire Kings is &#8220;Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames&#8221;, which can revive back one of your Fire Kings alongside it when summoned. This synergy is very satisfying, and ties into the overall theme of the deck, resulting in an archetype that feels richly-designed and well-realised. I&#8217;m enjoying learning the Fire King strategies, and I hope that by my next <em>Master Duel</em> post on this site, I can report that I&#8217;ve become steadily better at piloting the deck!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Creators I Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside my own proactive efforts to become better at contemporary <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I&#8217;ve been watching several YouTube creators that are a brilliant source of both entertainment and knowledge for me. <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/">In previous posts, I&#8217;ve mentioned</a> how TGS Anime and Team APS helped me get reacquainted with classic <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, which lines up with my aforementioned play of anime decks such as Dark Magician. I still watch these channels, but I&#8217;ve added several others to my regular watchlist, including the &#8220;wonky quartet&#8221; of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGuDrveqBgD0S9nqaOPw6Q">Farfa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MBTYuGiOh">MBT</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Nyhmnim">Nyhmnim</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dzeeff">Dzeeff</a>, who consistently create great content focused primarily around <em>Master Duel</em>. Often, they add fun variables to challenge themselves, such as in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xajsij7iS98">Master Chef</a> series by MBT, or the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbldWY88--A">Storage Wars</a> series by Farfa.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Videos like this (by Joshua Schmidt) are brilliant at showcasing both the fun and skill of </em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly thanks to these channels and their collaborations, I&#8217;ve also become aware of other popular YouTubers &#8211; specifically, ones focused around high-level competitive play. These are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaSchmidtYGO">Joshua Schmidt</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jessekottonygo">Jesse Kotton</a>, who are well-known for often winning or placing highly in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> tournaments. Both of them balance speaking confidently about modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> with also making videos that are fun to watch, which is very impressive and makes them stand out. Both their channels have been helpful to me, and I also like it when they have those earlier-mentioned collaborations with channels like Farfa and MBT, as they bring a little bit of extra seriousness to those videos. Discovering this range of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> players and creators has been an unexpected extra positive side effect of getting back into the game and franchise!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">It&#8217;s Time to Duel?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;ve talked about how I&#8217;ve not just been looking at the digital version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> (with <em>Master Duel</em>), but also my physical collection of cards as well. I have a fairly large amount of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> cards, mostly from my childhood and teenage years, and further supplemented with occasional more recent purchases when something has stood out to me. Those Fire King and Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Decks have given me access to plenty of modern cards to assemble a deck with, and I also picked up products like the Duel Devastator set from 2019, which was full of guaranteed competitive staples like &#8220;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&#8221;. This is all to say that I&#8217;m nearing a place where not only am I improving at <em>Master Duel</em>, but I could conceivably go to an in-person event near me and test out my skills in person (scary, I know, haha)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14673" height="672" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Recent structure decks have been ideal for helping me build Fire Kings</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Jokes aside, there&#8217;s only a few things stopping me from doing this, and one of them is overcoming that social anxiety. I&#8217;ve become better at this over the years, but I definitely find the initial ice-breaking of heading to a new club/group quite daunting. About a year ago, I also experienced this when joining a nearby running club &#8211; there is that initial awkward stage of getting to know people and faces, but it gets easier over time. I&#8217;m confident that this wouldn&#8217;t be a long-term issue, especially as I now know a friend who has introduced me to a local store that hosts Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next barrier is more closely related to the theme of this post &#8211; and that&#8217;s a personal target to be relatively well-acquainted with the game before showing up to a local tournament again. I&#8217;m definitely nearing this stage, and part of this preparation would be making the finishing touches to my Fire King deck. I&#8217;d like to get that playset of three Fire King Courtier Ulcanix first, as they&#8217;re integral to the strength of the deck. The card is out of stock on most sites, and my best route currently seems to be waiting for a good UK price on Cardmarket. I could wait and hope for a cheaper reprint, but there is no sign of this happening at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jesse Kotton has a video about Fire Kings and their affordability</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I&#8217;d like to get a copy of some extra staple Extra Deck cards such as &#8220;S:P Little Knight&#8221;, and possibly acquire some extra non-Fire King cards that often seen play in the deck, such as &#8220;Bystial Magnamhut&#8221; and &#8220;Bystial Druisworm&#8221;. The main thing I&#8217;m keeping an eye on is price &#8211; for example, in an ideal world I&#8217;d also add competitively strong cards such as &#8220;Mulcharmy Fuwalos&#8221; to the deck, but that would cost another £70-ish for a playset, and I haven&#8217;t even gone to a local event yet (I do have a tendency for overthinking)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve still not decided if I&#8217;ll make the time to make the leap to playing the TCG in-person again, but I&#8217;m getting increasingly tempted to have a go. It would enable me to test out my skills, and it could also be a way to make new friends and connections. When I went to local events in my teenage years, I enjoyed the trading side of the game too &#8211; and who knows, perhaps that&#8217;s a better way to acquire some of these missing cards for my Fire King deck. If I do decide to go, I hope to write up about my experience on this site, however well (or badly, haha) it goes!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the third <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> centric post I&#8217;ve written over the last 8 months, and they&#8217;re good reflections of how I&#8217;ve gotten back into the franchise as a whole: not just my nostalgic connection, but how I&#8217;ve been learning about the modern game and how it&#8217;s evolved over time. I admittedly used to be someone who lamented that <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> had become too complicated and suffered from power creep &#8211; and whilst those aren&#8217;t completely untrue, I think they were oversimplifications on my part. Having now taken the time to ingrain myself back into the world of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I see that the game has developed into something new &#8211; something faster, more complex, and in some ways arguably better than before.</p>\n\n\n\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top: 75%;">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this post has explained how I&#8217;m pushing myself to get better at the game, with the conduit of a Fire King deck as my resource for playing the game at a higher skill level than before. I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn still, both about this deck and other decks, but I&#8217;m having an excellent time doing so &#8211; which is probably evidenced by me considering playing the TCG in-person again at some point in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this post, and I sincerely hope you are happy, healthy, and having a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/03/how-fire-kings-are-helping-me-learn-competitive-play-in-yu-gi-oh-master-duel/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Right then, let&#8217;s get into the post, and I hope you enjoy the read!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Edinburgh Marathon 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/">my build-up and training for the Edinburgh Marathon</a> multiple times since I started planning in November 2024, and after a train journey up to Edinburgh and a couple of days in the city, on May 25th 2025 the day finally arrived for my first marathon! My parents and some close friends were there to support me, and I also had the support of all those who contributed to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">my charity fundraiser for Beat</a> (the Eating Disorder charity). Thank you to everyone who donated or even just took a look at my Justgiving page &#8211; I&#8217;m really proud to spread awareness for a charity that means a lot to both my family and I.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14636" height="607" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So, you may be asking, how did the marathon go? It was a tough one, and Scotland threw all the elements at us. There were periods of sun, rain, strong winds, and even hail when I reached approximately mile 20! As expected, the last 10-ish miles are where the battle really begins, as much mental as physical. It was important to me that I do my absolute best and never stop or walk if I can help it, and at mile 25 I got to see my friends and family cheer me on as I neared the finish line!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was an unexpectedly dramatic finish. With the finish line in sight, and as I pushed for the line with maybe 100 metres left to go, I was struck with the notorious &#8220;jelly legs&#8221; and fell. I managed to get back to my feet with the help of another nearby runner, and made it to the line. As someone who is very critical of themselves, I was disappointed at not finishing the run in better style &#8211; and this is where my family and friends were invaluable at stopping me from being too harsh on myself. It was a great reminder of how much they care for me and how much support I had on the day, and I am incredibly grateful to them and everyone else who has congratulated me since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-22 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14624" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Early on&#8230; !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14622" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the race</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14623" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final stretch!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Including Gift Aid, we raised £1,821.77 for Beat, and I&#8217;m very proud of this, as well as the personal achievement of finishing the marathon. I&#8217;m still deciding whether or not to do another marathon &#8211; after not finishing in quite the way I hoped, I am feeling motivated to do another one, maybe the Norfolk Marathon in 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest gaming news stories over the last few months has been the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. As not only a gaming fan but also specifically a Nintendo fan, I got my console immediately, and have been playing it a significant amount since! Whilst it&#8217;s more of an iteration than a revolution in terms of hardware, I personally enjoy the larger console and screen size, as it fits my larger hands very well. The only exclusive game I have so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I&#8217;ve put many an hour into!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14620" height="534" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, <em>Mario Kart World</em> feels like the first new entry since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> many years ago, as I played a lot of the latter on Wii U and never felt the need to buy the <em>Deluxe</em> version on Switch. Therefore, <em>World</em> feels very fresh to me, and it&#8217;s also visually spectacular (especially on a big 4K HDR TV). I&#8217;ve 3-starred all the Grand Prix and am now working away at the Knockout Tours, which are battle-royale style checkpoint races new to this game. These Knockout Tours are very tough to get 3-stars on, but I&#8217;m enjoying the challenge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a few criticisms of the game &#8211; including my own biased disappointment at no inclusion of Captain Toad, haha &#8211; but also about the open-world twist on the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula. In concept, it&#8217;s a smart way to go, but I have mixed feelings on the execution, as the world feels a little empty and repetitive to explore. Despite this, I&#8217;m going to save my full thoughts, as I plan to write a dedicated review at some point soon. One thing is for sure, and that&#8217;s <em>Mario Kart World</em> being the new go-to local multiplayer game for my friends and I!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the Switch 2 itself, it does feel like an investment for the future, as outside of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and now <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> (which I hope to play soon), there&#8217;s a lack of headline exclusive titles. But for now, the hardware upgrade and promise for the future &#8211; plus the fun of <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; has made it feel worth the purchase for this Nintendo fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-text-align-left">My watching habits have been quite eclectic recently! In terms of the films, the standout has to be <em>Superman</em> &#8211; as a huge DC fan, I had high hopes for this fresh, brighter take on the iconic character, and James Gunn and company thoroughly delivered. The film is a shining beacon of positivity, fun, and creativity, and David Corenswet is a brilliant Superman to centre the new DCU around. I&#8217;m very excited to see where things go in the future, but for now I&#8217;m just so happy that we got a satisfyingly hopeful take on Superman again. I&#8217;m hoping that these vibes continue in <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> on the Marvel side, which I&#8217;m going to see tomorrow as of writing this!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-23 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14617" height="1023" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg?w=819" width="819" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14618" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg?w=691" width="691" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of TV, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to <em>The Walking Dead</em> (I really liked the recent film <em>28 Years Later</em>, and I think it&#8217;s helped put me in the zombie mood). I originally stopped watch <em>The Walking Dead</em> in Season 8, which is where a lot of people dropped off, in the war between Rick and Negan. However, I heard that it picks up afterwards, so I decided to go back, charge through Season 8, and see what I find in those last few seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst Season 8 remains a poorly-paced season, I&#8217;m glad I went back, especially because Season 9 is brilliant TV. Clearly lessons were learned from the negative reception to previous seasons, and Season 9 focuses back on character development, inventive new threats, and grounded emotional stakes. It hooked me in and I&#8217;m enjoying the ride of these last few seasons!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m already looking ahead to watching the newer <em>The Walking Dead</em> spin-offs such as <em>The Ones Who Live</em> and <em>Daryl Dixon</em>, to see where these characters end up. Other than <em>The Walking Dead</em>, I&#8217;m also slowly making my way through the latest Marvel show <em>Ironheart</em>, which hasn&#8217;t been marketed very well by Disney &#8211; which is a shame, as it&#8217;s very well-made and full of great performances.  To loop back around to <em>Superman</em> and the DCU, I&#8217;m also eagerly anticipating <em>Peacemaker</em> Season 2, which will tie into that film and the larger world!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this summation of some of what I&#8217;ve been up to recently! One of my goals for the rest of the year is to start writing here more consistently &#8211; I&#8217;ve been saying this for a while, but it&#8217;s something I really want to get back to. It&#8217;s been necessary for me to spend more time on my personal life and take breaks from writing, but in the process of that personal growth, it&#8217;s reminded me how much I like writing about the things I play, watch, and do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I often get distracted or hit writer&#8217;s block, so I&#8217;m considering the approach of setting aside a little bit of time every day to write with no background music/videos, as opposed to my previous strategy of writing in big time chunks all at once. Either way, I&#8217;m planning to be more present on here in the second half of the year, and I look forward to it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sincerely hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a wonderful day!

Many hours of my weekends have been devoted to building up my distance; I am a longtime runner, but had never ran more than a half-marathon before my marathon training this year. Last weekend I did my longest run, a 23.2-miler (my poor legs), and I&#8217;m now tapering down before the big day. My mental health has been low recently, and the marathon has been a good target for my mind to try and focus on, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14584" height="560" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025"><em>https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m both excited and nervous for the event, for which I will be journeying to Edinburgh a few days beforehand. I&#8217;m also doing the run to fundraise for <a href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/">Beat, the Eating Disorder charity</a> &#8211; this is a cause close to my heart, as my amazing sister Charlotte passed away in 2007 after battling anorexia. As aforementioned in my previous post, you can view my Justgiving page <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">at this link</a>, and any donations would be very much appreciated, but there&#8217;s no pressure at all to donate!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Upcoming Book Projects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a designer for Titan Books, I get to work on some really exciting projects, and honestly that fulfilment in my work means a lot to me &#8211; it&#8217;s very rewarding to have a physical product of your work, especially when it&#8217;s related to a property (such as Marvel or <em>Star Trek</em>) that you enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get to experience working on several exciting film retrospectives, and some upcoming ones from Titan include books on <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>,<em> </em>The Crow films, and <em>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</em>, which you can see covers for below!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-24 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14562" height="904" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706" width="706" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14564" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800" width="800" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14563" height="927" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of fiction, the final Mike Hammer novel <em>Baby, It&#8217;s Murder</em> released recently, and there are upcoming Marvel paperbacks for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Annihilation</em> and <em>Doctor Strange: Dimension Wa</em>r.

I&#8217;m very impressed by what was shown, and have my pre-order in for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. Whilst I like physical media, I can&#8217;t justify that high £74.99 price point for buying <em>Mario Kart</em> separately. Those game prices are the main criticism so far &#8211; the only other hesitation is seeing Nintendo choose surety over innovation in terms of hardware. I&#8217;m confident the Switch 2 will be a huge hit, but I do slightly miss those eclectic reveals of the Wii U, 3DS, Wii, DS, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what I&#8217;m playing, I&#8217;ve been struggling with burnout and game-playing-motivation recently, so haven&#8217;t played much. I have however briefly gotten back into<em> Bravely Default</em> on the DS (which ironically has a Switch 2 version coming soon), and continue to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel </em>now and then. I&#8217;m hoping my game-playing motivation returns soon, but am also not putting too much pressure on myself, as I don&#8217;t want to force it. I look forward to the Switch 2 hopefully reigniting that fire a bit &#8211; oh, and please add Captain Toad to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, Nintendo! It would make me very happy indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve admittedly struggled to get back into games recently &#8211; but when it comes to TV, I&#8217;ve been keeping more up-to-date, and there&#8217;s a lot that I&#8217;ve been liking recently! The second season of <em>Andor </em>and second (or fifteenth, depending on how you count) season of <em>Doctor Who</em> are currently airing, and both are fantastic. <em>Andor </em>continues the engrossing drama and brilliantly tangible visual design of the first season, and this era of <em>Doctor Who</em> is really hitting a stride, with unexpected surprises amidst the brilliantly imaginative stories. I really hope the rumours of <em>Doctor Who</em> taking a break after this season are false, as Ncuti Gatwa is sensational, portraying a charismatic and emotionally healed Doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also just finished watching through <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Netflix-verse of Marvel TV (especially<em> Jessica Jones</em>), so to see some of those characters returning has been wonderful. The series feels like both a reinvention and a continuation of the original three <em>Daredevil </em>seasons, and I&#8217;ve been thrilled by how well it has turned out. The character work, cinematography, and courtroom/political intrigue is all here, and I am stoked for Season 2 &#8211; I just hope some of the Defenders do turn up in Season 2, including not just Jessica Jones, but Luke Cage and Iron Fist too!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a quick rundown on what I&#8217;ve been doing, playing, and watching! I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this quick update &#8211; I think of this site like my own digital journal, so even when I take a break, I always like to come back with some sort of update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really hope you are happy and healthy, and that you are having a wonderful week. See you next time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mikehammer_babyitsmurder_fc.jpg?w=666', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/81tvyzi3mvl._sl1500_.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doctorstrange_dimensionwar_salescover-1.jpg?w=678', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/godzillamovienovelization_omnibus_salescvr_dec24.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}]}

With such an expansive and imaginative open world, it&#8217;s a double-edged sword when it comes to DLC; on one hand, you know people like this world, but on the other, you really have to make the expansion stand out from that world to set it apart. For <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, this is done with a new area named The Cut, full of cold weather, dangerous new machines such as the Scorcher, and intriguing story reveals that bridge the gap between <em>Zero Dawn</em> and the sequel <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/03/30/horizon-forbidden-west-review/">Forbidden West</a></em> (incidentally, the only reason I haven&#8217;t included the <em>Forbidden West</em> DLC on this list is because I don&#8217;t have a PS5 to play it on)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cut is full of activities for main character Aloy, whether it be exploration, narrative, or combat &#8211; including optional super-hard combat trials for the real masochists among us. The local tribe (named the Banuk) tie into the aforementioned overarching story, and as Aloy discovers literal machinations under the snow-covered surface of The Cut, it increased my anticipation around where the sequel will go next &#8211; which is surely a sign of a successful DLC. When I wrote <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/02/14/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds-review/">my review for <em>The Frozen Wilds</em></a> back in 2018, I also noted how it made small steps to improve dialogue animations (which were sometimes quite static in the main game), and you can see how that was continued to full fruition in the dynamic conversations of <em>Forbidden West</em>. Not only is <em>The Frozen Wilds</em> substantial and utterly beautiful to look at, but it actively improves the gameplay foundation of a series I adore.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Mass Effect 3: Leviathan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious choices when it comes to <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC are the fantastic <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> for <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, or the <em>Citadel </em>DLC that served as an epilogue for <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. However, the expansion I have the strongest personal connection to is <em>Leviathan</em>, the first of the <em>Mass Effect 3</em> DLCs. I only bought an Xbox 360 shortly before <em>Mass Effect 3</em> launched, and that game was my gateway into the series (I went back and played the entire trilogy afterwards). After mainly playing on Nintendo consoles beforehand, the concept of single-player expansions was relatively foreign to me &#8211; but after being so enraptured by <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, I was incredibly excited at the prospect of more story content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ending of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is infamous for being disappointing to many people &#8211; but in a way, it made me more excited for DLC that would further flesh out the backstory of the giant world-destroying Reapers that you face throughout the trilogy. <em>Leviathan </em>is all about the discovery of a secret race named (you guessed it) Leviathans, who predate even the mysterious Reapers. In the DLC, you journey across space to piece together morsels of information about their origins. I particularly like the planet 2181 Despoina, a planet covered in water and full of secrets and intense combat situations. That sense of discovering places that were meant to be hidden forever is thrilling, especially when you get to the climactic moments that reveal how the Leviathans play into the wider battle against the Reapers &#8211; and it&#8217;s that rush of energy that makes <em>Leviathan </em>stand out as my favourite <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker &#8211; Special Episode</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very happy when <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> got a Switch release, as it allowed even more people to play this gem of a game &#8211; and I was even happier when in early 2019, a new selection of levels was added with the <em>Special Episode</em> expansion! Whilst this isn&#8217;t a large single-player story expansion like some of the other games I&#8217;ve included in this list, I wanted to highlight this DLC for <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, as it&#8217;s a joyful addition with plenty of value for money (currently £5.39 on Switch). Also, yes, I&#8217;m biased for Captain Toad, but that&#8217;s besides the point, aha&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who haven&#8217;t played <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, it&#8217;s a delightful puzzle game that sees Captain Toad and Toadette make their way through levels based on Hakoniwa Japanese box gardens, with the player rotating and shifting the levels around in order to progress. The <em>Special Episode</em> adds 5 brand new levels and 13 challenges that reinvent previous courses, so 18 new levels to play through in total. As with the main game, there&#8217;s a lovely variety, from haunted caves full of Boos, to a treacherous ship, to another minecart ride! As <em>Treasure Tracker</em> is presented in several book chapters, the DLC additions fit in smoothly, and I&#8217;d frankly happily play as many levels as Nintendo is happy to add (I really hope we get a sequel one day)! The <em>Special Episode</em> is a wonderful and endearing addition to <em>Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Dragon Age: Inquisition &#8211; Trespasser</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a brilliant time with all of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> DLCs, but it&#8217;s the final DLC <em>Trespasser </em>that&#8217;s my favourite of the bunch. Requiring story completion to play, it&#8217;s a definitive end &#8211; and cliffhanger &#8211; to <em>Inquisition</em>, even preventing you from returning to the main game afterwards. The plot brings the player to a summit assembled to decide what happens to the Inquisition now that the main threat has been ended, but soon a new conspiracy is discovered. This eventually reveals that Solas (an eleven mage who&#8217;s a consistent presence in the <em>Dragon Age</em> series) is secretly Fen&#8217;Harel and the Dread Wolf. He&#8217;s been responsible for many of the magical occurrences that have played a part in the game, and he&#8217;s now seeking to collapse the Veil that separates worlds, despite the catastrophic consequences it&#8217;d cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For players who&#8217;ve spent many hours around this character who they thought was on their side, it&#8217;s a dramatic reveal that created a lot of excitement for the sequel to <em>Inquisition</em>. Solas even cuts off the arm of the main character to prevent them stopping him, before disappearing and leaving the player with the decision of whether the Inquisition should be continued or disbanded. <em>Trespasser </em>does have competent combat elements too, but the story is the focus here, and it&#8217;s always been memorable thanks to the anticipation it created for the sequel. However, despite <em>Trespasser </em>releasing in 2015, we only got <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/08/04/dragon-age-the-veilguard-why-im-optimistic-what-id-like-to-see-next/">The Veilguard</a></em> at the end of 2024, so it did leave a lot of time for players to stew and theorize!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Resident Evil 5: Lost in Nightmares/Desperate Escape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I first played <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/02/resident-evil-5-review/">Resident Evil 5</a></em> in 2020, and I did so on PS4, where both the DLC expansions <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> and <em>Desperate Escape</em> are bundled in with the main game, so I&#8217;m going to include them both together for the purposes of this list. Whilst <em>Resident Evil 5</em> certainly has flaws, it also has a lot to praise, such as how it leans into cinematic storytelling. The two DLCs act as a prequel and an in-between-quel, and give an opportunity to play as series mainstay (and <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/23/my-5-favourite-video-game-characters/">my favourite <em>Resident Evil</em> character</a>) Jill Valentine, as well as the pilot Josh Stone. Firstly, <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> is set before <em>Resident Evil 5</em>, and shows Jill and Chris Redfield infiltrating the Spencer estate to confront Albert Wesker. We see snippets of this encounter &#8211; which leaves Jill presumed dead &#8211; during the main game as flashbacks, but here we get to play through it all: puzzles, combat, and Wesker boss fight included. Jill and Chris are the quintessential <em>Resident Evil</em> partners, so it&#8217;s comforting to see them interact (well, as comforting as it can be when facing down monstrosities).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Desperate Escape</em> is set towards the end of the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> campaign, just after Sheva Alomar and Chris manage to free Jill from the mind control of Wesker. Whilst the former pair go after Wesker in the main game, we never got to see how Jill and Josh made their own way out, and we get to play that out for ourselves here. This is arguably the tougher DLC of the two, less puzzle-focused and more about, well, desperately escaping &#8211; ending with a horde-assault sequence that gets frenetic on the higher difficulties. Both DLCs are great for different reasons, and as a combo add a lot to the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> story experience. Jill getting her time to shine is great too, especially as she wasn&#8217;t playable in the main game. This is timeline-wise the last time we got to play as Jill in the main story, too &#8211; please take the hint, Capcom&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The Last of Us: Left Behind</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You knew this had to be on here, right? In my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> rose the bar for story expansions, just like <em>The Last of Us</em> rose the bar for narrative video games. <em>Left Behind</em> fits into the later portions of <em>The Last of Us</em>, after Joel is near-fatally injured, and Ellie is hunting for medical supplies in an abandoned mall. This forms part of Left Behind, but it&#8217;s also interspersed with flashbacks to three weeks before the main game, where Ellie is taken by her friend Riley to break into another abandoned mall in Boston &#8211; and this is where the DLC shines at its brightest. As with many of the other expansions in my list, the core gameplay is a solid continuation of the main game, but it&#8217;s the story advancements and believable character interactions which leave the strongest impact here, giving us brand new information on Elie and her backstory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the best parts of the DLC aren&#8217;t fighting infected, but instead when Riley and Ellie are exploring the desolate mall. They find carousels, video games, and plenty more to play with and talk about. The in-gameplay dialogue that <em>The Last of Us</em> uses so well is continued here, resulting in a moment between the two girls that is both natural and surprising, especially for blockbuster games at the time. It&#8217;s all interwoven with that bittersweet sense that something bad is going to happen &#8211; after all, this is an apocalyptic world, we didn&#8217;t hear much about Riley in the main game, and we know Ellie gets bitten at some point. Those moments do come, but they maintain all their dramatic impact because of the masterful way Naughty Dog combines gameplay and narrative (and also because of brilliant performances by Yaani King as Riley and Ashley Johnson as Ellie). As I said at the start &#8211; in my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> raised the bar for story expansions, and it&#8217;s still one of my favourites to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>With that, we come to the end of the list! As mentioned earlier, there are plenty other great DLC expansions out there, but these are six of my own favourites, each for their own specific reasons.

Therefore, I thought I&#8217;d give a quick overview of what&#8217;s been added to the game and why I&#8217;ve found it so rewarding!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Look to the Skies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s immediately obvious which archetype Konami is pushing with this event &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the Sky Strikers, who were introduced back in 2018 and have become incredibly popular since. The first two <em>Master Duel </em>anniversaries tied into Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so it&#8217;s admittedly a shame we don&#8217;t have a Red-Eyes Black Dragon event to round out the central three <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> Duel Monsters characters of Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey &#8211; but I suppose the power of the fan-favourite Sky Striker characters Raye and Roze was just too strong!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14502" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14515" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14519" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png" width="2560" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop is filled with new items featuring board backgrounds, player mates, card backs, a deck box, and more focused around the Sky Strikers, plus admittedly stunning alternate arts for the main Sky Striker cards. I&#8217;m not an expert on the archetype, but all the amazing artwork and shiny bonuses definitely has me intrigued to learn more about the characters!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of&#8230; The new solo Story is unsurprisingly focused around the Sky Strikers. However, what makes this even more special is the addition of animated sequences within the Sky Striker story, which have been taken from the upcoming anime <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME: THE CHRONICLES</em>. For those who don&#8217;t know, Konami recently announced that this anime will be starting in April 2025, and will be focused on the actual card lore itself. So, instead of revolving around duels (like <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em>, <em>5D&#8217;s</em>, or <em>Arc-V</em> did, for example), <em>CHRONICLES </em>will be set within the world of the cards, which is very exciting! It&#8217;s been announced that these episodes will include the archetypes Fall of Albaz, Dogmatika Ecclesia, and yes &#8211; Sky Strikers!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14505" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14507" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14508" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing small clips of the anime in the <em>Master Duel</em> solo mode was unexpected, and acts as a lovely tease of what&#8217;s to come. The animation is vibrant and expressive, and it&#8217;s great to see this willingness to expand on the card lore &#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely be checking these anime episodes out as they release. Also I have to mention that the new UI for the solo mode is much improved and more player-friendly, segmenting the various solo stories up in a cleaner way, which I appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Festival Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next major addition to <em>Master Duel</em> is the two Festivals that are happening this month &#8211; the first one, Legend Anthology, features a custom banlist that excludes common staples, such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. In theory, this shakes up the meta within the mode, especially with three pre-made decks ready for players to use. However, this mode is dominated by the new Exodia deck and cards, in particular The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate, which can reach upwards of 10000 ATK and can also negates card effects. Often, the match is decided on the coin flip, as if a player goes first and gets out this Exodia card, it&#8217;s extremely hard to the opponent to stage a comeback. Still, the mode has plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, so it&#8217;s worth grinding through.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14511" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14510" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14509" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m much more excited for the upcoming Fusion X Synchro Festival (starting 17th February), which will restrict the Extra Deck to only Synchro/Fusion monsters, and cut out all the options that Link and XYZ monsters have added. I&#8217;m growing to respect those newer card types more over time, but it&#8217;ll still be fun to play some games that make players revert to pre-XYZ strategies. Hopefully it&#8217;ll allow some of my older classic decks to be a bit more viable (at least briefly)! Just like the Legend Anthology, there are plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, which should make it worth the playtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Plenty of Prizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that has always pleasantly surprised me about <em>Master Duel</em> is how generous it is as a Free-to-Play game. The 3rd Anniversary is timed with the start of a new Duel Pass, which is a 700-Gem purchase that &#8211; if you complete it &#8211; earns you all your Gems back, as well as cosmetic and in-game currency rewards, such as a background themed around the aforementioned Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate. If I had to suggest improvements, it would be for a few more unique cosmetic rewards in the Pass &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to complain too much about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the Sky Striker items I mentioned earlier, the shop also has a new Structure Deck full of the expensive HERO cards, new Selection Packs that include those new Exodia cards, as well as another chance to buy previous Anniversary-exclusive items themed around Blue-Eyes White Dragon. As someone who took a long break from <em>Master Duel</em>, I appreciate this a lot, and am slowly working my way through acquiring these.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14517" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14512" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14514" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The deck that&#8217;s currently giving me the most success is my anti-meta Gravekeeper deck, which I&#8217;ve fine-tuned to include more drawing cards and be more reliable (see the decklist image above). I&#8217;ve also finally put together my Destiny HERO deck, which is more meta, and features more Extra Deck combo cards. For long-term success in <em>Master Duel</em>, I need to learn more of these combo plays (and how to combat other combo decks), so I don&#8217;t want to stick with anti-meta decks like Gravekeepers for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my quick summation of the new <em>Master Duel</em> features and how they&#8217;ve positively affected the game &#8211; I&#8217;m really enjoying the amount to do right now, as well as the continued support Konami is bringing. I&#8217;m still slowly re-acclimatising myself to <em>Master Duel</em> after such a long time away, but I&#8217;m continuing to enjoy it and play a few duels every day. If anyone else is intrigued in giving the game a shot, I&#8217;d say now is an ideal time to jump on board, as the game is offering many player-friendly rewards that not only play on nostalgia for <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, but also relate to future projects like the <em>CHRONICLES </em>anime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this quick article &#8211; and if you&#8217;re playing <em>Master Duel</em>, let me know how you&#8217;re finding it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}]}
