You no longer battle 3 pets in the open world and attempt to cage, instead you just.. throw a cage, and catch it. The new method removes pet battles from the equation &#8211; at least for Midnight. This is NOT retroactive to other zones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who really enjoys pet battling, and who enjoys capturing pets, this troubles me. I&#8217;m concerned that Blizzard is going to slowly phase out pet battles all together. I&#8217;m concerned that they&#8217;re done with one of the only aspects of the game I interact with on an almost daily basis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comments (of course) there is a LOT of speculation, comments like it&#8217;s because of Nintendo. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;d go that far, we&#8217;ve seen pets move to the very end of the line in a number of expansions now and I&#8217;m just worried that this will be one more system that they cut out completely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thoughts?

Last night was our usual Guild Wars 2 shenanigans night and we spent most of it running random fractals through the new quick play system.  Of our group, I am the only one who has completed all of the steps required to get legendary gloves and finish the 500 dust achievement that gives you 2 bags, 2 bag slots, and a random legendary. I have no clue how many we ran, but we did have a few weird things happen.  There was one time when the quickplay system split our party and sent two of us to one fractal with three randoms, and the other two to another fractal with three randoms.  It took us a bit to realize this, because we were talking about different fractals with me and Sol ending up in Kinfall, and Sita and Ammo ending up in the Volcano.  When I referred to the boss as a bullet sponge Ammo and Sita were a bit confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29958" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Diablo_IV-20251003-062859200.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Over lunch I wrapped up the remaining achievements in Champion and have officially moved on to Destroyer.  Most of these require me to be wearing Chaos gear&#8230; which GREATLY nerfs my damage and survivability.  I am still trying to figure out a build I can go with that does not adversely harm my build so I can start knocking these out.  I did run around long enough in a Helltide to open 10 tortured gifts and finish that sub achievement, which is always a bit of a pain in the ass. There are other hateful achievements like finish 5 events with mastery in 20 mins&#8230;  or kill 200 mobs after triggering the spawning of a Harbinger but before it shows up. I am not entirely certain I am finishing Destroyer in this season, because without Ace playing with me&#8230;  I&#8217;ve lost a lot of my forward momentum to actually knock this out.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29954" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251003-072230344.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Over in Destiny Rising I am dealing with a bit of a logjam as I need to get Silver Medals on three characters in order to progress to the next steps of Ascension.  The power grind is of course a big problem for each character, but the bigger one for me is the Legendary Campaign completion.  This has been an activity that I have been largely ignoring, because the first one I ever did was the current sniper one&#8230;  and hated every minute of it.  There are a few things that I detest in games&#8230; the big one is being on a timer.  I have deep seated problems with being timed while doing something&#8230;  and it dates back to elementary school trauma.  I also hate the Shinkas in general and having to fight the sniper ones&#8230;  was just a pain in the ass and as such I have avoided these completely.  Unfortunately this means that I have had zero under 7 minute completions of this event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29956" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251003-065834866.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This morning I knocked out a completion on Umeko, which means I only need to get her light up in order to get a silver medal.  I should probably also borrow a Tan-2 and an Attal and complete all of the ones available this week so that I don&#8217;t have to wait multiple weeks for the sniper one to come around again.  I will probably give Jolder a try, but I am not sure how she is going to kill the sniper Shinka without killing herself in the process.  Maybe because I tend to run with a full bar of overshield, I will be able to soak the damage and survive anyways.  However I think I am probably just going to have to wait for another week where Jolder is the suggested champion.  These rotate through every week and in theory Jolders should be coming up next.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29961" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251002-181845144.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that I had what was quite possibly my fastest clear of one of the raid phases, which rewarded me another copy of the Exotic crossbow that Ning Fei uses.  This one thankfully was already level 80, so I was able to just swap over to it immediately.  One of the things that you can do in this game is spend some glimmer&#8230; which is mostly useless&#8230; and reset a champion reclaiming all of the materials that you have spent on them.  I think I might do this for a few champions in order to hopefully push the light levels up on the ones that I am trying to push up to silver.  I am not sure if this will matter at all, because it is higher end materials that I am currently jammed up on, not low level materials.  However it still might be worth a shot.  Especially for the ones where I have completed their main story quest&#8230; I no longer really care about having them up at higher light levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this though is going to get sidelined a bit because I bought a stupidly large TV yesterday, and tonight I plan to tear apart the living room and set everything up slightly differently with the new television.  This has been something I have wanted for awhile, and the entire reason why we swapped entertainment centers back in June.  I figured while my wife is no longer with us&#8230;.  I should probably finish up this plan we had for awhile.  However I think I probably want to also explore curtains to hang over the circle window so that I can block some more light for optimal movie viewing and gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/03/splitting-the-party/">Splitting the Party</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/03/splitting-the-party/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '29953'}

Yesterday we got some<a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/raids-and-strike-missions-in-2026/"> great news from Guild Wars 2</a> that the quick play feature that has been a rousing success during the Fractal Incursion event would be coming for the new combined raid system.  Essentially they are taking strikes and raid wings and merging them into a new feature, and then adding quick play functionality for the easier wings and strikes.  I am so unbelievably pumped about this, and right now the Guild Wars 2 is on fire with their quality of life improvements.  I am just hoping that when the Fractal Incursion event is over in a few days&#8230; that we get some version of the quick play feature permanently for Fractals at least.  The raid finder tool will not be coming until the first post expansion update, which should land sometime first quarter of 2026 if the pacing of content drops are similar to how they were with Janthir Wilds.  I am honestly super pumped about the <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/en-us/visions-of-eternity#standard">Visions of Eternity expansion drop</a> in general coming at the end of this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29951" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/XboxPriceHike.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In less great news&#8230; Microsoft continues down a path of self destruction following their recent massive price hikes on their consoles with a price hike to Gamepass.  Ultimate was previously $19.99 and it is bumping up to $29.99 a month&#8230;. which at least for me is a bridge too far.  I have been a subscriber since Gamepass first came into existence, and have been using it to play various Microsoft stable PC games as they released.  However I think I am just going to hard pass on this system even though I did enjoy the Cloud gaming functionality. Immediately following this news I saw reports on social media that the cancellation page was effectively bricked for most of the day as there was a flood of cancellations.  It was still a bit wonky last night as I attempted to cancel it.. hanging for over a minute on the final step before finally resolving into a page that allowed me to enter my reasoning. Microsoft has talked at length about them wanting to grow Gamepass, but this is absolutely not the way to do it. With this and many other things&#8230; I think we have finally reached the point where we frogs noticed that the water was boiling and are ready to hop out of the pot.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29944" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Diablo_IV-20251002-065922693.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I got a message over on Bluesky from my friend Delebrin that the time played in Diablo IV is located on the character profile page at the bottom.  This sounds like something that I once knew, but have long since forgotten.  I am grateful that they pointed it out however, and my estimate of being around 40 hours into this character was pretty accurate with me having actually played 36. Now I am trying to figure out what I want to do next.  This is ultimately the point I end up with in Diablo III and Diablo IV each time I play through a season.  None of the content is compelling enough to really keep me diving into it for the sake of doing it&#8230;  and the gap in RNG drops between Ancestral Uniques and Mythics is so wide that I am just not sure it is worth the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29943" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Diablo_IV-20251002-065952331.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am close to wrapping up Champion in the season journey, and this honestly has traditionally been my guiding light for when I consider myself done with a season.  The final phase is going to be a bit harder as I said in an earlier post, because many of those accomplishments require you to be wearing some piece of chaos gear, and I am not sure what I can actually sacrifice in order to make that happen.  I did not get a ton of time to play last night, because I instead hung out with Ace and played Destiny Rising.  However today at lunch I should be able to finish up the rest of the stuff on Champion and then begin chipping away at the last rank.  I did finish leveling the seasonal event tree and got my mythic shard, and I have a few more steps on the battle pass&#8230; so essentially when I wrap all of this up I will probably consider the game &#8220;beaten&#8221; for the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29948" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251001-181458863.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a new month and with that comes a reset on some of the currency exchange shops, allowing me to pick up some more normal banner pulls, and I managed to finally pull Ning Fei, the last of the champions that I did not have.  I am still only a few pulls away from getting the Mythic Choice champion so I am not sure if I hold onto this for future use if that is even allowed, or if I pick up a second copy of Jolder.  She is by far my favorite of the normal banner mythic champions, though from everything I have heard Ning Fei seems to be pretty awesome.  I did pick up two copies of Xuan Wei while spending down my normal banner pulls, but I am just not really playing him that often.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29949" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251001-181434498.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I did pull a really sweet exotic ghost shell called the Cryptex, so that was pretty fun.  Most of the night was spent running Morgran&#8217;s Hunt because that event ends I believe today. We also did a few rounds of our all Ikora PvPvE nonsense&#8230;  and honestly&#8230;  we are getting better at this.  We had one match where we took out six or seven players, along with a few clutch kills&#8230;  but didn&#8217;t really score terribly well in general. Ace and I were talking last night about how much better of a Destiny experience this game is, and how they had never really gotten into baseline Destiny as much as this version.  I think in some aspect it is the multiple characters, because you can do a bunch of different things, rather than feeling like you are forced to play one of three characters.  Grinding up light in Destiny feels like it was way harder than grinding up gear in Destiny Rising, so I think that is at least part of it for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29947" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251001-192202946.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a bit stalled in my progression, because I essentially need to complete all of the silver achievements on three characters so I can remove the logjam that is my ascension score.  Right now in most cases I am gated by my total light score for the characters and not having an easy way to bump that up, and also needing to run 7 minute legendary events, which are single player versions of missions in the game.  I do not really enjoy these, so it is something I am going to have to force myself to get good at.  The current one sort of sucks because it is all sniper based, and while I have leveled Umeko and Tan-2 a bit&#8230;  neither feels like they are good enough to rip through this mission quickly.  I thought I had gotten it last night but seemingly there is a lag between when you finish the final boss and when it shuts off the timer.  I took a death in the middle, and if I had not done that I would have probably been able to finish that one without much issue.  However I am going to have to wait for another week because I do not think there is any way I am getting non-snipers through this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyways! I think that is all of the assorted nonsense I have in my head this morning.  I hope your week is going well.

I am still struggling a bit with this respiratory crud, but am doing better enough to be able to function and actually work today. If it drags on, I will end up going to the doctor but given that I doubt there is anything that they can do other than put me on a dose pack of prednisone&#8230; which will royally fuck with my sleep patterns&#8230; I have been trying to avoid that.  I mostly spent the night playing Diablo IV downstairs while snuggling with cats.  Gracie was doing the thing in my office where she refused to not be the center of attention, and when this happens it is generally better if I go down to the couch where she can snuggle in my arms while I am playing, rather than me trying to hold her with one hand while using the computer with other other. In wild news&#8230; the last few mornings I have been able to pet the super skittish feral black cat that hangs out in front of the house with Greybie.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29939" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/D4-S10-GearFinally.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Last night I managed to finally have some luck with the trade channel and picked up a set of Ancestral Tibault&#8217;s Will for 30 million gold.  That seems like a nonsensical number, but I had over 200 million and nothing really to do with it&#8230; so it effectively has no value to me.  I opted to throw on a non-Ancestral copy of Vasily&#8217;s Prayer which at least allowed me to have the fully functional build, and this more or less has allowed me to bump up to Torment IV and farm the world content comfortably.  Just before sitting down to write this blog post I ran Varshan again and finally got an Ancestral version of that helmet to drop, so in theory I have Ancestral of better of everything that is required for the build.  I still cannot quite do bosses on T4&#8230; but they melt on T3.  Now it is just a matter of getting better versions of all of the uniques and maybe hopefully getting a few mythics so I can bump up to that version of the build. I am also hunting for a better pair of boots with more movement speed on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29936" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Diablo_IV-20251001-071930273.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest challenge that I am going to face right now is that most of the final set of challenges involve running content on t4 while having a piece of Chaos Armor equipped.  I am not really certain which slot I can theoretically sacrifice to the achievement gods in order to make that happen, but I will do some testing.  I need to run a few more Infernal Hordes to do the chaos rifts inside of them and also farm some T3 or higher Helltide in order to finish out the next to the last step in the seasons journey.  I am on the very last step of the Reign of Chaos quest chain, and I am working on the last section of the Battle Pass.  In theory within the next week I will have milked every last bit of this season that I really need to, and be able to walk away happily knowing that I pretty much did everything I could do.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29937" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PathOfExileSteam-20251001-062743731.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In other news, <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3862213">0.3.1 dropped in Path of Exile II</a>, and with it comes the significant rework of the endgame and removal of towers as the primary means of adding content to maps. I ran a few maps as a test and for the most part they seem way less rippy than they were previously.  I am still largely running t14 content and it seemed pretty easy overall.  I have not played for about a month now, so who knows what other previous patches could have added to this feeling.  It seems like maybe they have not removed ALL of the content that they intended to remove because it seems like Expeditions are still showing up as icons on the map, whereas I thought ALL additional content would be added by the Tablets instead.  Additionally it seems like the whole corruption thing stays on the atlas, which makes sense given that is how you unlock most of your atlas passives.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29938" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PathOfExileSteam-20251001-063307459.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the overall density and rippyness of the map was lowered, it did not necessarily feel like the rewards were lowered as a result.  I ran a few maps and pulled quite a bit of currency and what felt like more uniques than normal from them.  Granted two of them came from a Rogue Exile, but I walked out of the map with five uniques which seems pretty solid for a 4 mod t14 map. I am not really sure if I am going to dip my toes back into the game at this point, because once I unattach from a League in Path of Exile, it sort of feels hard to get back into the swing of things.  My mind has adjusted to Diablo IV at this point and I am probably going to ride that into the ground, or at least until I give Legion Remix a shot next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think yesterday I might have just been in a low point, so apologies for whining about life on the blog.  I put together a shelving unit which felt like significant progress so that probably cheered me up a bit.  I am feeling better about my existence in the world today&#8230; even though the country seems to be burning around me.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/01/thirty-million-gold/">Thirty Million Gold</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/01/thirty-million-gold/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '29934'}

I think it is largely allergies because we are in Ragweed season&#8230; and it is by far my worst allergy.  I also kicked up a bunch of dust last week in the garage and think I am paying for it.  I am struggling a bit right now and find myself in a bit of a funk where nothing seems to &#8220;fit right&#8221;.  I am certain I am dealing with a depression, because how could I not after losing my spouse earlier this year.  There is likely no way I got out of that without mental and emotional baggage that I am dealing with pretty regularly.  My emotions feel like a scalded tongue&#8230; that I cant quite taste things in the way that I used to before. Joy is hard to find&#8230; and I keep wandering back and forth between things without much luck.  The other day Tipa commented &#8220;I don’t know how you fit so much into your day!&#8221; and the secret is&#8230;  I keep bouncing around like mad between a dozen different things and never really making much traction in any of them. I also have no other human to suggest that I do something other than desperately look for something to kill the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29929" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250930-095611564.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am still popping into Destiny Rising each day to play some of the various daily activities, but this is honestly a game that I find myself enjoying the most when Ace and I happen to connect with our schedules at the same time.  I am doing the thing that is very familiar in Gacha games where I am trying not to spend any currency and bank it up, so that when the next character banner drops I can immediately purchase a bunch of pulls for it.  I am 16 away from the five star choice on the default banner, and whenever I hit that, I am likely going to choose Ning Fei so I have an Arc Champion that is actually pretty decent. Mostly I am chipping away at various lore tasks from different champions and forcing myself to do the planetary dailies on Ikora just to get them done.  I think my favorites are still Jolder and Estela right now&#8230; with Gwynn and Umeko being close in the running.  Wolf has sadly been relegated to the sidelines, and I actually started playing some Tan-2 to get used to the way that he plays a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29930" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250929-191445063.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In Diablo 4 I have officially respecced to the proper endgame build, but am still lacking some of the components. It gave me a bit of survival so that Torment III is now as comfortable as Torment II was previously.  Bossing on T3 is still a bit of a crapshoot and depends upon the type of damage that a given boss is dealing.  My resistances are still complete crap, and I should probably work on that. The biggest challenge that I am having at the moment is that everything I am doing&#8230; feels like a complete waste of time. I need two things&#8230; an <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/wiki/vasilys-prayer">Ancestral Vasily&#8217;s Prayer</a>, and an Ancestral Tibault&#8217;s Will. The first comes specifically from <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/resources/boss-loot-table-cheat-sheet#echo-of-varshan-header">Echo of Varshan</a> which means I need to be running Whisper caches to get keys for that. The second is a general drop unique and can come specifically from anywhere&#8230;  but specifically is apparently on <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/resources/boss-loot-table-cheat-sheet#andariel-header">Andariel </a>and <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/resources/boss-loot-table-cheat-sheet#harbinger-of-hatred-header">Harbinger of Hatred</a> loot pools. The challenge in both cases is that it feels like Ancestral gear drops so freaking infrequently.  The above image shows a T3 Beast in the Ice drop pool&#8230;  with zero ancestrals dropping which is pretty much the norm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29931" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250929-170848205.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mostly I have been focused on chipping away at various seasonal trappings like the challenges, battlepass, and the Reign of Chaos quest chain. The amount of farming required to finish the last bit&#8230; seems excessive. I feel like Blizz has made the determination that they need to slow things down&#8230; to eek more player engagement out of a season, when in truth Season 7 was the best&#8230; because it felt like a really fun weekend, similar to how Diablo III seasons used to feel.  The game is not detailed enough to be played in a manner like Path of Exile&#8230; so any slowing of things down just feels like overstaying its welcome. Wouldn&#8217;t you rather have your players saying &#8220;wow that was a blast, can&#8217;t wait for next season&#8221; instead of trying to decide if they give a crap enough to keep grinding. I am rapidly the approaching the point where I am questioning how much I still care.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29928" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wow-20250930-100013330.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Legion Remix starts next week on the 7th, and as a result I have been trying to poke my head back into World of Warcraft in an attempt to get into the swing of things.  Friends&#8230;  I really want to finish up the War Within campaign but I am finding it so hard to care about anything that is going on.  I tried again last night, and I was just checking boxes off a spreadsheet in the way that I was engaging with the content.  I am playing my Dark Iron Dwarf that I rolled during the Pandaria remix event, and honestly&#8230; I like playing a defensive warrior about as much as I like playing anything else.  The combat though&#8230; just feels so much less interesting than it does in Guild Wars 2, which is the game I have mostly been mainlining in the MMORPG world for awhile.  I think mostly movement just feels bad, since at its core&#8230; World of Warcraft is just prettier Everquest and there is not any real action elements of my movement that factor into how combat resolves. So long as I am in rage of the target and my bounding box is connected to their bounding box&#8230; mashing a button makes a thing happen. It does somewhat make me worry how Legion Remix is going to land&#8230;  but regardless I am still going to give it a shot I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29932" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ffxiv_dx11-20250930-101218125.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In other things happening on the 7th&#8230;  the Monster Hunter Wilds crossover event is opening in Final Fantasy XIV.  I thought this might have been a good signal to get back into the game and quest through things&#8230;  given that I have not really played actively other than logging in to keep my house active since the patch that dropped the Arcadion. As a result I am fully decked out in that gear&#8230;  but am going to be yet again&#8230; too short to ride the ride since the Guardian fight is going to require 725 gear.  This is the thing that I always hate the most about playing Final Fantasy XIV, is that when it comes time for a new expansion&#8230;  my gear is never good enough to make it through all of the content without either grinding a bunch&#8230;  or buying my way out of the problem.  I hate having to buy a crafted set from the auction house to bail my ass out for having not played reliably during the patch cycle. Since Stormblood&#8230; I have basically been a player that plays heavily at the beginning of an Expansion, and then returns at the very end of one&#8230;  and it is honestly a play pattern that feels like crap because of the required catch up. Even Gacha games every so often throw you a bone with a full set of gear that is good enough to do whatever the latest content drop is.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29927" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GracieonHeadreset.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since you have made it this far, and listened to me whine about my frustrations and struggle to get attached to anything right now&#8230; I will reward you with another photo of Gracie. So often when I am gaming anymore, she will crawl up on the headrest of my new office chair and complain that I am not giving her attention. I am just looking for anything right now that gives me some focus.. and ultimately delays me thinking about the fact that my human is gone. I could be out doing things with friends&#8230;  but I feel way more &#8220;alone&#8221; when I am out in public than I do when I am finding something to distract me at home.  I spent a lot of time alone since shifting to remote work&#8230;  but I almost never left the house without my spouse.  So going into the world&#8230; makes me realize all that I am lacking and missing. There are a lot of things that I want to do around the house, but I end up in ADHD logjams while trying to do them.

On Tuesday the 10th Season dropped for Diablo IV and I have been spending a good chunk of my time playing a Pulverize Druid.  I am still mostly in my leveling build phase, but that is largely for lack of reasonable gear drops which I will talk about later.  I would love to tell you how many hours I have played, but there is no equivalent of the /played command in this game, nor is there a stats panel like we have in Diablo III.  Once upon a time there was a third party tool that filled in this gap, but it seems like either they have stopped supporting it or Blizzard asked them to take it down&#8230; because it now simply redirects to the D4 page on Battle.net. I&#8217;d sat out the last few seasons, and in my mind that makes me think that must have been sometime last year. No&#8230; I last played during <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/02/06/season-seven-complete-ish/">season seven</a>&#8230; which was January of 2025.  It feels like maybe they are speed running seasons&#8230; and should maybe stop and have a think about this pacing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29923" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250929-073119792.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are coming to this blog post having not played Diablo IV since launch, you probably only want one question answered. Is Diablo IV Good Yet? That is a complicated question, because I can definitely with resounding authority tell you that it is no longer an objectively bad game.  The classes seem relatively balanced, at least in the fact that there is a long list of class builds that are performing well.  However, would I consider the game to be &#8220;good&#8221; when judged against other ARPGs? Then probably not.  It is a flawed experience and continues to spend its time creating disposable content without really adding anything to the game that really feels like it moves the needle forward.  In fact there are a few things that they have done that actively feel like a step backwards. They no longer refer to things as &#8220;powers&#8221; but in truth the new Chaos perks shown above&#8230; are just a rebranded versions of temporary powers.  What I would love to see is the game introducing content that adds more things to do permanently to the game, and not just a less than three month long temporary chase.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29921" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250927-101501838.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first problem that I find with this game is that gearing is a bit of a mess.  What I mean by this is that I can relatively comfortably do the World on Torment 3, and Bosses on Torment 2&#8230; and have long passed the point where any piece of gear that is not ancestral could possibly be useful.  Ancestral gear&#8230; even at T3&#8230; feels exceptionally rare.  In fact I can&#8217;t really feel any difference in loot availability between T2 and T3 other than the fact that I can speed farm T2. At some point during the seasons that I missed, they flatted the gearing to remove the awkward step of getting Sanctified gear&#8230;  but also apparently made Ancestral gear feel a bit like unobtainium.  It was a few days until I had reached a point where every non-Unique item that I was wearing was Ancestral.  This was legitimately a thing that used to take two or three runs, not multiple days worth of fruitless grinding to get to.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29916" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250929-064239378.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Worse than this&#8230; I am probably 40 hours into the game at this point&#8230; maybe more&#8230; and I have a single item that I would consider to be worth investing time and effort into upgrading.  Everything else I am wearing&#8230; is utterly disposable.  What I really need are some Ancestral versions of the other Uniques that my build wants&#8230; and while I have run countless copies of the bosses that supposedly drop them.  I maybe see a single Ancestral every three to four runs&#8230;  meaning almost everything I loot is utterly useless.  By this point in previous seasons when I was still actively playing the game, I was hunting for Mythics or looking for more perfect versions of Uniques&#8230;  not struggling to find the items needed to actually make the build function.  This frustration is compounded by the fact that the game lacks anything really resembling a proper trade system.  You can shout into the void in the trade channel and might possibly get a response, but generally speaking the amount of gold that someone is asking is just stupid.  It is not like gold is actually useful in the game, as I am sitting on 150 million right now&#8230;  but because it has no real value it just seems to be a wild number that people throw around with folks trying to sell things for 500 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29915" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250929-065426461.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am slowly chipping away at the seasonal quests, and have made it up to the Champion level which requires Torment III for everything.  I still feel like I need to get a bit stronger before I tackle some of the bossing on this one, and while I have done a Pit 50&#8230;  the boss on it was a bit painful.  Technically I am still running the leveling version of the build, and should likely at some point swap over to the proper setup.  I was trying to find the last few pieces of gear as Ancestral before doing this, but in theory I could do it right now I suppose and see if it makes a difference. The new Chaos Rift content is not terribly enjoyable, and the fact that we do not have a new helltide like mechanic to farm makes everything in the season feel slow.  I still do not love Helltide in general, but I like the alternate versions of it like the Vampire or Witch themed ones we have gotten in previous seasons, because they seem way more focused.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29914" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250929-065443620.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am also not the biggest fan of what they did to the battle pass, where it is technically four separate battle passes that have to be unlocked individually.  You gain Favor which seems to roll out pretty quickly enough, and then spend that favor to unlock items on the passes.  The whole segmentation of this system feels like it was explicitly designed to make players spend more money unlocking it. While I am sure Blizzard will refer to this as &#8220;content&#8221; it very much feels like taking the same small amount of butter and trying to spread it over way more slices of bread.  I will be honest&#8230; I was feeling pretty charitable about this season until I sat down and started to write about my individual feelings about various components of it.  This is going to come across as a hit piece on the game, and I really do not intend it to be&#8230;  it is a fun but ultimately flawed gaming experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29922" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250926-144229251.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They did get me to spend some money, because a few days into this season they introduced a series of Starcraft themed skins, similar to the World of Warcraft theme ones they released in the past.  They coaxed me out of some money then to buy the Lich King skin&#8230; and this time around it was Raynor and Corrupted Marine skins.  The game is a gorgeous game, and they do create a bunch of really cool cosmetics for it&#8230;  but it also clearly tells me that they are spending way more effort on the cash shop than they are the rest of the game experience.  Diablo has been Fortnite-fied where the gameplay loop is largely kept the same, but you are presented with a constant drumbeat of nostalgia bombs, begging for you to open your wallet and give them some of your money. I am a sucker&#8230; I suggest you not be one. I blame Destiny 2 and Gacha games for slowly grinding down my resistance to this complete bullshit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29913" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250929-070050394.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the biggest challenge that I am having right now&#8230; is I am not really sure what I should be doing to get over the humps I am dealing with and move on to Torment IV. There is no clear thing that I need to be farming to improve my chances at getting the gear that I need. Maxroll has a <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/resources/boss-loot-table-cheat-sheet">boss loot table guide,</a> and in theory I need to be targeting those, but given that again&#8230; any item that does not drop at Ancestral is useless&#8230;  it does not feel great to farm bosses.  I think the two biggest outliers that I need are an Ancestral version of Insatiable Fury which drops from Grigoire&#8230; which means I need to farm stupid amounts of Helltide to get more summons. I also need an Ancestral copy of Vasily&#8217;s Prayer which drops from Varshan&#8230;  which is largely farmed through getting Tree of Whispers caches.  I am doing lots of both&#8230;  but they are somewhat mind-numbing and the key drop rate is pretty low. Nothing feels worse than seeing the items technically dropping&#8230; but without Ancestral rarity&#8230;  once again making them not worth my time even picking up really.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29918" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250929-062211759.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those times where Path of Exile and having access to a functional&#8230; and now automated&#8230; trade economy is a mass improvement.  I could save up resources and pick up the items that I am missing, and maybe start selling off some of the items that do drop that I have no use for in order to fund those upgrades.  More than that, I feel like Path of Exile is a bit easier to tell what is wrong with your character, and why you can&#8217;t do higher tier content.  Granted that just might be my level of familiarity with the game.  Builds in Diablo III and IV both work on gimmick interactions between abilities, that cause wild exponential scaling to amp up your damage, and in order to trigger that&#8230; you need very specific items in specific slots with specific stat combinations.  Last Epoch is quite possibly the best game for gearing because you can get up and running really quickly, and then it becomes just a matter of perfecting your gear over time rather than making it super hard to find the pieces that you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29912" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250929-070316765.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So to the original question of &#8220;Is it Good Now?&#8221;.  I would say honestly it is good enough to have fun with it. There are frustrations, but you can at very least make it through the campaign without having to deal with them.  Everything that I have talked about in this post with disdain&#8230; are end game issues.  You should be able to at a minimum get to Torment 1 with very little effort.  I was doing that almost immediately after dinging level 60. Everything else is just how willing you are to grind it out.  I used to have a lot of fun grouping up with my friend Ace and chain running bosses&#8230; but that is pretty much a nonstarter these days because everyone has to spend boss mats in order to get loot, so there is no longer that force multiplier that there used to be.  Once the 0.3.1 patch drops in Path of Exile II, I will probably be back over there testing out the endgame changes.  I am enjoying playing a Bear Druid, but not so much that the next thing that interests me would not immediately pull my attention away from the game. If Destiny Rising did not have clear caps on how much you can do in a given day&#8230; I would likely be over there playing it instead of grinding here.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/09/29/ancestral-or-bust/">Ancestral or Bust</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/09/29/ancestral-or-bust/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '29911'}

For awhile now I have used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X8SJ8HM">wireless headset downstairs</a> with my laptop, and I have come to love it. The only real problem with it is that I wish it were semi-open like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JOETX8">Superlux headphones</a> that I use upstairs.  When led me down the path of wishing there was a way to convert a normal wired headset to a wireless one.  After a bit of back and forth on mastodon, I found an option that is pretty tiny and weighs almost nothing. There are a bunch of versions of this, but the one that I purchased is from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5VBKCLZ">MIPEACE</a> and it essentially hangs off the short cord directly from the headphones as seen in the image above. I thought I would need to attach it somehow to the outside of my headset, but since it is so lightweight it seems to be able to just hang there comfortably.  I charged it up last night, and now I am curious if it can get through the entire day on a single charge.  I will of course report back how well this works out.  I am keeping music running in the background so I know when it cuts out.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29884" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250925-070749895.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am still a bit all over the place right now, spending time in Diablo IV, New World, and Destiny Rising.  If I had to claim a main game right now, it would probably be Diablo IV since I am trying to level up and push into the end game.  I am taking it super chill right now.  I am sure I could grind up in a single afternoon if I really focused on it, but I do that during Path of Exile leagues&#8230;  and since I don&#8217;t take Diablo near as seriously there is no point not to just slow roll this.  The Druid felt sort of awful for the first few levels but now it feels pretty solid.  Namely when I got some sort of spirit recovery I have been able to mostly just run around pulverizing things.  I have enough defenses that I can largely just gather things up in a big pack and them smash them to bits with my beary goodness.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29883" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250925-065311011.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I always wish I did&#8230;. while leveling, was focus on the various strongholds.  This is one of those things that are nice to have unlocked&#8230; but also something that I never really want to go back and do later.  So this time around I finally smartened up and that has essentially been my focus.  As of this morning prior to sitting down to write this blog post, I have now opened every single stronghold and it got me to level 46.  Now I just need to find some other activity to grind out the rest of the levels and start the endgame proper.  Other than Strongholds, I have also popped around the map unlocking the various waypoints so that when I do hit the endgame, I won&#8217;t be hamstrung by not having a port open while doing events.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29885" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250925-065215093.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between lunch breaks and this evening, I am going to see if I can hit level 60 and start working on Paragon levels.  In theory if I hang out in the hellfire areas it should go quickly enough.  I&#8217;ve done a world boss and a legions event, but the experience gain there seemed pretty slow.  At some point I should probably bump up the difficulty, but really since the same gear drops on the first two difficulties there has not been much of a reason to do it.  I think I am tanky enough to handle it without much issue, but I am also exceptionally lazy. I need to probably start running some content that reliably drops legendaries so I can collect the necessary affixes needed for my eventual build.  I need to look at the maxroll guide I have been following and seeing which affixes come from dungeons, and then get those knocked out while I am still leveling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29889" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250924-182433023.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I connected up with Ace again last night.  We had not really been planning on doing so, but I just happened to notice that they were online when I was starting to grind out my pinnacle rewards for the day.  We ran a handful of strikes and mostly it was just a good excuse to hang out on voice and chat while doing activities.  I promise I am not super vain&#8230; but I still have to screenshot any time I get MVP at the end of a match, especially if it is as Jolder.  Generally speaking MVPs tend to favor those characters that deal large amounts of damage, and/or provides some sort of support benefit.  I do find it hilarious that &#8220;Damage Taken&#8221; is a thing that the game is tracking as something that is good. My job as a defensive character though is to get up in the bosses face and try and get it to focus on me&#8230; since I have my health bar and a full over-shield bar most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29890" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250924-171736560.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been doing the planetary dailies on Finnala, and while I do not really love the character&#8230; It has still been fun.  Essentially each of the champions has some sort of activities in their lore panel that it asks you to do.  For Nala it is do 10 days worth of the destination daily quests in the Red Sea Rift area.  Jolder had the same quest chain and I have already completed hers, so I figured I might as well be knocking them out for another character since I am going to do a set of these every day regardless.  At some point though I really need to shift focus on the Jiangshi Metro area because my faction level there is pretty pitiful.  That first zone is just nowhere near as well designed as the second zone, so it is way less enjoyable just to run around killing stuff in.  When I need to do a bounty&#8230; I tend to pop down to Red Sea Rift instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29893" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AeternumMap.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I went through the process of setting up Overwolf last night, so that I could start running <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/leon_machens-aeternum_map">Aeternum Map</a> on the second monitor.  Essentially this allows me to keep up a map that tracks my progress through the world, and also shows me the locations of all of the resource spawn points.  I have some zones in the game memorized just from running them so much&#8230; for example there is a loop in Brightwood that I can run in my sleep.  However they have added a lot of higher tier resources into zones like Edengrove, and I figured I might as well have the map up so I can see if there is something that I want to make a beeline for.  I hate Overwolf&#8230;  so I only keep it running so long as I need it for the purpose of this map.  Overwolf is essentially keeping track of your location in the world, and all of the tools seem to rely on it to make the maps interactive.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29888" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NewWorld-20250924-205904582.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The positive of the map though is it has led me to explore some areas I probably never would have been.  For example there is a cave up near Shattered Mountain in Edengrove that is chock full of Mithril nodes.  Sure you have to find waves of the exploding blight mobs&#8230; and have to keep waiting on your blight bar to tick down, but I think I pulled almost 1000 ore just from this one location last night in a single pass.  Similarly I have made beelines off the path to find other precious nodes while exploring things.  One cool thing is that since the level cap is now 65&#8230;  things like Shattered Mountain are no longer as scary as they once were.  I need to get out there and explore a bit more, and maybe take down some of the bosses out there for funsies.  Every major boss spawn point&#8230; seems to always have a group at it.  Over the weekend I did a bunch of kills of Baines at the top of a tower in Edengrove, just because I happened to stumble upon a full party hanging out there.  Boss farming was one of my favorite things in this game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29894" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/InstallingHades2.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hades 2 is also leaving Early Access today, so at some point I will probably give that a spin.  I am installing it currently so I have it at the ready when I am in the mood to give it a go.  I know tonight we will be doing our normal Guild Wars 2 shenanigans.  I am hoping the crew is further along in the quest chain so that we can knock out some of the things that you cannot get through running quick play. I already have my Legendary Gloves, so mostly I just want to do whatever I can to help push the others through the process.  I feel like I am all over the place right now and having trouble focusing on any one thing in particular.  That is probably okay, given how much I hyper fixate on a single thing at a time for weeks.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/09/25/suspicious-dongle/">Suspicious Dongle</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/09/25/suspicious-dongle/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'post-id': '29879'}

I finally washed the towels, but here is a picture of Gracie guarding against leaks. Yesterday was a lot.  Not only did I have the fasting blood draw that I talked about yesterday, but I was trying to deal with a bunch of &#8220;death stuff&#8221; as I collectively call it.  Namely I have had a few checks come in that were in my spouse&#8217;s name&#8230;  after I had done what I thought was the right thing and removed her name from our banking accounts.  It seems as though I will have to file a case with the probate court and create an &#8220;estate&#8221; account in order to cash these now&#8230;  something that at a bare minimum will cost me $200 just for file the paperwork, let alone whatever I will need to pay a lawyer to draw up said paperwork.  Thus far the checks don&#8217;t even total $100&#8230;  so this is not likely something I will be doing.  I dealt with a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff yesterday, including calling the medical examiner to see if they have finally given a proper cause of death&#8230;. which they have&#8230; but now I am waiting for official death certificates.  All of this&#8230; extremely fucking draining.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29876" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250923-173922411.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The absolute high point of my evening was hanging out with my virtual sibling Ace and doing some Destiny Rising. We essentially hung out together and ground out a bunch of strikes, until we were both completely out of pinnacle currency&#8230; and then ran a few after that for good measure. For whatever reason we seemed to keep getting The Pit over and over, and stumbled onto a weird glitch in the matrix.  It seems that if you have gone down the path of becoming a Mentor&#8230; your light requirement is higher for queuing for heroics than when you were a &#8220;New Light&#8221;. This seems exceptionally lame, and led to a scenario to where they could not queue as anything other than Estela, the champion that they have most recently poured resources into to bump up.  This was a bit annoying when one of the dailies involved killing things with a void champion, and they could not play one.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29872" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250924-072121117.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My highest light champion is Jolder, which I am largely still maining.  However Estela, Wolf, and Umeko are all pretty close in ranking.  I&#8217;ve still not really found an Arc champion that I enjoy very well, and I am hoping that maybe the next premium banner will bring one that is a bit more enjoyable to play than anything I have gotten so far.  Ace pulled the Arc Staff guy and said that so far they seem pretty fun.  I am not too far from the Mythic choice pity on the normal banner, so in theory I will likely pick him as my choice when it comes down to that.  I really wish that the banner was just for pulling additional copies of champions for powering them up, and that there was a way to unlock every champion by default through a quest chain or something.  It really feels like that sort of thing would better serve a game like Destiny Rising, where so much of the game is based on team composition.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29874" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250924-070711467.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday was the launch of Diablo IV Season 10, and I rolled a new character to see how the game has progressed since I last paid attention to it.  I&#8217;ve sat out the last few seasons and for the most part&#8230; everything is perfectly cromulent.  I heard that the pulverize druid was really strong, so I ended up rolling one of those.  I think the challenge that both Druid and Barbarian have is that they feel sort of awful to play early game&#8230; but become godlike in the late game.  So you have to suffer a bit until your build comes online.  I am very thankful that at some point in the past I spent money on a nice looking cosmetic set&#8230; because the base druid vibe is not really my thing. I wish there was a way to just run around in Werebear form all of the time, because that shit is awesome.  I feel like this is missing out on something significantly here.  The game would be better if you could just always be Werebear or Werewolf.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29873" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Diablo_IV-20250924-065742823.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I have not made it super far, but I am also not really rushing it.  This morning my build started to come a bit more online and the Druid as a whole is feeling much better as I am now in my 20s.  I figure this is going to be something that I poke out off and on until I hit the level cap and build a reasonable build.  That said&#8230;  when a new Path of Exile season drops I am abandoning this. Additionally I know that Legion Remix is happening early in October and it is likely that if I have not hit the level cap and am farming the endgame by the time that comes out&#8230;  D4 is also getting dropped in favor of that. I&#8217;ve contemplated firing up World of Warcraft and trying to get caught up on the story there, but it still just doesn&#8217;t really feel right.  I am interested in a lot of the things that are going on in that game, but am not sure I am really in the mood for a traditional MMORPG experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29870" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NewWorld-20250924-073724745.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>New World on the other hand seems to be clicking pretty well.  I&#8217;ve swapped back to my level 65 main on Pangaea and spent a bit of time just roaming around and getting used to the combat again.  Mostly it is muscle memory that came back extremely quickly.  One of my favorite aspects of the game has always been roaming around and harvesting resources, and I am starting to do that again.  I did figure out how to upgrade gear, but the process is confusing and arduous and nowhere near as clear as it used to be.  I think Amazon Game studios suffers from some poor game design at times&#8230; and there are weird gates for things that should be more accessible.  The whole concept of needing to craft dungeon keys for example seems to still be a thing, and it is weird that you would not want your players just playing your content all of the time.  This is especially fraught given the great experiences we have had recently with the Fractal Incursion event in Guild Wars 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29871" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NewWorld-20250924-072821762.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that said, there are some pretty solid crafted gear options and I think in the short term I am going to focus more on leveling up my tradeskills.  Ultimately I would need to push things up to 250 in order to craft the best stuff, and a lot of my harvesting abilities are already climbing past 200. I am in no rush to do any of this, but I am interested to see what the new content that drops looks like.  The biggest problem I have had with the evolution of New World, is that it has removed zones from the game in order to rework them as something else.  I am hoping this new zone is actually that&#8230; new territory to be explored that has never existed in the game before. That is not to say that I don&#8217;t think that the reworked zones are not good steps&#8230;  but games need to expand&#8230;  not just be revised to death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyways. That is my yesterday.  Today I am back at work like normal and will probably futz around with Diablo IV some more this evening and see if I can get closer to the level cap.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/09/24/bears-and-blunderbusses/">Bears and Blunderbusses</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/09/24/bears-and-blunderbusses/feed/', 'slash_comments': '4', 'post-id': '29869'}

I am getting a bit of a late start to the blog this morning because I had to do a fasting blood draw.  Nothing serious, just one of those things that I have to do every year to keep from having to pay a $60 per month surcharge on our corporate insurance plan.  I took the day off because there are a bunch of things I should be doing around the house today&#8230;  namely because I got new glasses and can now properly see how dirty everything is.  As I was rushing out the door this morning, this lil fella was hanging out on the inside of my glass storm door.  He did not seem to be terribly intimidated by me, and when I got home from the blood draw appointment he was gone.  Hopefully he is off living his best life, because I have zero clue what sort of frog this is.  Guessing some sort of a tree frog, but given that I have never seen one in my life&#8230; I am hoping he did not hitch a ride on a thunderstorm and get rained down. Was a very smol fella, maybe the size of a fifty cent piece.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29865" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pitchroofwoes.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, specifically during the AggroChat podcast&#8230;  it rained in my living room&#8230;  which is a thing that has happened before, but not since we put a new roof on.  Thankfully the roofers came out and resealed the top of my roofline, which is where we have generally thought the water comes in through, because it has only ever leaked when we are getting a torrential downpour combined with wind&#8230; leading to horizontal rain.  It has been raining all morning which is adversely effecting my desire to do anything, but so far no sign of leakage. Due to the pitch of our roof and the odd late 70s architectural decisions, there is a lip of flashing that wind over time will push up&#8230; and then the water gets under there and eventually runs down under the shingles until it finds a point of entry. This is generally smack dab in the enter of our living room.  The roofers essentially resealed this area and put in longer screws which will hopefully keep it from coming up again.  We&#8217;ve had the house since 1999&#8230; and fought this dumb design flaw many times, but hopefully this will be the trick that finally solves it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29864" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GW2-LegoGlovesGet.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> In gaming news, with the roll over of the weekly reset in Guild Wars 2 it allowed me to get my <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Eikasia,_Mists-Grasper">pair of legendary gloves</a>.  This is honestly really cool and way easier than I expected it to be in the long run, because essentially you mostly have to just grind out 500 dust which will complete all of the required achievements and then talk to the Mist Stranger, at which point they will reveal who they actually are and give you a choice box for gloves. You get one armor weight for free and then for the other two you have to grind out 300 more dust which will give you 2 <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractalline_Spark">Fractalline Spark</a> (150 each), one for each of the remaining weights. You then combine each with a <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Magical_Prosperity">Gift of Magical Prosperity</a>, <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Mighty_Prosperity">Gift of Mighty Prosperity</a>, and 200g worth of <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Icy_Runestone">Icy Runestones</a> to get another pair of gloves. These are permanent additions to the game and not something that you necessarily have to compete before the event ends in October.  I am however planning on grinding out a few more sparks so that I can bank them because they are also used for coloring the weapon glow effects granted by the gloves.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29867" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250923-085953904.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Over in Destiny Rising, I have set my sights on knocking out some of the lore achievements.  Namely right now I am working on the achievement where you have to get 5 cats to give you a reward back while playing Umeko.  The whole feeding the cats thing is a big maddening, namely because the indication of what fish the cats want each day is not great.  I need to start fishing up some new areas in the game since I appear to have unlocked a few other locations.  However even if the cat does not give you a carepackage, it does seem to count as getting a reward because you get some fishing currency for the first time you attempt it each day. I think tonight Ace and I are going to run amok, so that should be quite a bit of fun.  I need to hang out on voice with various groups of people more often, because quite honestly I can get stuck in my head a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29857" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NewWorld-20250922-192613865.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been fiddling around with New World again and holy crap has it changed significantly, at least in the new player onboarding process.  I have a max level character, but also have zero clue what I need to be doing.  So I instead decided to roll another new character just so I could play through the early levels and get my feet under me again.  Now when you start a character you are asked to choose an archetype, which guarantees a combo of abilities and gives you a bit of a boost to specific tradeskills. I opted for Greatsword and Blunderbuss because it gave me a pretty solid early combo, but have long since abandoned the shotgun like weapon for more twohanders&#8230; leveling both Two Handed Axe and Two Handed Hammer.  I really like flail for tanking, so I might also start working on that, but more than anything.  I am not really sure how long I will end up playing this baby character before moving back to my maxed out character.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29862" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NewWorld-20250923-071813608.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that is wild is just how much more story there is, and it appears to be fully voiced.  Like the graphical style of New World is a bit janky, but this does feel like a significantly more enjoyable onboarding process.  I know this is essentially the third time I have rerolled from scratch.  The leveling process seems to have been sped up considerably, but the tradeskill leveling process is still a bit of a slog.  I also remember now that I do not love how much of a nesting doll the entire process is where Tier 1 is needed to make Tier 2 which is also needed to make Tier 3 and so on.  I had hoped that maybe they would have streamlined this process a bit, but it seems like that is not the case.  I leveled up enough to craft a full set of level 60 armor on both characters, and in theory one should probably not do this thing and just live off drops.  I need to figure out how the heck you upgrade items now, because I have not figured that out.  I know 700 is the baseline and I think you can go up to 750 item level&#8230;  but I have no clue how to upgrade my uniques to those tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29859" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NewWorld-20250922-193806720.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The introductory mission is way cooler looking, so I will give the game that. Additionally the flow of the quests seems to be a bit more thought out. There seems to be a fairly thriving community, but also it appears to be mostly console based.  The number of random strangers talking in the world through proximity chat is very much still a thing.  I know Destiny Rising has some of that going on, and I also experienced that while playing EVE Vanguard.  Maybe I should get over my aversion to talking to strangers over voice chat&#8230;  but seriously it still wigs me out. Does no one type anymore?  I will always prefer reading the written word to talking over voice unless I am talking to friends.  I know this is contradictory to what I said earlier, in that I need to hang out with friends on voice&#8230;  but the friends bit is the key differentiator there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is also the start of the next Diablo IV season, so I am probably going to get off here and scurry around the house attempting to take care of some business so I can potentially have time to start a new character when that begins.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/09/23/froggy-woggy/">Froggy Woggy</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/09/23/froggy-woggy/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '29855'}

I played a truly excessive amount of Destiny Rising over the weekend. One of the big takeaways of the weekend is that while you have a limited amount of pinnacle rewards currency&#8230;  doing content without this currency is still worth doing.  Namely grinding Strikes and Gauntlet Blitz can still reward some really good stuff and I managed to pull more than a handful of level 80 mythics over the weekend, that I could then turn around and infuse into my existing weapons to level them up to 80.  I essentially got past the Affinity 10 barrier which gives me access to level 80 everything, and as a result I am slowly chipping away at leveling everything that matters to me up to that point.  Unfortunately there do not appear to be craftable engrams that reward anything at level 80&#8230;  so even getting a god roll now means that you are going to have to push it up from 70 for it to be useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29850" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250920-072549489.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of god rolled weapons, I had three stacks of the mythic engram currency so I have been crafting the choice engrams in an effort to pick up better weapon rolls.  Essentially in a perfect world I would get weapons with two recommended mythic stats on them&#8230;  but for now I am cycling through the weapons trying to get ANY weapon with four mythic mods on it. At this point I think I have knocked out all of the main weapons that I am using on my characters, and now am cycling back through and trying to get four mods for all of the mythic weapons.  In theory I should probably be focusing on the characters that I actually use and perfecting their weapons&#8230;  but I am a weirdo and crave variety over specialization.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29846" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250921-143936277.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This weekend I gathered up enough currency to make another pull on the Estela banner and managed to bit pity by 14 pulls.  Not phenomenal but I will take it, and quite honestly&#8230;  this character is awesome.  I&#8217;ve poured what limited resources I had available to trying to build her up to the level of my other characters.  Right now I am still maining Jolder, but also trying to buff up Gwynn, Estela, Umeko, and of course Wolf.  In truth I find it that I really don&#8217;t care that much about any of the Arc characters right now.  I&#8217;ve leveled both Kabr and Xuan Wei, but in truth I should probably start putting points into Attal because she seems generally more useful.  There just isn&#8217;t really an Arc character that I am immediately drawn to, not in the same way that I have various Solar and Void champs that I dig out of the box.  I swear Estela sounds like she is being voiced by Felicia Day, but I don&#8217;t think that is actually the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29841" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250922-063419689.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The only champion that I have not pulled at this point is Ning Fei, which is seemingly a real powerhouse given how much I see him on the leaderboards.  I just don&#8217;t know that he is really my play style either though, as I have done the trial and did not really enjoy it that much.  However I also felt that way about Estela but now that I have gotten used to that playstyle I am really enjoying it quite a bit.  Debuffing targets to kill them faster with weapons&#8230; seems like a really solid playstyle that none of the other champions are doing in quite the same way.  She deals a sort of damage that almost feels like Chaos damage from Path of Exile in that it is able to sap the health of a target&#8230;. even if they are shielded.  Thankfully the normal banner currency is easier to get so hopefully at some point I will luck into the final character that I am missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29847" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250921-140654583.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ace and I spent quite a bit of time grouping up on Sunday, which is always fun.  They managed to beat the campaign this weekend and as such started entering the proper endgame and the &#8220;gotta catch em all&#8221; phase of trying to collect all of the mythic weapons. Grouping together allowed me to actually knock out a few MVP triumphs as I am normally not the one dealing the most damage with my particular choice of characters.  We ran several Gauntlet Blitz, and Heroic Strikes&#8230; and then did some of the legacy content so that we could unlock all three elements.  Basically in order to send someone out on Iron Commander missions, you have to have beaten the content once the normal way.  The legacy elemental strikes all have a bonus when run as an Iron Commander missions, so it feels like the game is trying to push us to do those.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29844" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250921-174559240.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that really impresses me with Destiny Rising, is that so far every single character I have actually spent any modicum of time playing&#8230;  is a character that I have enjoyed. Even Xuan Wei who is HYPER melee focused&#8230; is really fun if you spend time playing him.  It just isn&#8217;t a play style that really makes sense for most of the content in the game.  Running around on the planets and looking for secrets has been a great way to get used to these characters, and while I was not sold on for example Umeko&#8230;  she is a character that I have been playing a lot more specifically in some of the PVX game modes.  It turns out that having the longest range attacks are really useful in things like the Iron Bar which is this games annoyingly renamed Iron Banner.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29852" height="528" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MessageFromJolder.jpg?resize=880%2C528&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that I love is how much heart the game has.  For example I got this random sequence of texts from Jolder at some point this weekend.  I am guessing it triggered off some event or triumph that I got, and it will only make sense if you have played the Jolder storyline.  However I found it pretty hilarious.  The character interactions and the specific character focused storylines have been so much fun to play through.  I have a stack of characters that I need to play more, so that I can unlock more of their story&#8230; and I honestly feel the desire to do this thing.  The only character that feels a bit like a wet blanket though is Ikora, which saddens me&#8230;  because she was a character I really liked interacting with in Destiny 2.  The main problem with her is that the single shot grenade launcher as your primary weapon thing&#8230; is a bit annoying to play around.  When you run strikes&#8230; it just means you are never going to get credit for doing any damage because she is so much slower than everyone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29851" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250920-072410486.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a new game mode starting in a week or so, and I am super interested to see what it ends up being.  I am hoping it is not just a new difficulty level for existing content.  I have to admit I was a bit disappointed when I found out that the new timed raid mode&#8230; was just a version of the existing raid and not something new.  That is ultimately going to be the challenge for Destiny Rising.  If they can keep introducing new content, and not just rehashed content&#8230; they are going to win the loyalty of a lot of players.  That has been the struggle that Destiny 1/2 has been having, is that they cannot seem to keep up with player demand.  I am hoping when we get a new story drop, we also get a new planet to explore, or at least a new region of earth.  During some of the story missions you get the hint that it might be the European zones that will be coming into the game next as you run into some folks from that region.  I would really love to visit Mars again though, because of all of the planets we have played on&#8230; that is probably my favorite setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29840" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250922-063428062.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another side effect of playing quite a bit this weekend is I managed to finish off the battle pass. This and the subscription were the purchases that I ended up making for the game, and in truth both have been good.  Given how much time I have spent playing I figured it was worth spending a bit of money. Once I got into the endgame proper, the battle pass levels just sort of flew by because you end up getting a bunch of repeatable quests to do 3 strikes as X role.  Given that I am grinding a lot of strikes, even without having pinnacle currency&#8230;  the levels just sort of happened on their own.  I ended up pulling the pink skin for the Furies III weapon which is pretty good looking. I am curious what the post 50 battle pass ranks are going to look like, because it seems like you are going to keep getting rewards chests each time you ding a new rank.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29849" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MuMuNxDevice-20250920-140750538.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all I am having a heck of a lot of fun with this game.  I even enjoy the card game, which is wild because I have not spent much time playing most card games that are embedded within other games.  Essentially it is a game of making the number go up, and not a game of direct engagement.  Sure there are specific cards that allow you to remove units from the board, but it isn&#8217;t quite so focused on killing players quickly.  Everyone has a fixed number of turns to score as many points as you can, and I dig that.  Anyways&#8230; at least for now I am deeply engaged in Destiny Rising. I am curious how long this present obsession will last.  I know this week we have the releases of Hades 2 into 1.0, and then tomorrow is the start of a Diablo IV season and I have contemplated checking that out again.  I also reinstalled New World, because there is an event coming up soon&#8230; but I am so hopelessly lost in to what you actually need to do in that game to progress anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now though Destiny Rising in my comfort game.  Did you ever give it a shot? What were your thoughts?

Chemo hit me a bit harder this time. I took Monday and Tuesday off because I was not feeling great at all. I was back to work on Wednesday, but even then, I was in cold sweats all day and just generally feeling tired. Nausea hit me this time as well, which I wasn\'t expecting. I wasn\'t throwing up or anything, just had what felt like a big knot in my stomach. Kind of weird.</p><p>I was hoping to have a little music therapy on Friday as well, but my therapist cancelled because she was sick. Hopefully next time! Speaking of next time, upcoming next will be another CAT scan and more immunotherapy in just a couple of weeks. I\'m still doing my homeopathic stuff alongside my regular treatment, and I hope the upcoming scans show more improvements.</p><p>As for how I\'m physically feeling, I feel a little better, but I\'ve been having some smaller, more localized pains in my back and side. I\'m not sure if that\'s things getting better or worse.&nbsp; Hopefully better. We\'ll have to see.&nbsp; One thing is for sure, it\'s been nice being able to sleep on my side and with a pillow again.&nbsp;</p><p>I would appreciate the traditional thoughts, prayers, love, vibes, voodoo, mantras, and you-name-it for healing. I worry about this thing spreading. It\'s one of my main fears actually.&nbsp; That and the fear of a government shutdown next week, but we\'ll approach that if and when it happens.&nbsp;</p><p>Happy Dueling!</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/09/cancer-journey-and-real-life-update-for.html'}], 'link': 'https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/09/cancer-journey-and-real-life-update-for.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Stingite', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Stingite)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Stingite', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7CcdsGCOonhL6nMO_99_6egGefqONx_bY-550ZbYhT8CWCBliKPH_XqAjZp5eMvD1Nh7KwOvoc3ENywJ8gbVs9gqYON0Wl1Ls4dT6Con6Xtg08JK3YCEqcrZ9S5z1cQB3BHXnTPoT6h6g-iQLpk7XLWhTdYWOWQCBFC-UHRUh52ru5YPF_1h5lcLuYwU/s72-w300-h400-c/555533446_10237202137328762_162464513732312608_n.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '8'}

I also dropped $12 bucks on a humble bundle deal that supplied me with 16 games that I\'ve never played before. I\'m doomed. (Not to mention all the great shows I still need to watch on Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Apple+, Prime, and on and on) It\'s nice to have so many distractions. First world problems at its best.</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: Speaking of video game distractions, I\'ve started reskinning my 1up machine to look like an honest to goodness Ghosts n\' Goblins machine! Looking pretty great! So fun to play the classic Ghosts n\' Goblins whenever I want. I\'ve almost bumped the previous owner\'s high score off of the Top Ten (yes, I know I could just reset the machine, but where\'s the fun in that? The initials TDP will crush any memories of there even being a previous CPB as number one!)</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg6Y7nPw8ireBm0qc9FBoXyPCv9ssDMeeNyLTDAHjP-Xe_V88G_dELIWhXXALDlIL1qSIVq_oupW_L93wcwK_mjLjgueQNsK_t30oxzVFnuH9DmpWP9yW_cNuw4gEDz-PfxsRwGiuU9YTxwictBe4T-2bfek6PZWOx3HqM4UIvR5MYgpEn95qekQuZUNp0" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg6Y7nPw8ireBm0qc9FBoXyPCv9ssDMeeNyLTDAHjP-Xe_V88G_dELIWhXXALDlIL1qSIVq_oupW_L93wcwK_mjLjgueQNsK_t30oxzVFnuH9DmpWP9yW_cNuw4gEDz-PfxsRwGiuU9YTxwictBe4T-2bfek6PZWOx3HqM4UIvR5MYgpEn95qekQuZUNp0=w185-h400" width="185" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Love the goofy 80\'s fun graphics!</i></div></i><p></p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: Man, the stickers that go on behind the screen and below the joysticks are going to be tough to place!

If I boldly could ask for new thoughts, prayers, blessings, and mantras to focus in on my own immune system working to kill cancer with the help of immunotherapy and that my own immune system won\'t turn on me in the process, it would be more than I should ask for, and I appreciate it.&nbsp;</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: Don\'t worry, you won\'t be blamed if my immune system does turn on me -- that\'d all be blamed on my own Cosmic Radiation and bad luck. 😉</p><p>Thank you "Team Tom."

COVID and a quarantined reality solidly hit everyone in 2020. I was staying home and with extra time on my hands. My buddy at work had a group named Bueno Sueno and they had just released a song called Lost in the Shine. I convinced him to send me the stems and flexed my remixing muscles with a mix I called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgtQu2zECs">Tom Purdue Shimmer Mix</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That remix set off a bug in me, and I started remixing or remaking some deep cut songs that were meaningful to me in one way or another. Before I knew it, I had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vWqp7YBZE&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHpgc58cpOgeOQY7F_nR3h9S">whole playlist of remixes and remakes on YouTube</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Cetu Javu\'s Fight Without a Reason (Lifestyle Remix)</li><li>Morrissey\'s Now My Heart is Full (Bunny Love Remix)</li><li>Cabaret Voltaire\'s Code (Wah Guitar Mix)</li><li>The Cure\'s Night Like This (Deeper Still Mix)</li><li>Decussion Council\'s (yes, my old high school band) Don\'t Stop (Everyone Hang On Mix)</li><li>Tom Purdue\'s Bit by Bit (2020 Mix)</li></ul><p></p><p>I wrote about all of them in&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2020/06/mixtape-fire-my-past-month-in-flames.html">this blog post from June 2020</a>. As mentioned in that blog post, I formulated a plan to release a lathe print vinyl record with a very small print run . . . 4-5 copies through a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://americanvinylco.com/product-category/one-off-and-short-run-vinyl-records/">American Vinyl</a>. When I got the records back, I thought they sounded horrible. I hadn\'t mixed the songs considering volume levels and how they would actually play on a record player. I threw them in the garbage can in disgust.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, who is much smarter than me, saved them out of the garbage can and instead stashed them in a secret spot that I would only find later when we were moving from Texas back to Utah. (which . . . is a story all unto itself.) Turns out it was mostly the fault of our bad record player at the time. There were a few sub-bass hits on the Don\'t Stop mix that were just too low and distorted a bit, but that\'s it. The record sounds great.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/s4000/20240406_195749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/w185-h400/20240406_195749.jpg" width="185" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Not the white album, it\'s a Quarantined Mix Record from Tom Purdue!</i></p><p>For real though, the life as a rock star wannabe had become nothing more than a dusty, distant 30-year-old memory up until 2021 when a great guy named Adam Terry contacted me over Instagram holding both my Darkest America and Freeze tapes from back in 1990.

With Adam\'s help, the hope of actually releasing some old music of mine on his label,&nbsp;<a href="https://fountainavm.com/">FountainAVM</a>, was now a possibility! He asked to hear more of my stuff and I flooded his Dropbox with hours upon hours of old music I had recorded on tape.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s1910/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s320/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" width="251" /></a></div><br /><p>Adam was fantastic! I\'ve never had anyone dump so many hours of their life just dedicated to listening to my music. Honestly, the real help from Adam has been feeling like someone actually cared about me as an artist enough to reach out and help me dust off the old tapes. While there may be a lot of sadness and regret from the past, his simple act of reaching out kind of unplugged so many things that I had bottled up over the years. That alone was appreciated.</p><p>From all that, Adam curated two albums of music.&nbsp; The first was just released last year. <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2024/03/an-ant-survives-rainstorm.html">As discussed in this post</a>:</p><p><i>"My new "old" album was released today by FOUNTAINavm.

I\'m happy with the result. I\'ve enjoyed riding around in my car late at night listening to An Ant Survives A Rainstorm and hope you would too.</i></p><p><i>Thanks to FOUNTAINavm for releasing this music and thanks for listening!"</i></p><p>While discussing old music with Adam, we also started discussing new music (well new music to me), and he turned me on to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6R1cNisR3xvk0ivHz13P6E">Minimalist Wave Tapes</a> project, so I started listening to it plus some old formative, meaningful music to me from the 70\'s - 90\'s like Kraftwerk, Boards of Canada, Yaz, Thompson Twins, and the Psychedelic Furs. After baptizing myself in all this music and having recently remade Bit by Bit for my Quarantined Mixes, I realized I could make a synthwave album of my own.</p><p>The end result was Red Pinto Hatchback, released in 2021. I actually made two posts about this one. One about the making of <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/09/red-pinto-hatchback-cover-art.html">the cover art</a>, and one <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/10/red-pinto-hatchback-launched.html">about the album release itself</a>. As I stated in that post:</p><p><i>". . . So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette. Truly, if you have a Walkman, I\'d love to get my music in there for you to enjoy on your new walk down old memory lane.</i></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/s3043/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/w640-h388/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" width="640" /></i></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>No school like the old school</i></p><p><i>I have to talk a bit about the title track to Rotted Leisure Rooms. It\'s a gritty industrial piece that features the synth work of David Kane. Back in 1988 I was watching 120 minutes on MTV when a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DiNYb20WY">Baby Doe Rules</a> by David Kane\'s Decay of the Western Civilization came on, and I recorded it on VHS tape. I asked every record shop I could find in Utah if they had it so I could listen to more, and no one knew what I was talking about.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Eventually I transferred the song off of VHS tape to audio tape so I could listen to it in my car. It was a rare track that no one knew. I think they played Baby Doe Rules only a handful of times late at night on MTV, but there was something about the raw sampled, industrial goodness of this track that in a way gave me permission to do the same. It was truly an inspirational track for me.</i></p><p><i>Just a year and a half ago, I found <a href="http://www.davidkanek-9.com/">David Kane\'s website</a> while remembering how influential this song was to me, and I reached out to tell him how much I enjoyed it. We traded several e-mails back and forth and somehow I convinced him to collaborate with me on this track. I\'ve enjoyed our chats and getting to know him better. Truly the best thing to come out of me making this music has already happened, and that was getting to collab with David."</i></p><p>So . . . that catches us up to August 2025 and there\'s been a lot holding me back once again:&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2024/04/whats-happened-where-have-i-been-and.html">Losing my job</a>, moving back to Utah, learning a new career, and <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/07/time-for-real-boss-fight-lung-cancer.html">being diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer</a>. I have lots of ideas for music, but haven\'t pursued them. I\'m stuck once again.</p><p>I\'ll snap out of it soon though. Adam Terry has been chatting me up again about releasing another collection of music -- he\'s just been busy running a local record shop in Salt Lake and pouring his whole life into it.&nbsp; If you\'re in Salt Lake, go checkout <a href="https://fountainrecordsslc.com/">Fountain Records</a>. It\'s a great shop. Support local folks like Adam and his wife, who are both simply awesome.

With Adam\'s help, the hope of actually releasing some old music of mine on his label,&nbsp;<a href="https://fountainavm.com/">FountainAVM</a>, was now a possibility! He asked to hear more of my stuff and I flooded his Dropbox with hours upon hours of old music I had recorded on tape.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s1910/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s320/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" width="251" /></a></div><br /><p>Adam was fantastic! I\'ve never had anyone dump so many hours of their life just dedicated to listening to my music. Honestly, the real help from Adam has been feeling like someone actually cared about me as an artist enough to reach out and help me dust off the old tapes. While there may be a lot of sadness and regret from the past, his simple act of reaching out kind of unplugged so many things that I had bottled up over the years. That alone was appreciated.</p><p>From all that, Adam curated two albums of music.&nbsp; The first was just released last year. <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2024/03/an-ant-survives-rainstorm.html">As discussed in this post</a>:</p><p><i>"My new "old" album was released today by FOUNTAINavm.

A few years ago, I came in contact with Adam Terry from FOUNTAINavm, and he asked if he could listen to my collection of nine, 60-minute-long old audio tapes I had made of unreleased music from my youth.</i></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEih7nwk6yYekPzcyheB1qRwHZ0Jjq5pHTFXCckPwRYSS3NORLd5xwPgAsf9bBxam10_-CpPmCJZTN3WBKgOOpDblGnWv0BVhWwSDw9JSyVmk7RxeTj_j4Lfzr9ZQaKY9JvdVNchxKRG80jnPgK3nIEyhq2a2jsLTSsqouZnPNnxsbfmf5zcsNxCi6RG7Cw/s720/maxresdefault.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEih7nwk6yYekPzcyheB1qRwHZ0Jjq5pHTFXCckPwRYSS3NORLd5xwPgAsf9bBxam10_-CpPmCJZTN3WBKgOOpDblGnWv0BVhWwSDw9JSyVmk7RxeTj_j4Lfzr9ZQaKY9JvdVNchxKRG80jnPgK3nIEyhq2a2jsLTSsqouZnPNnxsbfmf5zcsNxCi6RG7Cw/s320/maxresdefault.jpg" width="319" /></i></a></div><i><br /></i><p><i>Adam selected several songs from the collection, and I poured through my old floppy disks to find these tracks and re-record them for this project . . . MOST of them. A couple songs had been lost to time, and we just made do with the old recordings we had.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Adam curated an interesting selection that\'s different from my usual sound. I\'m happy with the result. I\'ve enjoyed riding around in my car late at night listening to An Ant Survives A Rainstorm and hope you would too.</i></p><p><i>Thanks to FOUNTAINavm for releasing this music and thanks for listening!"</i></p><p>While discussing old music with Adam, we also started discussing new music (well new music to me), and he turned me on to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6R1cNisR3xvk0ivHz13P6E">Minimalist Wave Tapes</a> project, so I started listening to it plus some old formative, meaningful music to me from the 70\'s - 90\'s like Kraftwerk, Boards of Canada, Yaz, Thompson Twins, and the Psychedelic Furs. After baptizing myself in all this music and having recently remade Bit by Bit for my Quarantined Mixes, I realized I could make a synthwave album of my own.</p><p>The end result was Red Pinto Hatchback, released in 2021. I actually made two posts about this one. One about the making of <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/09/red-pinto-hatchback-cover-art.html">the cover art</a>, and one <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/10/red-pinto-hatchback-launched.html">about the album release itself</a>. As I stated in that post:</p><p><i>". . . So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette. Truly, if you have a Walkman, I\'d love to get my music in there for you to enjoy on your new walk down old memory lane.</i></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/s3043/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/w640-h388/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" width="640" /></i></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>No school like the old school</i></p><p><i>I have to talk a bit about the title track to Rotted Leisure Rooms. It\'s a gritty industrial piece that features the synth work of David Kane. Back in 1988 I was watching 120 minutes on MTV when a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DiNYb20WY">Baby Doe Rules</a> by David Kane\'s Decay of the Western Civilization came on, and I recorded it on VHS tape. I asked every record shop I could find in Utah if they had it so I could listen to more, and no one knew what I was talking about.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Eventually I transferred the song off of VHS tape to audio tape so I could listen to it in my car. It was a rare track that no one knew. I think they played Baby Doe Rules only a handful of times late at night on MTV, but there was something about the raw sampled, industrial goodness of this track that in a way gave me permission to do the same. It was truly an inspirational track for me.</i></p><p><i>Just a year and a half ago, I found <a href="http://www.davidkanek-9.com/">David Kane\'s website</a> while remembering how influential this song was to me, and I reached out to tell him how much I enjoyed it. We traded several e-mails back and forth and somehow I convinced him to collaborate with me on this track. I\'ve enjoyed our chats and getting to know him better. Truly the best thing to come out of me making this music has already happened, and that was getting to collab with David."</i></p><p>So . . . that catches us up to August 2025 and there\'s been a lot holding me back once again:&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2024/04/whats-happened-where-have-i-been-and.html">Losing my job</a>, moving back to Utah, learning a new career, and <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/07/time-for-real-boss-fight-lung-cancer.html">being diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer</a>. I have lots of ideas for music, but haven\'t pursued them. I\'m stuck once again.</p><p>I\'ll snap out of it soon though. Adam Terry has been chatting me up again about releasing another collection of music -- he\'s just been busy running a local record shop in Salt Lake and pouring his whole life into it.&nbsp; If you\'re in Salt Lake, go checkout <a href="https://fountainrecordsslc.com/">Fountain Records</a>. It\'s a great shop. Support local folks like Adam and his wife, who are both simply awesome.

Both were named Charly. Well, one was named Charlee (Charl E squared) and Charly. Of course, when I left a review for them, I called them my Charly\'s Angels. OF COURSE I DID. Charl E squared spent a lot of time just listening to me ramble about my story, which I appreciated. She was busy, but she took time to hang with me. She was actually shocked that I didn\'t have any other signs like shortness of breath before I had back pain. (I felt validated in the weirdness of the whole situation.)</p><p>Speaking of back pain, the worst part was an increase in shoulder pain that first week after chemo. I asked the doctor about it, and it may just be that the pain will get worse before it gets better as cells die off and sluff into the fluid around my lungs.&nbsp; It\'s a theory we\'re running with.&nbsp;</p><p>For that first week, there was also a weird taste in my mouth (very metallic or gluey) that kind of messed with the taste of food. Some sweet stuff tasted bitter, and my favorite taco time soft flour tacos tasted bland and gluey.

Charl E squared spent a lot of time just listening to me ramble about my story, which I appreciated. She was busy, but she took time to hang with me.

I\'ve talked a bit about my wonderful distractions like Hogwarts Legacy and Dune, but really, they are just distractions from what\'s really going on with me. Unfortunately, it\'s because I have an actual health issue that\'s hard for me to talk about. I\'ve been putting it off because who wants to talk about cancer?! Ugh. Is there any good time to talk about cancer? probably not. Here we go.</p><p>About 4-5 months ago, I started having some pretty strong shoulder and back pain. At the time I thought I had done something to my shoulder while going <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/03/catching-up-with-friendly-march-2025.html">axe throwing with my church group</a>. What followed was a month of going to the chiropractor to no avail. After a couple trips to the regular doctor and two x-rays later, my doctor recommended I get a CT scan since I had some fluid on my lungs and things looked "worse."</p><p>After the CT scan review, the doctor let me know I had about five masses in my left lung, and one of them looked cancerous. We scheduled a PET scan and sure enough, my left lung lit up like a Christmas tree.</p><p>Next up typically would be a biopsy, but I managed to fast track a fluid drain from my lungs at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake, which verified, yes, this is non-small cell Adenocarcinoma in my lungs. Between that fluid analysis and my PET Scan, my oncology team let me know I\'ve been classified with Stage 4 Lung Cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>No one knows how I got it. Yes, I smoked for a few years back in my early 20\'s, but it\'s been so long ago (30 years) that the doctors say it can\'t be blamed on that. I loved what the doctor said it *could* be blamed on, however: "cosmic radiation and bad luck." That\'s gotta be the name of my next album. (One of the tracks will have to be an experimental noise track featuring ocean waves mixed with the sound of an MRI since that\'s what I chose to listen to while they were scanning my brain.)</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiFwkTuC2Dxv4wnqp9K8X9d9o4teLr1zjGIxNJoWnJh3VQwB7au4_Aa-yvZVFgB7AMo-THzACBLYhJTTyDQP92lWrTrdGUa3kx1-yX6WRTUeVtRYhtUi-_kUAkEMUxDz2_gL3gNS8nkq_XiWHMeb0bYIrFOPiIns3aQ-qJFzqoA6B3MUDWc0BuUaJFtgiI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiFwkTuC2Dxv4wnqp9K8X9d9o4teLr1zjGIxNJoWnJh3VQwB7au4_Aa-yvZVFgB7AMo-THzACBLYhJTTyDQP92lWrTrdGUa3kx1-yX6WRTUeVtRYhtUi-_kUAkEMUxDz2_gL3gNS8nkq_XiWHMeb0bYIrFOPiIns3aQ-qJFzqoA6B3MUDWc0BuUaJFtgiI=w241-h320" width="241" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Brain MRI to fear? Worry not, underdog is here!</i></div></i><p></p><p>As for how long I\'ve had cancer . . . I asked one of the specialists, and she guessed, "six months? a year? hard to say." One thing I remember is back when I had a<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2024/10/a-blaugust-wish-finally-comes-true-in.html"> kidney stone a year and a half ago</a>, the radiologist in the emergency room said they noticed some scarring on my lungs. And that was it. Not, "YO, go get that checked out!" Not, "Hey! This could be cancer!" Nothing. There\'s really no screening for a thing like this unless you\'re "at risk," which I wouldn\'t have been. It\'s a mystery.</p><p>Anyway, the Stage 4 diagnosis has been difficult to process and definitely life altering. Surgery is out as far as options go, it\'s too deep into the lymph nodes and lining of my lung. Average life expectancy is five years with this cancer (some get less, some get more). You can see something different in my face since the news. I almost immediately lost 15-20 pounds (probably due to stress).</p><p>The worst part of this so far has been the pleurisy-like pain. I can no longer put my head on a pillow or lay on my side. Instead, I have to just lay flat on my back and take a bunch of pain meds to get to sleep. If I sneeze, it feels like I\'ve torn a back muscle. I guess the next worse part has simply been considering my mortality and what will happen with my wife and kids if I die. I figured I had 20 more years of work in me and some golden years with my wife.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjW37wunk-8pA5AvLYOLKCyD6tRp90DLNVfGrsL266jv_e1k-5Mddv_8b-POOfU4gYlAUHdLdZG2NnaDSQkHc87AAdcBWAvc43Z6x9teQ1InXY0MN1y1wyVlf1RS5UDv_V4_iqff5RmKuxy_groE151V5eciUOj1esRY_6oCBtxseZ4uSWTF2dg9wHU1BY" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjW37wunk-8pA5AvLYOLKCyD6tRp90DLNVfGrsL266jv_e1k-5Mddv_8b-POOfU4gYlAUHdLdZG2NnaDSQkHc87AAdcBWAvc43Z6x9teQ1InXY0MN1y1wyVlf1RS5UDv_V4_iqff5RmKuxy_groE151V5eciUOj1esRY_6oCBtxseZ4uSWTF2dg9wHU1BY" width="320" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Always playing the support role!</i></div></i><p></p><p>I am hopeful, of course! That could still happen! We\'re still trying to see if there are any genetic markers with my lung cancer that there are known therapies for. A genetic marker like ALK would mean I would have a pill available to me that could extend my life by years. YEARS! I also believe in miracles. I saw so many in just getting me from Texas back to Utah. I can\'t deny my faith. I also have other success stories I can look to. It\'s been my pleasure to trade texts with a local stage 4 colon cancer survivor that was on the brink of death and came back for the win.&nbsp;</p><p>All of that has led me to today . . . besides what was mentioned above, I\'ve now had two biopsies (since the first didn\'t yield results). Yesterday I started chemotherapy. On the upside, the brain MRI was clean, so it hasn\'t spread there. The Second CT scan showed it hasn\'t grown much in the past couple months. So, here goes nothing! I\'m going to fight it with all I\'ve got because even though I shouldn\'t expect a cure with Stage 4 cancer of any kind, it\'s not unheard of to fight cancer and win . . . at least temporarily. They\'re making advances all the time. (and as many of my friends have told me, there are holistic medicine choices to consider). It\'s just . . . a lot.

Unfortunately, it\'s because I have an actual health issue that\'s hard for me to talk about. I\'ve been putting it off because who wants to talk about cancer?! Ugh. Is there any good time to talk about cancer? probably not. Here we go.</p><p>About 4-5 months ago, I started having some pretty strong shoulder and back pain. At the time I thought I had done something to my shoulder while going <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/03/catching-up-with-friendly-march-2025.html">axe throwing with my church group</a>. What followed was a month of going to the chiropractor to no avail. After a couple trips to the regular doctor and two x-rays later, my doctor recommended I get a CT scan since I had some fluid on my lungs and things looked "worse."</p><p>After the CT scan review, the doctor let me know I had about five masses in my left lung, and one of them looked cancerous. We scheduled a PET scan and sure enough, my left lung lit up like a Christmas tree.</p><p>Next up typically would be a biopsy, but I managed to fast track a fluid drain from my lungs at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake, which verified, yes, this is non-small cell Adenocarcinoma in my lungs. Between that fluid analysis and my PET Scan, my oncology team let me know I\'ve been classified with Stage 4 Lung Cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>No one knows how I got it. Yes, I smoked for a few years back in my early 20\'s, but it\'s been so long ago (30 years) that the doctors say it can\'t be blamed on that. I loved what the doctor said it *could* be blamed on, however: "cosmic radiation and bad luck." That\'s gotta be the name of my next album. (One of the tracks will have to be an experimental noise track featuring ocean waves mixed with the sound of an MRI since that\'s what I chose to listen to while they were scanning my brain.)</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiFwkTuC2Dxv4wnqp9K8X9d9o4teLr1zjGIxNJoWnJh3VQwB7au4_Aa-yvZVFgB7AMo-THzACBLYhJTTyDQP92lWrTrdGUa3kx1-yX6WRTUeVtRYhtUi-_kUAkEMUxDz2_gL3gNS8nkq_XiWHMeb0bYIrFOPiIns3aQ-qJFzqoA6B3MUDWc0BuUaJFtgiI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiFwkTuC2Dxv4wnqp9K8X9d9o4teLr1zjGIxNJoWnJh3VQwB7au4_Aa-yvZVFgB7AMo-THzACBLYhJTTyDQP92lWrTrdGUa3kx1-yX6WRTUeVtRYhtUi-_kUAkEMUxDz2_gL3gNS8nkq_XiWHMeb0bYIrFOPiIns3aQ-qJFzqoA6B3MUDWc0BuUaJFtgiI=w241-h320" width="241" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Brain MRI to fear? Worry not, underdog is here!</i></div></i><p></p><p>As for how long I\'ve had cancer . . . I asked one of the specialists, and she guessed, "six months? a year? hard to say." One thing I remember is back when I had a<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2024/10/a-blaugust-wish-finally-comes-true-in.html"> kidney stone a year and a half ago</a>, the radiologist in the emergency room said they noticed some scarring on my lungs. And that was it. Not, "YO, go get that checked out!" Not, "Hey! This could be cancer!" Nothing. There\'s really no screening for a thing like this unless you\'re "at risk," which I wouldn\'t have been. It\'s a mystery.</p><p>Anyway, the Stage 4 diagnosis has been difficult to process and definitely life altering. Surgery is out as far as options go, it\'s too deep into the lymph nodes and lining of my lung. Average life expectancy is five years with this cancer (some get less, some get more). You can see something different in my face since the news. I almost immediately lost 15-20 pounds (probably due to stress).</p><p>The worst part of this so far has been the pleurisy-like pain. I can no longer put my head on a pillow or lay on my side. Instead, I have to just lay flat on my back and take a bunch of pain meds to get to sleep. If I sneeze, it feels like I\'ve torn a back muscle. I guess the next worse part has simply been considering my mortality and what will happen with my wife and kids if I die. I figured I had 20 more years of work in me and some golden years with my wife.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjW37wunk-8pA5AvLYOLKCyD6tRp90DLNVfGrsL266jv_e1k-5Mddv_8b-POOfU4gYlAUHdLdZG2NnaDSQkHc87AAdcBWAvc43Z6x9teQ1InXY0MN1y1wyVlf1RS5UDv_V4_iqff5RmKuxy_groE151V5eciUOj1esRY_6oCBtxseZ4uSWTF2dg9wHU1BY" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjW37wunk-8pA5AvLYOLKCyD6tRp90DLNVfGrsL266jv_e1k-5Mddv_8b-POOfU4gYlAUHdLdZG2NnaDSQkHc87AAdcBWAvc43Z6x9teQ1InXY0MN1y1wyVlf1RS5UDv_V4_iqff5RmKuxy_groE151V5eciUOj1esRY_6oCBtxseZ4uSWTF2dg9wHU1BY" width="320" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Always playing the support role!</i></div></i><p></p><p>I am hopeful, of course! That could still happen! We\'re still trying to see if there are any genetic markers with my lung cancer that there are known therapies for. A genetic marker like ALK would mean I would have a pill available to me that could extend my life by years. YEARS! I also believe in miracles. I saw so many in just getting me from Texas back to Utah. I can\'t deny my faith. I also have other success stories I can look to. It\'s been my pleasure to trade texts with a local stage 4 colon cancer survivor that was on the brink of death and came back for the win.&nbsp;</p><p>All of that has led me to today . . . besides what was mentioned above, I\'ve now had two biopsies (since the first didn\'t yield results). Yesterday I started chemotherapy. On the upside, the brain MRI was clean, so it hasn\'t spread there. The Second CT scan showed it hasn\'t grown much in the past couple months. So, here goes nothing! I\'m going to fight it with all I\'ve got because even though I shouldn\'t expect a cure with Stage 4 cancer of any kind, it\'s not unheard of to fight cancer and win . . . at least temporarily. They\'re making advances all the time. (and as many of my friends have told me, there are holistic medicine choices to consider). It\'s just . . . a lot. Especially right now since it\'s new.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgYeijUBoHVYND9Dm9I8fO5caMD0Bm27Hpn7qKb5xr_OGFI6F_X8B4aAhyX_ZV9zL3KvnrcIKJrkGAEZcP4iRPbNHf_CzzCZO774U7qs6uALES1Ku_WlfMJAJL66UzdonjAsq0Roow07dEBSjLZiBcQuMdXFc9MnTXSbymvv9HSpbl0qHciEZROfm3J4m0" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgYeijUBoHVYND9Dm9I8fO5caMD0Bm27Hpn7qKb5xr_OGFI6F_X8B4aAhyX_ZV9zL3KvnrcIKJrkGAEZcP4iRPbNHf_CzzCZO774U7qs6uALES1Ku_WlfMJAJL66UzdonjAsq0Roow07dEBSjLZiBcQuMdXFc9MnTXSbymvv9HSpbl0qHciEZROfm3J4m0=w275-h320" width="275" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Sending a message to my cancer.</i></div></i><br />I know some will see this post and think, how can I help?

In a lot of ways, Dune Awakening is much like ye\' olde EverQuest in that if you die somewhere, you have to go back to the spot and collect your items you lost.&nbsp; It\'s not quite as punishing, though, because at least you don\'t have to run back naked and afraid.&nbsp; You at least keep your equipped gear on.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimqFND422ifG52t3u5cp7v7qPDCPllAlXrKUq_I0MdKm2eSMlURRliHiGBDXYpBVKs5XoKeO9k7yeciEWEHg8pPGiR_3OTI0OABbXGQzVkXsqRVdE-snQp1Oy6fU6plEGtLqMnPTLVaMutmN4XVf7A2wAFmfUN8OGugbUukk_blbxFDlpYDSV-nReyVCk/s1920/20250627155549_1.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimqFND422ifG52t3u5cp7v7qPDCPllAlXrKUq_I0MdKm2eSMlURRliHiGBDXYpBVKs5XoKeO9k7yeciEWEHg8pPGiR_3OTI0OABbXGQzVkXsqRVdE-snQp1Oy6fU6plEGtLqMnPTLVaMutmN4XVf7A2wAFmfUN8OGugbUukk_blbxFDlpYDSV-nReyVCk/w640-h360/20250627155549_1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Stupid CHOAM Heavy and his stupid Heavy Darts . . .</i></div></i><p>What I think I enjoy most about this game are the small details. Occasionally, large zone-wide sandstorms will kick up and damage anyone who isn\'t sheltered. The other day I was hiding in a little nook of a stone wall to shelter from a storm and turned the camera to look behind me. You could see sand particles sweeping across the rock plateau. What a cool touch! Little, beautiful touches like this are everywhere.</p><p>The combat is surprisingly fun when you have a mix of gunplay and melee. Trying to make a slow dagger strike through armor is so satisfying. In addition, it all just makes sense within the context of the movies (I\'d say books, but I haven\'t read them).</p><p>Overall, I\'ve just really enjoyed my experience in Dune Awakening so far. Up next for me is probably relocating my base closer to a station and pressing on into the fifth spice dream vision.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjv0zzJQYJPF36d1uP7WIQCN5BwypNAE2cRNYK1D-qlc78OqGWTa_dn7oYupKknLvB1eSQxN7RZWpUsZ0S71_d6ECNAF0wz0_otQLz9u3N5B7LaeefT8hKZVfbN3o9TOhetcg2IJbdfy40dSTTO0wFqb_UGQCGYwbepAX991y46wGjacQBknKvzHT0P5vo/s1920/20250706171209_1.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjv0zzJQYJPF36d1uP7WIQCN5BwypNAE2cRNYK1D-qlc78OqGWTa_dn7oYupKknLvB1eSQxN7RZWpUsZ0S71_d6ECNAF0wz0_otQLz9u3N5B7LaeefT8hKZVfbN3o9TOhetcg2IJbdfy40dSTTO0wFqb_UGQCGYwbepAX991y46wGjacQBknKvzHT0P5vo/w640-h360/20250706171209_1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>As the Ninja Turtles would say, "Cowabunga, it\'s spicing time!"</i></div></i><p>Happy Dueling!</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/07/cowabunga-its-spicing-time.html'}], 'link': 'https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/07/cowabunga-its-spicing-time.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Stingite', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Stingite)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Stingite', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaGtGm8NtWfME4t7-PhTOHqD3z6PqpmTyEEJloqRI4rTowzomOowu3m1ErTS18UZvOSwJHtv5jVmfeJ9zN2Q1HDU4kBAXF1hyLMbvBcpUEKgWArI7RcmQJ3EIgzpL3hc-Qnv62dnV6pG1BJSUck0Bjjb_EEkX2YgCOc-ZEhDcw3Vu2Vei6oumI2a2eH98/s72-w640-h360-c/2025072.JPG', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '2'}

At the time, my job was to work closely with an outsourcing team in Spain to build a vertical slice of a mobile game called Unnatural Selection (UNS). The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk. When you do find something that works, you can go all in (as they did with our game <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2022/08/game-portfolio-rpg-dice-heroes-of.html">Dice RPG</a>).</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">When I got wind that we were transitioning to VR, I instantly wanted to try making our UNS mobile game as a VR game (UNSVR!). To that end, I drew up a PowerPoint pitch deck and presented it to our executives. They were interested and happy I had taken that initiative, but they wanted something a bit less risky and strange for our first VR project.&nbsp; I can\'t say I blame them!</span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">Below are a few of the slides from that PowerPoint deck:</span></p><p style="color: #222222; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/s1265/deck1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/w640-h356/deck1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/s1280/deck2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/w640-h358/deck2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/s1291/deck3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/w640-h360/deck3.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/s1920/deck5.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/w640-h360/deck5.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/s1296/deck4.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/w640-h360/deck4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Later, in 2023, WIMO hosted a game jam internally and encouraged all teams to make VR games. Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build.

At the time, my job was to work closely with an outsourcing team in Spain to build a vertical slice of a mobile game called Unnatural Selection (UNS). The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk. When you do find something that works, you can go all in (as they did with our game <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2022/08/game-portfolio-rpg-dice-heroes-of.html">Dice RPG</a>).</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">When I got wind that we were transitioning to VR, I instantly wanted to try making our UNS mobile game as a VR game (UNSVR!). To that end, I drew up a PowerPoint pitch deck and presented it to our executives. They were interested and happy I had taken that initiative, but they wanted something a bit less risky and strange for our first VR project.&nbsp; I can\'t say I blame them!</span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">Below are a few of the slides from that PowerPoint deck:</span></p><p style="color: #222222; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/s1265/deck1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/w640-h356/deck1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/s1280/deck2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/w640-h358/deck2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/s1291/deck3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/w640-h360/deck3.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/s1920/deck5.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/w640-h360/deck5.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/s1296/deck4.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/w640-h360/deck4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Later, in 2023, WIMO hosted a game jam internally and encouraged all teams to make VR games. Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build.

Here’s how.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">The Nadia story</h2>\n    <p>This is a vision of what success looks like.</p>\n    <p>Nadia lives in LA.\n    She has a popular social-media account with a reputation for stylish pictures of urban\n    life. She’s not terribly political, just a talented street photog. Her handle is “CoolTonesLA@hotpix.example”.</p>\n    <p>She’s in Venice Beach the afternoon of Sunday August 9, 2026, when federal agents take down a vendor selling\n    cheap Asian ladies’ wear. She gets a great shot \n    of an enforcer carrying away an armful of pretty dresses while two more bend the merchant over his countertop.\n    None of the agents in the picture are in uniform, all are masked.</p>\n    <p>She signs into her “CoolTonesLA” account on <code>hotpix.example</code> and drafts a post saying “Feds raid Venice\n    Beach”. When she uploads \n    the picture, there’s a pop-up asking “Sign this\n    image?” Nadia knows what this means, and selects “Yes”. By midnight her post has gone viral.</p>\n    <img alt="Content Credentials glyph" class="inline" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/cr.png" />\n    <p>As a result of Nadia agreeing to “sign” the image, anyone who sees her post, whether in a browser or mobile app,  also\n    sees that little “Cr” badge in the photo’s top right corner. \n    When they mouse over it, a little pop-up says something like:</p>\n    <blockquote class="popup"><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Signature is valid.<br />Media was posted by <span class="fakelink">@CoolTonesLA</span><br />on \n    <span class="fakelink">hotpix.example</span><br />at 5:40 PM PDT, August 9th, 2026.</p></blockquote>\n    <p>The links point to Nadia’s feed and her instance’s home page. Following them can give the reader a feeling\n    for what kind of person she is, the nature of her server, and the quality of her work. Most people are inclined to believe the\n    photo is real.</p> \n    <p>Marco is a troublemaker. He grabs Nadia’s photo and posts it to his social-media account with the caption\n    “Criminal illegals terrorize local business. Lock ’em up!”  He’s not technical and doesn’t strip the metadata. Since the\n    picture is already signed, he doesn’t get the “Sign this picture?” prompt.\n    Anyone who sees his post will see the “Cr” badge and mousing over it makes it pretty clear that it isn’t what he says it\n    is. Commenters gleefully point this out.  By the time Marco takes the post down, his credibility is\n    damaged.</p>\n    <p>Maggie is a more technical troublemaker. She sees Marco’s post and likes it, strips the picture’s metadata, and reposts it. \n    When she gets the “Sign this picture?” prompt, she says “No”, so it doesn’t get\n    a “Cr” badge. Hostile commenters accuse her of posting a fake, saying “LOL badge-free zone”. It is less likely that her\n    post will go viral.</p> \n    <p>Miko isn’t political but thinks the photo would be more dramatic if she Photoshopped it to add a harsh dystopian lighting\n    effect. When she reposts her version, the “Cr” badge won’t be there because the pixels have changed.</p>\n    <p>Morris follows Maggie. He grabs the stripped picture and, when he posts it, says “Yes”\n    to signing. In his post the image will show up with the “Cr” and credit it to him, with a “posted” timestamp later than Nadia’s initial\n    post. Now, the \n    picture’s believability will depend on Morris’s. Does he have a credible track record?\n    Also, there’s a chance that someone will notice what Morris did and point out that he stole Nadia’s picture.</p>\n    <p>(In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if people ran programs against the social-network firehose looking for media signed by more than\n    one account, which would be easy to detect.)</p>\n    <p>That’s the Nadia story.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">How it’s done</h2>\n    <p>The rest of this piece explains in some detail how the Nadia story can be supported by technology that\n    already exists, with a few adjustments. If jargon like “PKIX” and “TLS” and “Nginx” is foreign to you, you’re unlikely to\n    enjoy the following. Before you go, please consider: Do you think making the Nadia story come true\n    would be a good investment?</p>\n    <p>I’m not a really deep expert on all the bits and pieces, so it’s possible that I’ve got something wrong. Therefore, this\n    blog piece will be a living document in that I’ll correct any convincingly-reported errors, with the goal that it\n    accurately describes a realistic technical roadmap to the Nadia story.</p>\n    <p>By this time I’ve posted enough times about C2PA that I’m going to assume people know what it is and how it works. For my long,\n    thorough explainer, see\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/10/28/C2PA-Workflows">On C2PA</a>. Or, check out the\n    <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/">Content Credentials Web site.</a></p>\n    <p>Tl;dr: C2PA is a list of assertions about an media object, stored in its metadata, with a digital signature that includes the\n    assertions and the bits of the picture or video.</p>\n    <p>This discussion assumes the use of C2PA and also an in-progress specification from the\n    <a href="https://cawg.io">Creator Assertions Working Group</a> (CAWG) called\n    <a href="https://cawg.io/identity/1.2-draft">Identity Assertion</a>.</p>\n    <p>Not all the pieces are quite ready to support the Nadia story. But there’s a clear path forward to closing each gap.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">“Sign this picture?”</h2>\n    <p>C2PA and CAWG specify many assertions that you can make about a piece of media. For now let’s focus just on what we\n    need for provenance. \n    When the media is uploaded to a social-network service, there are two facts that the server knows,\n    absolutely and unambiguously: Who uploaded it (because they’ve had to sign in) and when it happened.</p>\n    <p>In the current state of\n    the specification drafts, “Who” is the <code>cawg.social_media</code> property from the draft\n    <a href="https://cawg.io/identity/1.2-draft/#vc-credentialsubject-verifiedidentity-type">Identity Assertion spec, section\n    8.1.2.5.1</a>, and “When” is the <code>c2pa.time-stamp</code> property from the\n    <a href="https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_requirements_2">C2PA\n    specification, section 18.17.3</a>.</p>\n    <p>I think these two are all you need for a big improvement in social network  media provenance,\n    so let’s stick with them.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">What key?</h2>\n    <p>Let’s go back to the Nadia story.\n    It needs the Who/When assertions to be digitally signed in a way that will convince a tech-savvy human or a PKIX validation\n    library that the signature could only have been applied by the server at <code>hotpix.example</code>.</p>\n    <p>The C2PA people have been thinking about this. They are working on a\n    <a href="https://iptc.org/verified-news-publishers-list/">Verified News Publishers List</a>, to be maintained and managed by,\n    uh, that’s not clear to me. The idea is that C2PA software would, when validating a digital signature, require\n    that the PKIX cert is one of those on the Publishers List.</p>\n    <p>This isn’t going to work for a decentralized social network, which has tens of thousands of independent servers\n    run by co-ops, academic departments, municipal governments, or just a gaggle of friends who kick in on Patreon. And anyhow,\n    Fediverse instances don’t claim to be “News Publishers”, verified or not.</p>\n    <p>So what key can <code>hotpix.example</code> sign with?\n    Fortunately, there’s already a keypair and PKIX certificate in place on every social-media server, the one it uses to\n    support TLS connections. The one at <code>tbray.org</code>, that’s being used used right now to protect your interaction\n    with this blog, is in <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/</code> and the private key is obviously not generally readable.</p>\n    <p>That cert will contain the public key corresponding to the host’s private key, the cert\'s ancestry, and the host name.\n    It’s all that any PKIX library needs to verify that yes, this could only have been signed by\n    <code>hotpix.example</code>. However, there will be objections.</p>\n    <p><b>Objection</b>: “<code>hotpix.example</code> is not a Verified News Publisher!” True enough, the C2PA validation libraries would\n    have to accept X.509 certs. Maybe they do already? Maybe this requires an extension of the current specs? In any\n    case, the software’s all open-source, could be forked if necessary.</p>\n    <p><b>Objection</b>: “That cert was issued for the purpose of encrypting TLS connections, not for some weird photo provenance\n    application. Look at the\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_identifier">OID</a>!” OK, but seriously, who cares?\n    The math does what the math \n    does, and it works.</p>\n    <p><b>Objection</b>: “I have to be super-careful about protecting my private key and I don’t want to give a copy to the hippies\n    running the social-media server.” I sympathize but, in most cases, social media is all that\n    server’s doing.</p>\n    <p>Having said that, it would be great if there were extensions to Nginx and Apache httpd where you could request\n    that they sign the assertions for you. Neither would be rocket science.</p>\n    <p>OK, so we sign Nadia’s Who/When assertions and her photo’s pixels  with our host’s TLS key, and ship it off into the\n    world. What’s next?</p> \n    <h2 id="p-5">How to validate?</h2>\n    <p>Verifying these assertions, in a Web or mobile app, is going to require a C2PA library to pick apart the assertions and\n    a PKIX library for the signature check.</p>\n    <p>We already have\n    <a href="https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs">c2pa-rs</a>, Rust code with MIT and Apache licenses.\n    Rust libraries can be called\n    from some  other programming languages but in the normal course of affairs I’d expect there soon to be native implementations.\n    Once again, all these technologies are old as dirt, absolutely no rocket science required.</p>\n    <p>How about validating the signatures?  I was initially puzzled about this one because, as a\n    programmer, certs only come into the picture when I do something like <code>http.Get()</code> and the\n    library takes care of all that stuff. So I can’t speak from experience.</p>\n    <p>But I think the infrastructure is there.  Here’s a Curl blogger praising\n    <a href="https://eissing.org/icing/posts/curl-apple-sectrust/">Apple SecTrust</a>. Over on Android, there’s\n    <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/X509ExtendedTrustManager">X509ExtendedTrustManager</a>.\n    I assume Windows has something. And if\n    all else fails, you could just download a trusted-roots file from the\n    <a href="https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html">Curl</a> or\n    <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/ca-certificates/+/master/files/">Android</a> projects and refresh it\n    every week or two.</p> \n    <h2 id="p-7">What am I missing?</h2>\n    <p>This feels a little too easy, something that could be done in months not years. Perhaps I’m oversimplifying.\n    Having said that, I think the most important thing to get right is the scenarios, so we know what effect we want to achieve.</p>\n    <p>What do you think of the Nadia story?</p>'}]}

I would so like to return to\n    arguing about Functional Programming or Free Trade.  This is risky and there’s a pretty good chance that I’m\n    completely wrong. But I’ll try to entertain while prognosticating.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Reverse Centaurs</h2>\n    <p>That’s the title of a\n    <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/commentary-cory-doctorow-reverse-centaurs/">Cory Doctorow</a> essay, which I think is spot\n    on. I’m pretty sure anyone who’s read even this far would enjoy it and it’s not long, and it’d help understand this.\n    Go have a look, I’ll wait.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Hallucinations won’t get fixed</h2>\n    <p>I have one good and one excellent argument to support this prediction. Good first: While my understanding of LLMs is not\n    that deep, it doesn’t have to be to understand that it’s really difficult (as in, we don’t know how) to connect the model’s\n    machinations to our underlying reality, so as to fact-check.</p>\n    <p>The above is my non-expert intuition at work. But then there’s\n    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04664">Why Language Models Hallucinate</a>, three authors from OpenAI and one from Georgia\n    Tech, which seems to show that hallucinations are an inevitable result of current training practices.</p>\n    <p>And here’s the excellent argument: If there were a way to eliminate the hallucinations, <em>somebody already would\n    have</em>. An army of\n    smart, experienced people, backed by effectively infinite funds, have been hunting this white\n    whale for years now without much success. My conclusion is, don’t hold your breath waiting.</p>\n    <p>Maybe there’ll be a surprise breakthrough next Tuesday. Could happen, but I’d be really surprised.</p>\n    <p>(When it comes to LLMs and code, the picture is different; see below.)</p>\n    <h2 id="p-1">The mass layoffs won’t happen</h2>\n    <p>The central goal of GenAI is the elimination of tens of millions of knowledge workers.\n    That’s the only path to the profits that can cover the costs of training and\n    running those models.</p>\n    <p>To support this scenario the AI has to run in Cory’s “reverse centaur” mode, where the models do the work and the\n    humans tend them. This allows the production of several times more work per human, generally of lower quality, with inevitable\n    hallucinations. There are two problems here: First, that at least some of the output is\n    <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity">workslop</a>, whose cleanup costs eat away at\n    the productivity wins.\n    Second, that the lower quality hurts your customers and your business goes\n    downhill.</p>\n    <p>I just don’t see it. Yeah, I know, every CEO is being told that this will work and they’ll be heroes to their\n    shareholders. But the data we have so far keeps refusing to support those productivity claims.</p>\n    <p>OK then, remove the “reverse” and run in centaur mode, where smart humans use AI tools judiciously to improve productivity\n    and quality. Which might be a good idea for some people in some jobs.\n    But in that scenario neither the output boost nor the quality gain get you to where you can dismiss enough\n    millions of knowledge workers to afford the AI bills.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">The financial damage will be huge</h2>\n    <p>Back to Cory, with <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/27/econopocalypse/#subprime-intelligence">The real (economic) AI\n    apocalypse is nigh</a>. It’s good, well worth reading, but at this point pretty well conventional wisdom as seen by everyone who\n    isn’t either peddling a GenAI product or (especially) fundraising to build one.</p>\n    <p>To pile on a bit, I’m seeing things every week like for example this:\n    <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/23/ai-boom-unsustainable-tech-spending-parabolic-deutsche-bank/">The AI boom is\n    unsustainable unless tech spending goes ‘parabolic,’ Deutsche Bank warns: ‘This is highly unlikely’</a>.</p>\n    <p>The aggregate investment is ludicrous. The only people who are actually making money are the ones\n    <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e93e56df-dd9b-40c1-b77a-dba1ca01e473">selling the gold-mining equipment</a> to the peddlers.\n    Like they say,\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Stein#Stein\'s_Law">“If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.”</a> Where\n    by “forever”, in the case of GenAI, I mean “sometime in 2026, probably”.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">… But the economy won’t collapse</h2>\n    <p>Cory forecasts existential disaster, but I’m less worried.\n    Those most hurt when the bubble collapses will be the investing classes who, generally speaking, can afford it. \n    Yeah, if the S&amp;P 500 drops by a third, the screaming will shake the heavens, but I honestly don’t see it hitting as hard as\n    2008 and don’t see how the big-picture economy falls apart. That work that the genAI shills say would be automated away is still\n    gonna have to be done, right?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">The software profession will change, but not <em>that</em> much</h2>\n    <p>Here’s where I get in trouble, because a big chunk of my professional peers, including people I admire, see\n    GenAI-boosted coding as pure poison:\n    <a href="https://anthonymoser.github.io/writing/ai/haterdom/2025/08/26/i-am-an-ai-hater.html">“In a kind of nihilistic symmetry,\n    their dream of the perfect slave machine drains the life of those who use it as well as those who turn the gears.”</a> (The\n    title of that essay is “I Am An AI Hater.”)</p>\n    <p>I’m not a hater.\n    I argued above that LLMs generating human discourse have no way to check their output for consistency with\n    reality. But if it’s code, “reality” is approximated by what will compile and build and pass the tests. The agent-based systems\n    iteratively generate code, reality-check it, and don’t show it to you until it passes. One consequence is that the\n    quality of help you get from the model should depend on the quality of your test framework. Which warms my\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/05/15/Testing-in-2021">testing-fanatic</a> heart.</p>\n    <p>So, my first specific prediction: Generated code will be a routine thing in the toolkit, going forward from here. It’s pretty\n    obvious that LLMs are better at predicting code sequences than human language.</p>\n    <p>In <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer">Revenge of the junior developer</a>, Steve Yegge\n    says, more or less, “Resistance is useless. You will be assimilated.” But he’s wrong; there are going to be places where we\n    put the models to work, and others where we won’t. We don’t know which places those are and aren’t, but I have (weaker)\n    predictions; let’s be honest and just say “guesses”.</p>\n    <p>Where I suspect generated code will likely appear:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>Application logic: “Depreciate the values in the <code>AMOUNT</code> field of the <code>INSTALLED</code> table forward\n      ten years and write the <code>NAME</code> field and the depreciated value into a CSV.” Or “Look at JIRA ticket 248975 and\n      create a fix.”</p>\n      <p>(By the way, this is a high proportion of what actual real-world programmers do every day.)</p></li>\n      <li><p>Glorified StackOverflow-style lookups like I did in\n      <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/01/First-AI-Code">My First GenAI Code</a>.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Drafting code that needs to run against interfaces too big and complex to hold in your head, like for example the\n      Android and AWS APIs (“When I shake the phone, grab the location from GPS and drop it in the <code>INCOMING</code> S3 bucket”). Or\n      CSS (“Render that against a faded indigo background flush right, and hold it steady while scrolling so the text slides around\n      it”).</p></li>\n      <li><p>SQL. This feels like a no-brainer. So much klunky syntax and so many moving pieces.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Where I suspect LLM output won’t help much.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>Interaction design.

Today I represent… nobody, <em>officially</em>. I’m not on any of the committees nor am I an\n    employee of any of the providers. But I’m a photographer and software developer and social-media activist and have written a lot about\n    C2PA. So under all those hats this is a subject I care about.</p>\n    <p>Also, I posted this on Twitter back in 2017.</p>\n    <img alt="Twitter post from 2017 presaging C2pA" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/2017-twitter.png" />\n    <p>I’m not claiming that I was the first with this idea, but I’ve been thinking about the issues for quite a while.</p>\n    <p>Enough self-introduction. Today I’m going to look at C2PA in practice right now in 2025. Then I’m going to talk about what I\n    think it’s for. Let’s start with a picture.</p>\n    <img alt="Picture of a shopping mall storefront" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/L1000004.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>This smaller version doesn’t have C2PA,<br />but if you click on it, the larger version you get does.\n    <br />Photo credit: Rob Pike</p></div>\n    <p>I should start by saying that a few of the things that I’m going to show you are, umm, broken. But I’m still a C2PA fan. Bear\n    in mind that at this point everything is beta or preview or whatever, at best v1.0. I think we’re in glass-half-full mode.</p>\n    <p>This photo is entirely created and processed by off-the-shelf commercial products and has content credentials, and let me say\n    that I had a freaking hard time finding such a photo. There are very few Content Credentials out there on the Internet. That’s\n    because nearly every online photo is delivered either via social media or by professional publishing software. In both cases, the\n    metadata is routinely stripped, bye-bye C2PA. So one of the big jobs facing us in putting Content Credentials to work is to stop\n    publishers from deleting them.</p>\n    <p>Of course, that’s complicated. Professional publishers probably want the Content Credentials in place, but on social media\n    privacy is a key issue and stripping the metadata is arguably a good default choice. So there are a lot of policy discussions to\n    be had up front of the software work.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, let’s look at the C2PA. </p>\n    <img alt="Picture with two Content Credentials glyphs and one drop-down" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/ca-glyphs-1.png" />\n    <p>I open up that picture in Chrome and there are little “Cr” glyphs at both the top left and top right corners; that’s because\n    I’ve installed multiple C2PA Chrome plug-ins. Turns out these seem to only be available for Chrome, which is irritating. Anyhow,\n    I’ve clicked on the one in the top left.</p> \n    <p>That’s a little disappointing. It says the credentials were recorded by Lightroom, and gives my name, but I think it’s hiding\n    way more than it’s revealing. Maybe the one on the top right will be more informative?</p>\n    <img alt="Picture with two Content Credentials glyphs and one drop-down" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/ca-glyphs-2.png" />\n    <p>More or less the same info. A slightly richer presentation But both displays have an “inspect” button and both do the same\n    thing. Let’s click it!</p>\n    <img alt="Content Credentials inspector page, failing to retrieve a page for review" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/broken-inspector.png" />\n    <p>This is the Adobe Content Credentials inspector and it’s broken. That’s disappointing. Having said that, I was in a Discord\n    chat with a senior Adobe person this morning and they’re aware of the problem.</p>\n    <p>But anyhow, I can drag and drop the\n    picture like they say.</p>\n    <img alt="Content credentials as displayed by the Inspector" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/2-phase-c2pa.png" />\n    <p>Much much better. It turns out that this picture was originally taken with a Leica M11-P. The photographer is a famous software\n    guy named Rob Pike, who follows me on Mastodon and wanted to help out.</p>\n    <p>So, thanks Rob, and thanks also to the Leica store in Sydney, Australia, who loaned him the M11. He hasn’t told me how he\n    arranged that, but I’m curious.</p>\n    <p>I edited it in Lightroom, and if you look close, you can see that I cropped it down and brightened it up. Let’s zoom in on\n    the content credentials for the Leica image.</p>\n    <img alt="Leica-generated C2PA display" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/leica-cc.png" />\n    <p>There’s the camera model, the capture date (which is wrong because Rob didn’t get around to setting the camera’s date before\n    he took the picture.) The additional hardware (R-Adapter-M), the dimensions, ISO, focal length, and shutter speed.</p>\n    <p>Speaking as a photographer, this is kind of cool. There’s a problem in that it’s partly wrong. The focal length isn’t zero,\n    and Rob is pretty sure he didn’t have an adapter on. But Leica is trying to do the right thing and they’ll get there.</p>\n    <p>Now let’s look at the assertions that were added by Lightroom.</p>\n    <img alt="Lightroom-generated C2PA display" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/lr-cc.png" />\n    <p>There’s a lot of interesting stuff in here, particularly the provenance. Lightroom lets you manage your identities, using\n    what we call “OAuth flows”, so it can ask Instagram (with my permission) what my Instagram ID is. It goes even further with\n    LinkedIn; it turns out that LinkedIn has an integration with the Clear ID people, the ones who fast-track you at the airport. So\n    I set up a Clear ID, which required photos of my passport, and went through the dance with LinkedIn to link it up, and then with\n    Lightroom so it knew my LinkedIn ID. So to expand, what it’s really saying is: “Adobe says that LinkedIn says that Clear says\n    that the government ID of the person who posted this says that he’s named Timothy Bray”.</p>\n    <p>I don’t know about you, but this feels like pretty strong provenance medicine to me. I understand that the C2PA committee and\n    the\n    <a href="https://cawg.io">CAWG</a> people are re-working the provenance assertions. To them: Please don’t screw this particular\n    style of provenance up.</p>\n    <p>Now let’s look at what Lightroom says it did. It may be helpful to know what I in fact did.</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Cropped the picture down.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Used Lightroom’s “Dehaze” tool because it looked a little cloudy.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Adjusted the exposure and contrast, and boosted the blacks a bit.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Sharpened it up.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>Lightroom knows what I did, and you might wonder how it got from those facts to that relatively content-free\n    description that reads like it was written by lawyers.\n    Anyhow, I’d like to know. Since I’m a computer geek, I used the open-source “c2patool” to dump what the assertions\n    actually are.  I apologize if this hurts your eyes.</p>\n    <p>It turns out that there is way more data in those files than the inspector shows. For example, the Leica claims included 29\n    EXIF values, here are three I selected more or less at random:</p>\n    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p"></span><span class="w">          </span><span class="nt">"exif:ApertureValue"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"2.79917"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">          </span><span class="nt">"exif:BitsPerSample"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"16"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">          </span><span class="nt">"exif:BodySerialNumber"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"6006238"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n</pre></div>\n    <p>Some of these are interesting: In the Leica claims, the serial number. I could see that as a useful provenance claim. Or as a\n    potentially lethal privacy risk. Hmmm.</p>\n        <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p"></span><span class="w">            </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.color_adjustments"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.color_adjustments"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr.value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"60"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Exposure2012"</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="p">}</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">},</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.color_adjustments"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Sharpness"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr.value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"52"</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="p">}</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">},</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.cropped"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr.value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Rotated Crop"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Crop"</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="p">}</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n    <p>And in the Lightroom section, it actually shows exactly what I did, see the sharpness and exposure values.</p> \n    <p>My feeling is that the inspector is doing either too much or too little. At the minimal end you could just say “hand\n    processed? Yes/No” and “genAI? Yes/No”.  For a photo professional, they might like to drill down and see what I actually did. I\n    don’t see who would find the existing presentation useful. There’s clearly work to do in this space.</p>\n    <p>Oh wait, did I just say “AI”? Yes, yes I did. Let’s look at another picture, in this case a lousy picture.</p>\n    <img alt="Picture of an under-construction high-rise behind leaves" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/TXT55638.png" />\n    <p>I was out for a walk and thought the building behind the tree was interesting. I was disappointed when I pulled it up on the\n    screen, but I still liked the shape and decided to try and save it.</p>\n    <img alt="Picture of an under-construction high-rise behind leaves, improved" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/TXT55638-good.png" />\n    <p>So I used Lightroom’s “Select Sky” to recover its color, and “Select Subject” to pull the building details out of the\n    shadows. Both of these Lightroom features, which are pretty magic and I use all the time, are billed as being AI-based. I\n    believe it.</p>\n    <p>Let’s look at what the C2PA discloses.</p>\n    <img alt="Lightroom C2PA assertions with automation AI" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/lr-tower.png" />\n    <p>Having said all that, if you look at the C2PA (or at the data behind it) Lightroom discloses only “Color or Exposure”,\n    “Cropping”, and “Drawing” edits. Nothing about AI.</p>\n    <p>Hmm. Is that OK? I personally think it is, and highlights the distinction between what I’d call “automation” AI and\n    Generative AI. I mean, selecting the sky and subject is something that a skilled Photoshop user could accomplish with a lot of\n    tinkering, the software is just speeding things up. But I don’t know, others might disagree.</p>\n    <p>Well, how about that generative AI?</p>\n    <img alt="Turtle in shallow water, generated by ChatGPT" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/chatgpt.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>Fails <code>c2patool</code> validation, “DigitalSourceType” is <code>trainedAlgorithmicMedia</code></p></div>\n    <img alt="Desktop with decorations, Magic Erase has been applied" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/budai.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>“DigitalSourceType” is <code>compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia</code></p></div>\n    <p>The turtle is 100% synthetic, from ChatGPT, and on the right is a Pixel 10 shot on which I did a few edits including “Magic\n    Eraser”.  Both of these came with Content Credentials; chatGPT’s is actually invalid, but on the glass-half-full front, the\n    Pixel 10’s were also invalid up until a few days ago, then they fixed it. So this stuff does get fixed.</p>\n    <p>I’m happy about the consistent use of C2PA terminology, they are clearly marking the images as genAI-involved.</p>\n    <p>I’m about done talking about the state of the Content Credentials art generally but I should probably talk about this\n    device.</p>\n    <img alt="Blue Pixel 10" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/pixel-10.png" />\n    <p>Because it marks the arrival of Content Credentials on the mass consumer market. Nobody knows how many Pixels Google actually\n    sells but I guarantee it’s a lot more than Leica sells M11’s. And since Samsung tends to follow Google pretty closely, we’re\n    heading for tens then hundreds of millions of C2PA-generating mobile devices. I wonder when Apple will climb on board?</p>\n    <p>Let’s have a look at that C2PA.</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA associated with Magic Eraser image" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/p10-c2pa.png" />\n    <p>This view of the C2PA is from the Google Photos app.  It’s very limited.  In particular, there is nothing in there to support\n    provenance. In fact, it’s the opposite, Google is bending over backward to avoid anything that could be interpreted as breaking the\n    privacy contract by sharing information about the user.</p>\n    <p>Let’s pull back the covers and dig a little deeper. Here are a few notes</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>The device is identified just as “Pixel camera”. There are lots of different kinds of those!</p></li>\n      <li><p>The C2PA inclusion is Not optional!</p></li>\n      <li><p>DigitalSourceType:  <code>computationalCapture</code>\u2028(if no genAI)</p></li>\n      <li><p>Timestamp is “untrusted”</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>The C2PA not being optional removes a lot of UI issues but still, well, I’m not smart enough to have fully thought through\n    the implications. That Digital Source Type looks good and appropriate, and the untrusted-ness of the timestamp is\n    interesting.</p>\n    <p>You notice that my full-workflow examples featured a Leica rather than the Pixel, and that’s because the toolchain is\n    currently broken for me: Neither Lightroom nor Photoshop can handle the P10 C2PA. I’ll skip the details, except to say that\n    Adobe is aware of the bug, a version mismatch, and they say they’re working on it.</p>\n    <p>Before we leave the Pixel 10, I should say that there are plenty of alternate camera apps in Android and iOS, some quite\n    good, and it’d be perfectly possible for them to ship much richer C2PA, notably including provenance, location, and so on.</p>\n    <p>I guess that concludes my look at the current state of the Content Credentials art. Now I’d like to talk about what Content\n    Credentials are for.  To start with, I think it’d be helpful to sort the assertions into three baskets.</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA assertions in Capture, Processing, and Provenance baskets" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/3-baskets-1.png" />\n    <p>Capture, that’s like that Leica EXIF stuff we showed earlier. What kind of camera and lens, what the shooting parameters\n    were. Processing, that’s like the Lightroom report: How was the image manipulated, and by what software. Provenance: Which\n    person or organization produced this?</p>\n    <p>But I think this picture has an important oversimplification, let me fix that.</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA assertion baskets with the addition of GenAI" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/3-baskets-2.png" />\n    <p>Processing is logically where you’d disclose the presence of GenAI.  And in terms of what people practically care about,\n    that’s super important and deserves special consideration.</p>\n    <p>Now I’m going to leave the realm of facts and give you opinions. As for the Capture data there on the left… who cares?\n    Really, I’m trying to imagine a scenario in which anyone cares about the camera or lens or F stop.  I guess there’s an exception\n    if you want to prove that the photo was taken by one of Annie Liebowitz’s cameras, but that’s really provenance.</p>\n    <p>Let’s think about a professional publication scenario. They get photos from photographers, employees or agencies or\n    whatever. They might want to be really sure that the photo was from the photographer and not an imposter. So having C2PA\n    provenance would be nice. Then when the publisher gets photos, they do a routine check of the provenance and if it doesn’t check\n    out, they don’t run the picture without a close look first.</p>\n    <p>They also probably want to check for the “is there genAI?” indicator in the C2PA, and, well, I don’t know what they might do,\n    but I’m pretty sure they’d want to know.</p>\n    <p>That same publisher might want to equip the photos they publish with C2PA, to demonstrate that they are really the ones who\n    chose and provided the media. That assertion should be applied routinely by their content management system.  Which should be\n    easy, on the technology side anyhow.</p> \n    <p>So from the point of view of a professional publisher, provenance matters, and being careful about GenAI matters, and in the\n    C2PA domain, I think that’s all that really matters.</p>\n    <p>Now let’s turn to Social Media, which is the source of most of the images that most people see most days.  Today, all the\n    networks strip all the photo metadata, and that decision involves a lot of complicated privacy and intellectual-property\n    thinking.  But there is one important FACT that they know: For any new piece of media, they know which account uploaded the damn\n    thing, because that account owner had to log in to do it. So I think it’s a no-brainer that IF THE USER WISHES, they can have a\n    Content Credentials assertion in the photo saying “Initially uploaded by Tim Bray at LinkedIn” or whoever at wherever.</p> \n    <p>What we’d like to achieve is that if you see some shocking or controversial media, you’d really want to know who originally\n    posted it before you decided whether you believed it, and if Content Credentials are absent, that’s a big red flag. And if the\n    picture is of the current situation in Gaza, your reaction might be different depending on whether it was originally from an\n    Israeli military social-media account, or the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, or by the BBC, or by\n    igor282356057@popular.online.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, here’s how I see it:</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA assertion baskets inflated according to their relative importance" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/3-baskets-3.png" />\n    <p>So for me, it’s the P and A in C2PA that matter – provenance and authenticity. I think the technology has the potential to\n    change the global Internet conversation for the better, by making it harder for liars to lie and easier for truth-tellers to be\n    believed. I think the first steps that have been taken so far are broadly correct and the path forward is reasonably clear. All\n    the little things that are broken, we can fix ’em.</p>\n    <p>And there aren’t that many things that matter more than promoting truth and discouraging lies.</p>\n    <p>And that’s all, folks.</p>'}]}

This one scenic turn-off has you looking at a big, densely-forested mountainside. \n    It’s more chaotic than our West-Coast temperate rain forests, with many tree species jumbled together.

When I unloaded them on the\n    big outboard screen, I was disappointed with the Fujifilm take, which seemed a little flat and boring; was thinking the Pixel had\n    done better. But then I started feeling uneasy; my memory kept telling me that that mountainside just\n    didn’t include that yellow flavor in the Pixel’s highlights. I mean, those highlights look great, but I’m pretty sure they’re lies.</p>\n    <p>After a while, I edited the Fujifilm version just a teeny bit, gently bumping Lightroom’s “exposure” and “Vibrance” sliders, and\n    I thought what \n    I got was very close to what I remembered. The Pixel photo is entirely un-touched.</p>\n    <p>I’m not sure what to think. Mobile-phone cameras in general and the Pixel in particular proudly boast their “computational\n    photography” and “AI” chops and, yeah, the Pixel produced a photo that it’s hard not to like.</p>\n    <p>And quite a few of the pictures I publish in this space have have been adjusted pretty heavily in Lightroom.

It’s only ten pages long, and that’s\n    with all the IETF boilerplate. It’s written specifically for software and networking people.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">The smoking gun</h2>\n    <p>The badness that 9839 focuses on is “problematic characters”, so let’s start with a painful example of what that means.\n    Suppose you’re designing a protocol that uses JSON and one of your constructs has a <code>username</code> field.\n    Suppose you get this message (I omit all the non-<code>username</code> fields). It’s \n    a perfectly legal JSON text:</p>\n    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>\n  <span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">"username"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"\\u0000\\u0089\\uDEAD\\uD9BF\\uDFFF"</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>    </pre></div>\n    <p>Unpacking all the JSON escaping gibberish reveals that the value of the <code>username</code> field contains four \n    numeric “code points” identifying Unicode characters:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>The first code point is zero, in Unicode jargon <code>U+0000</code>. In human-readable text it\n      has no meaning, but it will interfere with the operation of certain programming languages.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Next is Unicode <code>U+0089</code>, official name “CHARACTER TABULATION WITH JUSTIFICATION”. It’s what Unicode calls a\n      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes">C1\n      control code</a>, inherited from ISO/IEC 6429:1992, adopted from \n      <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_5th_edition_june_1991.pdf">ECMA 48</a> (1991), which calls it\n      “HTJ” and says: <i>HTJ causes the contents of the active field (the field in the presentation component that contains the\n      active presentation position) to be shifted forward so that it ends at the character position preceding the\n      following character tabulation stop. The active presentation position is moved to that following character\n      tabulation stop. The character positions which precede the beginning of the shifted string are put into the\n      erased state.</i></p>\n      <p>Good luck with that.</p></li>\n      <li><p>The third code point, <code>U+DEAD</code>, in Unicode lingo, is an “unpaired surrogate”.  To understand,\n      you’d have to learn how Unicode’s much-detested\n      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF-16</a> encoding works.\n      I recommend not bothering.</p>\n      <p>All you need to know is that surrogates are only meaningful when they come in pairs in UTF-16 encoded text. There is\n      effectively no such text on the wire and thus no excuse for tolerating surrogates in your data. In fact, the UTF-8 specification\n      says that you mustn’t use UTF-8 to encode surrogates. But the real problem is that different libraries in different\n      programming languages don’t always do the same things when they encounter this sort of fœtid interloper.</p>    </li>\n      <li><p>Finally, <code>\\uD9BF\\uDFFF</code> is JSON for the code point <code>U+7FFFF</code>.\n      Unicode has a category called “noncharacter”, containing a few dozen code points that, for a variety of\n      reasons, some good, \n      don’t represent anything and must not be interchanged on the wire. <code>U+7FFFF</code> is one of those.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>The four code points in the example are all clearly problematic. \n    The just-arrived RFC 9839 formalizes the notion of “problematic” and\n    offers easy-to-cite language saying which of these problematic types you want to\n    exclude from your text fields. Which, if you’re going to use JSON, you should probably do.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Don’t blame Doug</h2>\n    <p>Doug Crockford I mean, the inventor of JSON.  If he (or I or really anyone careful) were inventing JSON now that Unicode is\n    mature, he’d have been fussier about its character repertoire. Having said that, we’re stuck with JSON-as-it-is forever, so we\n    need a good way to say which of the problematic characters we’re going to exclude even if JSON allows them.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">PRECISion</h2>\n    <p>You may find yourself wondering why the IETF waited until 2025 to provide help with Bad Unicode.\n    It didn’t; here’s\n    <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8264.html">RFC 8264</a>: <cite>PRECIS Framework: Preparation, Enforcement, and\n    Comparison of Internationalized Strings in Application Protocols</cite>; the first PRECIS predecessor was published in 2002.\n    8264 is 43 pages long, containing a <em>very</em>\n    thorough discussion of many more potential Bad Unicode issues than 9839 does.</p>\n    <p>Like 9839, PRECIS specifies subsets of the Unicode character repertoire and goes further, providing a mechanism for defining\n    more.</p>\n    <p>Having said that, PRECIS doesn’t seem to be very widely used by people who are defining new data structures and protocols. My\n    personal opinion is that there are two problems which make it hard to adopt. First, it’s large and \n    complex, with many moving parts, and requires careful study to understand. Developers are (for good reason) lazy.</p>\n    <p>Second, using PRECIS ties you to a specific version of Unicode. In particular, it forbids the use of the (nearly a million)\n    unassigned code points. Since each release of Unicode includes new code point assignments, that means that a sender and receiver\n    need to agree on exactly which version of Unicode they’re both going to use if they want reliably interoperable behavior. This\n    makes life difficult for anyone writing a general-purpose code designed to be used in lots of different applications.</p>\n    <p>I personally think that the only version of Unicode anybody wants to use is “as recent as possible”, so they can be confident\n    of having all the latest emojis.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, 9839 is simpler and dumber than PRECIS. But I think some people will find it useful and now the IETF agrees.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">Source code</h2>\n    <p>I’ve written a little Go-language library to validate incoming text fields against each of the three subsets that 9839\n    specifies,\n    <a href="https://github.com/timbray/RFC9839">here</a>.  I don’t claim it’s optimal, but it is well-tested.</p>\n    <p>It doesn’t have a version number or release just yet, I’ll wait till a few folk have had a chance to spot any dumb mistakes I\n    probably made.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-9">Details</h2>\n    <p>Here’s a compact summary of the world of problematic Unicode code points and data formats and standards.</p>\n    <table>\n      <tr align="center" valign="top"><td class="empty"></td><th colspan="3">Problematic classes excluded?</th></tr>\n      <tr valign="top"><td class="empty"></td><th>Surrogates</th><th>Legacy controls</th><th>Noncharacters</th></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>CBOR</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>I-JSON</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="happy">yes</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>JSON</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>Protobufs</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>TOML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>XML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="neutral">partial [1]</td><td class="neutral">partial [2]</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>YAML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="neutral">mostly [3]</td><td class="neutral">partial [2]</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center" valign="top"><td class="empty"></td><th colspan="3">RFC 9839 Subsets</th></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>Scalars</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>XML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="neutral">partial</td><td class="neutral">partial</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>Assignables</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="happy">yes</td></tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>Notes:</p>\n    <p><b>[1]</b> XML allows C1 controls.</p>\n    <p><b>[2]</b> XML and YAML don’t exclude the noncharacters outside the Basic Multilingual Pane.</p>\n    <p><b>[3]</b> YAML excludes all the legacy controls except for the mostly-harmless <code>U+0085</code>, another version of\n    <code>\\n</code> used in IBM mainframe documents.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">Thanks!</h2>\n    <p>9839 is not a solo production.

My sincere thanks go to my\n    co-editor Paul Hoffman and to all those mentioned in the RFC’s “Acknowledgements” section.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">On individual submissions</h2>\n    <p>9839 is the second “individual submission” RFC I’ve pushed through the IETF (the other is\n    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7725">RFC 7725</a>, which registers the HTTP 451 status code).  While it’s nice\n    to decide something is worth standardizing and eventually have that happen, it’s really a lot of work. Some of that work is\n    annoying.</p>\n    <p>I’ve been involved in\n    other efforts as Working-Group member, WG chair, and WG specification editor, and I can report authoritatively that creating an\n    RFC the traditional way, through a Working Group, is easier and better.</p>\n    <p>I feel discomfort advising others not to follow in my footsteps, but in this case I think it’s the right advice.</p>'}]}

Then I ran across the 2019 book\n    <a href="https://www.biblioasis.com/shop/non-fiction/bush-runner-the-life-and-times-of-pierre-esprit-radisson/">Bush Runner:\n    The Adventures of Pierre-Esprit Radisson</a> and, wow… The writing is pedestrian but who cares because what a\n    story! Radisson lived an absolutely astonishing life. He went as deep into the bush as anyone of his era, interacted intensely\n    with the indigenous people as business partner, friend, and foe, worked for Charles of England and Louis of France (changing\n    sides several times), in 1670 founded the Hudson’s Bay Company (recently, 355 years later, deceased), and fortunately took\n    notes, a copy of which was preserved by Samuel Pepys.</p>\n    <p>I learned more from this book’s pages about the early history of Upper and Lower Canada than all those elementary-school\n    units had to offer, and had loads of fun doing so.  I guess this is a fairly Canadian-specific Long Link, but I think anyone\n    interested in the early history of Europeans in North America would find much to enjoy.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Music</h2>\n    <p>It’s rare these days that I discover interesting new musicians, but here are two of those rarities.</p>\n    <p><a href="https://luciehorsch.com">Lucie Horsch</a> plays recorder, you know, the cheap plastic thing they use to introduce\n    second-graders to music. It’s actually a lovely instrument and I wish we would switch to its German name, \n    “Blockflöte”, which to my ear sounds a bit like the instrument does. Anyhow, check out this YouTube entitled only\n    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJyl2D16PZY&amp;list=RDLJyl2D16PZY&amp;start_radio=1">Lucie Horsch\xa0-\xa0Bach</a>,\n    annoyingly omitting any mention of <em>which</em> Bach. Annoyance aside, it’s a pretty great performance, Ms Horsch is the real\n    deal, full of virtuosity and grace.</p>\n    <p>I got an unusual mid-week message from Qobuz, all excited about \n    <a href="https://transgressiverecords.com/artist/the-new-eves/">The New Eves’</a> new record <cite>The New Eve Is\n    Rising</cite>. So I played it in the car on a long crosstown drive and now I’m all excited too. The New Eves are\n    talented, musically surprising, and above all, insanely brave.</p>\n    <p>Their music doesn’t sound like anything else and\n    flies in the face of all conventional wisdom concerning popular music. They take absurd chances and yeah, the album has klunkers\n    amid the bangers, but when I got to its end I went back and started at the beginning again. I found myself\n    smiling ear-to-ear over and over.

But increasingly, using Google apps feels like being in enemy territory. And, as I said last time, I\n    will not be sorry to shake the dust of Google Drive and Docs from my heels, I find them clumsy and am \n    always having trouble finding something that I know is in there.</p>\n    <p>While I haven’t dug in seriously yet, I keep hearing reasonably-positive things about Proton, and nothing substantive to\n    scare me away.  Wish us luck.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-17">Data sharing (progress!)</h2>\n    <p>Dropbox is, eh, OK. It doesn’t seem actively evil, there’s no advertising, and the price is low.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-21">Photos</h2>\n    <p>We’re a four-Android family including a couple of prolific photographers, and everything just gets pumped into Google and\n    then it fills up and then they want more money.  If we could configure the phones to skip Google and go straight to Dropbox,\n    that would be a step forward.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-16">Video meetings</h2>\n    <p>Google meet isn’t painful but I totally suspect it of data-mining what should be private conversations. I’m getting the\n    feeling that the technical difficulty of videoconferencing is going steadily down, so I’m reasonably optimistic that\n    something a little less evil will come along with a fair price.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-10">Maps</h2>\n    <p>The fear and loathing that \n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/06/29/Fear-Google-Reviews">I started feeling in 2017</a> grows only stronger.  But replacements\n    aren’t obvious.\n    It’s a pity, maps\n    and directions and reviews feel like a natural monopoly that should be a public utility or something, rather than a corporate moat.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Browser (progress!)</h2>\n    <p>Chrome has seriously started making my flesh crawl; once again, enemy territory. Fortunately, there are lots of good options.\n    Even people like us who have multiple lives we need to keep separate can find enough better browsers out there.</p>\n    <p>Maybe I’ll have a look at one of the new genAI-company browsers ha ha just kidding.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-12">Search</h2>\n    <p>The reports on Kagi keep being positive and giving it a try is definitely on the To-Do list.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">Chat</h2>\n    <p>Signal is the only sane choice at this point in history for personal use.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Photo editing</h2>\n    <p>Adobe’s products are good, and I’m proficient and happy with Lightroom, but they are definitely suffering from bad genAI\n    craziness. Also the price is becoming unreasonable.</p>\n    <p>I’ve had a few Lightroom software failures in recent months and if that\n    becomes a trend, looking seriously at the alternatives will move to the top of the priority list.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">In-car interface</h2>\n    <p>It’s tough, Android Auto is a truly great product. I think I’m stuck here for now, particularly given that I plan to be\n    driving a <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/The%20World/Jaguar%20Diary/">2019-model-year car</a> for the foreseeable future. Also, it\n    supports my music apps.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-9">Discover music and play mine (progress!)</h2>\n    <p>Progress here. I’ve almost completely stopped using YouTube Music in favor of Plex and Qobuz. Really no downside; YTM has\n    more or less completely lost the ability to suggest good new stuff.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-13">TV</h2>\n    <p>Video continues morphing itself into Cable TV redux. We have an old Roku box that works fine and I think I’ve managed to find\n    its don’t-spy-on-us settings. We’ll keep subscribing to Apple+ as long as they keep shipping great shows.  I have zero regrets\n    about having\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/03/06/Canceled-Prime">left Prime behind</a>.</p>\n    <p>As for the rest, we’ve become migrants,\n    exclusively month-at-a-time subscriptions for the purpose of watching some serial or sports league, unsubscribe after the season\n    finale or championship game. The good news is that I\n    haven’t encountered much friction in unsubscribing, just a certain amount of earnest pleading.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-20">Looking forward</h2>\n    <p>I have yet to confront any of the really hard parts of this project, but the sense of urgency is increasing. Let’s see.</p>'}]}

This ramble doesn’t exactly have a smooth story arc but I’m\n    posting it anyhow because I know there are people\n    out there interested in state-machine engineering and they are my people.</p>\n    <p>As far as I can tell, a couple of the problems I’m trying to solve\n    haven’t been addressed before, at least not by anyone who published their findings.\n    Partly because of that, I’m starting to wonder if all\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/Technology/Quamina%20Diary/">these disorderly Quamina postings</a> might\n    be worked into a small book or monograph or something. State machines are really freaking useful software constructs!\n    So yeah, this is a war story not an essay, but if you like finite automata you’ll likely be interested in bits of it.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-1">The story thus far</h2>\n    <p>Prior to beginning work on Regular Expressions, I’d already wired shell-style “<code>*</code>” wildcards into Quamina, which\n    forced me to start working with NFAs and ε-transitions. The implementation wasn’t crushingly difficult, and\n    the performance was… OK-ish.</p>\n    <p>Which leads me to The Benchmark From Hell.\n    I wondered how the wildcard functionality would work under heavy stress, so I pulled in a list of 12,959 five-letter strings\n    from the Wordle source code, and inserted a “<code>*</code>” at a random position in each. Here are the first ten:</p>\n    <blockquote><pre><code>aalii*\n*aargh\naar*ti\nabaca*\na*baci\na*back\nab*acs\nab*aft\nabak*a</code></pre></blockquote>\n    <p>I created an NFA for each and merged them together\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/07/28/Union-of-Finite-Automata">as described here</a>. Building and merging the automata were\n    plenty fast enough, and the merged NFA had 46,424 states, which felt reasonable.\n    Matching strings against it ran at under ten thousand per second, which is pretty poor given that Quamina can do a million or\n    two per second on patterns encoded in a DFA.</p>\n    <p>But, I thought, still reasonably usable.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">The cursed “<code>?</code>”</h2>\n    <p>Last year, my\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/12/12/Quamina-Regular-Expression-Series">slow grind through the regexp features</a> had led me\n    to the zero-or-one quantifier “<code>?</code>”.  The state machine for these things is not rocket science; there’s a discussion\n    with pictures in my recent\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Epsilon-Wrangling#p-3">Epsilon Wrangling</a>.</p>\n    <p>So I implemented that and fired off the unit tests, most of which\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/12/12/QRS-Parsing-Regular-Expressions#p-1">I didn’t have to write</a>, and they all failed.\n    Not a surprise I guess.</p>\n    <p>It turned out that the way I’d implemented ε-transitions for the wildcards\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/07/28/Union-of-Finite-Automata#p-9">was partially wrong</a>, as in it worked for the tight-loop\n    state-to-itself ε-transitions, but not for more general-purpose things like “<code>?</code>” requires.</p>\n    <p>In fact, it turns out that merging NFAs is hard (DFAs are easy), and I found precious little help online.\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson%27s_construction">Thompson’s construction</a> does give an answer: Make an\n    otherwise-empty state with two ε-transitions, one to each of the automata, and it’ll do the right thing. Let’s call that\n    a “splice state”. It’s easy to implement, so I did. Splicing is hardly “merging” in the Quamina sense, but still.</p>\n    <p>Unfortunately, the performance was hideously bad, just a few matches per second while pegging the CPU.\n    A glance at the final NFA was sobering; endless chains of splice states, some thousands long.</p>\n    <p>At this point\n    I became very unhappy and got stalled for months dealing with real-life issues while this problem lurked at the back\n    of my mind, growling for attention occasionally.</p>\n    <p>Eventually I let the growler out of the cave and started to think through approaches. But first…</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Worth solving?</h2>\n    <p>Is it, really? What sane person is going to want to search for the union of thousands of regular expressions in general or\n    wild-carded strings in particular?</p>\n    <p>I didn’t think about this problem at all, because of my experience with Quamina’s parent,\n    <a href="https://github.com/aws/event-ruler">Ruler</a>. When it became popular among several AWS and Amazon teams, people\n    sometimes found it useful to match the union of not just thousands but a million or more different patterns. When you write\n    software that anyone actually uses, don’t expect the people using it to share your opinions on what is and isn’t\n    reasonable. So I wasn’t going to get any mental peace until I cracked this nut.</p>\n    <p>I eventually decided that three approaches were worth trying:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Figure out a way really to merge, not just splice, the wildcarded patterns, to produce a simpler automaton.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Optimize the NFA-traversal code path.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Any NFA can be transformed into a DFA, says computer-science theory. So do that, because Quamina is really fast at\n      DFA-based matching.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <h2 id="p-5">Nfa2Dfa</h2>\n    <p>I ended up doing all of these things and haven’t entirely given up on any of them.\n    The most intellectually-elegant was the transform-to-DFA approach, because if I did that, I could remove the fairly-complex\n    NFA-traversal logic from Quamina.</p>\n    <p>It turns out that the Net is rich with textbook extracts and YouTubes and slide-shows about how to do the NFA-to-DFA\n    conversion. It ended up being quite a pleasing little chunk of code, only a couple hundred lines.</p>\n    <p>The bad news: Converting each individual wildcard NFA to a DFA was amazingly fast, but then as I merged them in one by one,\n    the number of automaton states started increasing explosively and the process slowed down so much that I never had the patience\n    to let it finish. Finite-automata theory warns that this can happen, but it’s hard to characterize the cases where it does.\n    I guess this one of them.</p>\n    <p>Having said that, I haven’t discarded the <code>nfa2Dfa</code> code, because perhaps I ought to offer a Quamina option to\n    apply this if you have some collection of patterns that you want to run really super fast and are willing to wait for a while\n    for the transformation process to complete. Also, I may have missed opportunities to optimize the conversion; maybe it’s making\n    more states than it needs to?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Faster NFA traversal</h2>\n    <p>Recently in\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Epsilon-Wrangling">Epsilon wrangling</a> I described how NFA traversal has to work,\n    relying heavily on implementing a thing called an ε-closure.</p>\n    <p>So I profiled the traversal process and discovered, unsurprisingly, that most of the time was going into memory allocation\n    while computing those ε-closures. So now Quamina has an ε-closure cache and will only compute each one once.</p>\n    <p>This helped a lot but not nearly enough, and the profiler was still telling me the pain was in Go’s allocation and\n    garbage-collection machinery. Whittling away at this kind of stuff is not rocket science. The standard Go trick I’ve seen over\n    and over is to keep all your data in slices, keep re-using them then chopping them back to <code>[:0]</code>\n    for each request.  After a while they’ll have grown to the\n    point where all the operations are just copying bytes around, no allocation required.</p>\n    <p>Which also helped, but the speed wasn’t close to what I wanted.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">Merging wildcard automata</h2>\n    <p>I coded multiple ways to do this, and they kept failing. But I eventually found a way to build those\n    automata so that any two of them, or any one of them and a DFA, can merged and generate dramatically\n    fewer ε-transition chains.  I’m not going to write this up here for two reasons: First of all, it’s not <em>that</em>\n    interesting, and second, I worry that I may have to change the approach further as I go on implementing new regxp operators.</p>\n    <p>In particular, at one point I was looking at the code while it wasn’t working, and I could see that if I added a particular\n    conditional it would work, but I couldn’t think of a principled reason to do it. Obviously I’ll have to sort this out\n    eventually. In the meantime, if you’re the sort of um special person who is now burning with curiosity, check out my branch from\n    that PR and have a look at the <code>spinout</code> type.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, I added that conditional even though it puzzled me a bit, and now you can add wildcard patterns to Quamina at 80K/second,\n    and my 12.9K wildcards generate an NFA with with almost 70K states, which can scan events at almost 400K/second. And that’s good\n    enough to ship the <code>“?”</code> feature.</p>\n    <p>By the way, I tried feeding that 70K-state automaton to the DFA converter, and gave up after it’d burned an hour of CPU and\n    grown to occupy many GB of RAM.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">Next steps</h2>\n    <p>Add “<code>+</code>” and “<code>*</code>”, and really hope I don’t have to redesign the NFA machinery again.</p>\n    <p>Also, figure out the explanation for that puzzling <code>if</code> statement.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-9">And I should say…</h2>\n    <p>Despite the very narrow not to say obsessive focus of this series, I’ve gotten a few bits and pieces of positive feedback. So\n    there are a few people out there who care about this stuff. To all of you, thanks.</p>'}]}

Her right arm was\n    swollen, bruised, and painful. The skin and adjacent blood vessels of very old people become thin and fragile; her whole\n    forearm was a bruise. I tried to get her to go to Emergency but she wasn’t having any of it: “You wait for hours and then they\n    give you a pain-killer, which is constipating.”  Since she could twist her wrist and wiggle her fingers and give my hand a firm\n    grasp, I didn’t push too hard.</p>\n    <p>A couple days later on Saturday she got her regular twice-a-week visit from the public\n    <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/health/accessing-health-care-services/care-at-home-and-outside-the-hospital/home-care">HomeCare</a>\n    nurse, a friendly and highly competent Nigerian immigrant, to check her meds and\n    general condition.\n    She looked at Mom’s wrist and said “Get her an appointment with her doctor, they’ll probably want an X-Ray.”</p>\n    <p>I called up her doctor at opening time Monday. The guy who answered the phone said\n    “Don’t have any appointments for a couple weeks but come on over, we’ll squeeze her in.” So we went in after morning coffee and\n    waited less than an hour.\n    The doctor looked at her arm for 45 seconds and said “I’m writing a prescription for an X-Ray” and there was a\n    radiologist around the corner and she was in ten minutes later. The doctor called me back that afternoon and said “Your\n    mother’s got a broken wrist, I got her an 8AM appointment tomorrow at Regina General’s Cast Clinic.”</p>\n    <p>The doctor at the clinic looked at her wrist for another 45 seconds and said “Yeah, put on a cast” so they did and we were\n    home by ten. I’d pessimistically overpaid a couple bucks for hospital parking.</p>\n    <p>The reason I’m including this is because I notice that this space has plenty of American readers. Did you notice that the\n    story entirely omits insurance companies and money (except parking)? In Canada your health-care comes with your taxes (granted,\n    higher than Americans’) and while the system is far from perfect, it can fix up an old lady’s broken wrist pretty damn fucking\n    quick without any bureaucratic bullshit. Also, Canada spends a huge amount less per head on health-care than the US does.</p>\n    <p>And Mom told me not to forget that Saskatchewan is the birthplace of Canadian single-payer universal healthcare.\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Douglas">Tommy Douglas</a>, the Social Democrat who made that happen, has been\n    named\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_Canadian">The Greatest Canadian</a>.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Gentle surface</h2>\n    <p>Oh, did I say “flat and brown and empty”? Wrong, wrong, and wrong. The Prairies, in Canada and the US too, have textures and\n    colors and hills and valleys, it’s just that the slopes are gentle.  There are really flat parts and they make farmers’ lives easier, but\n    more or less every square inch that’s not a town or a park is farmed.\n    I took Mom for a drive out in the country southeast of Regina, from whence these views:</p>\n    <img alt="A road leading slightly uphill, brilliant yellow canola on both sides" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/TXT55698.png" />\n    <img alt="Yellow canola flowers under a blue sky" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/TXT55700.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>Note that in both shots we’re looking up a gentle slope. In the second, there’s farm infrastructure on\n    the distant horizon.<br />Also consider the color of the sky.</p></div>\n    <p>In Canada that yellow-flowering crop is called “Canola”, which Wikipedia claims refers to a particular cultivar of \n    <i>Brassica napus</i>, commonly known as rapeseed or just rape, so you can see why when Canada’s\n    agribiz sector wanted to position its oil as the thing to use while cooking they went for the cultivar not the species\n    name. I’m old enough to remember when farmers still said just “rapeseed”. Hmm, Wikipedia also claims that the OED claims this:\n    The term “rape” derives from the Latin word for turnip, <i>rāpa</i> or <i>rāpum</i>, cognate with the Greek word ῥάφη,\n    <i>rhaphe</i>.</p>\n    <p>Let’s stick with canola.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Pixelated color</h2>\n    <p>After I’d taken those two canola-field shots I pulled out my Pixel and took another, but I’m not gonna share it because the\n    Pixel decided to turn the sky from what I thought was a complex and interesting hue into its opinion of “what a blue sky looks\n    like” only this sky didn’t.</p>\n    <p>Maybe it’s just me, but I think Google’s camera app is becoming increasingly opinionated about color, and not in a good\n    way. There are plenty of alternative camera apps, I should check them out.</p>\n    <p>In case it’s not obvious, I love photographing Saskatchewan and think it generally looks pretty great, especially when you\n    look up. On the province’s license plates it says “Land of living skies”, and no kidding.</p> \n    <img alt="Saskatchewan’s living skies" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250704_032320050.png" />\n    <img alt="Saskatchewan’s living skies" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250704_032334240.png" />\n    <img alt="Saskatchewan’s living skies" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/TXT55717.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>The first two are from the park behind Mom’s place,<br />the third from that mini-mountain mentioned\n    above.</p></div>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Experience and memory</h2>\n    <p>My Mom’s doing well for a nonagenerian. She’s smart. When I visited early last fall and we talked about the US election I was\n    bullish on Kamala Harris’s chances. She laughed at me and said “The Americans won’t elect a woman.” Well then.</p>\n    <p>But she’s forgetful in the short term. I took her to the Legislature’s\n    garden and to the top of the mini-mountain and for a drive out in the country and another adventure we’ll get to; she\n    enjoyed them all. But maybe she won’t remember them.</p>\n    <p>“Make memories” they say, but what if you show someone you love a good time and maybe they won’t remember it the\n    next day? I’m gonna say it’s still worthwhile and has a lesson to teach about what matters. There endeth the lesson.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">The gallery</h2>\n    <p>Indigenous people make up 17% of Regina’s population, the highest share in any significant Canadian city. By “indigenous” I\n    mean the people that my ancestors stole the land from.  It’s personal with me; Around 1900, my Dad’s family, Norwegian\n    immigrants, took over some pretty\n    great farmland southeast of Edmonton by virtue of “homesteading”, such a <em>nice</em> word isn’t it?</p>\n    <p>Regina tries to honor its indigenous heritage and my favorite expression of that is its\n    <a href="https://mackenzie.art">Mackenzie Art Gallery</a>, a lovely welcoming space in the\n    <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/directory?ou=a8e54600-77d6-4b7e-9702-f07a3dac1b47">T.C.Douglas building</a> (for\n    “T.C.” read “Tommy”. (Did I mention him?) Mom and I walked around it and had lunch in its very decent café.</p>\n    <p>Every time I’ve been there the big exhibitions in the big rooms have been indigenous-centered, and generally excellent.\n    I try to go every time I visit and I’ve never been disappointed.</p>\n    <img alt="Indigenous art at Regina’s Mackenzie Gallery" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250708_172437441.png" />\n    <p>In 2025, anything I have to say about this piece would be superfluous.</p>\n    <img alt="Every American Flag Is A Warning Sign" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250708_173041377.png" />\n    <p>I love modern-art galleries, especially with big rooms full of big pieces, even if I don’t like all the art.\n    Because it feels good to be in the presence of the work of people who are pouring out\n    what they have to offer, especially at large scale. If the task wasn’t hard enough that failures\n    are common then it wouldn’t be worthwhile, would it?</p>\n    <p>They’re especially great when there’s someone I love there enjoying it with me. Here’s Mom.</p>\n    <img alt="Jean Bray considers indigenous art" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250708_172836385.png" />\n    <p>These days, any visit might be the last.

A commenter pointed out that the definition of “epsilon”\n    in that piece is not quite right per standard finite-automata theory, but it’s still a useful in that it describes how\n    epsilons support constructs like the shell-style “<code>*</code>”.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Background</h2>\n    <p>Finite automata come in two flavors: Deterministic (DFA) and Nondeterministic (NFA).  DFAs move from state to state one input\n    symbol at a time: it’s simple and easy to understand and to implement.\n    NFAs have two distinguishing characteristics: First, when you’re in a\n    state and an input symbol arrives, you can transfer to more than one other state. Second, a state can have “epsilon transitions”\n    (let’s say “ε” for epsilon), which can happen any time at all while you’re in that state, input or no input.</p>\n    <p>NFAs are more complicated to traverse (will discuss below) but you need them if you want to\n    implement regular expressions with <code>.</code> and <code>?</code> and <code>*</code> and so on. You can turn any NFA into a\n    DFA, and I’ll come back to that subject in a future piece.</p>\n    <p>For implementing NFAs, I’ve been using\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson%27s_construction">Thompson\'s construction</a>, where\n    “Thompson” is\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>, co-parent of Unix. This technique is also nicely\n    described by Russ Cox in \n    <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast</a>. You don’t need to\n    learn it to understand this piece, but I’ll justify design\n    choices by saying “per Thompson”.</p>\n    <p>I’m going to discuss two specific issues today, ε-closures and a simpler NFA definition.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">ε-closures</h2>\n    <p>To set the stage, consider this regexp: <code>A?B?C?X</code></p>\n    <p>It should match “X” and “BX” and “ACX” and so on, but not “CAX” or “XX”.\n    Thompson says that you implement <code>A?</code> with a\n    transition to the next state on “A” and another ε-transition to that next state; because if you see an “A” you should transition,\n    but then you can transition anyhow even if you don’t.</p>\n    <p>The resulting NFA looks like this:</p>\n    <img alt="NFA matching A?B?C?X" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/AcmBcmCcmX.png" />\n    <p> In finite-automaton\n    math, states are usually represented by the letter “q” followed by a number (usually italicized and subscripted, like\n    <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>, but not here, sorry). Note <code>q4</code>’s double circle which means it’s\n    a goal state, i.e. if we get here we’ve matched the regexp.\n    I should add that this was produced with\n    <a href="https://draw.io">draw.io</a>, which seems to make this sort of thing easy.\n    </p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">Back to that NFA</h2>\n    <p>So, here’s a challenge: Sketch out the traversal code in your head. Think about the input strings “AX” and “BCX” and just “X”\n    and how you’d get through the NFA to the Q4 goal state.</p>\n    <p>The trick is what’s called the ε-closure. When you get to a state, before you look at the next input symbol, you have to set\n    up to process it. In this case, you need to be able to transition on an A or B or C. So what you do is pull together the\n    start state <code>q0</code> and also any other states you can reach from there through ε-transitions. In this case, the ε-closure\n    for the start state is <code>{q0,\xa0q1,\xa0q2,\xa0q3}</code>.</p>\n    <p>Suppose, then, that you see a “B” input symbol. You apply it to all the states in the ε-closure. Only <code>q1</code> matches,\n    transitioning you to\n    <code>q2</code>. Before you look at the next input symbol, you compute the ε-closure for <code>q2</code>, which turns\n    out to be <code>{q2,\xa0q3}</code>. With this ε-closure, you can match “C” or “X”. If you get a “C”, you”ll step to\n    <code>q3</code>, whose ε-closure is just itself, because “X” is the only path forward.</p>\n    <p>So your NFA-traversal algorithm for one step becomes something like:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Start with a list of states.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Compute the ε-closure of that list.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Read an input symbol.</p></li>\n      <li><p>For each state in the ε-closure, see if you can traverse to another state.</p></li>\n      <li><p>If so, add it to your output list of states.</p></li>\n      <li><p>When you’re done, your output list of states is the input to this algorithm for the next step.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Computation issues</h2>\n    <p>Suppose your regular expression is <code>(A+BC?)+</code>. I’m not going to sketch out the NFA, but just looking at it tells\n    you that it has to have loopbacks; once you’ve matched the parenthetized chunk you need to go back to a state where you can\n    recognize another occurrence.\n    For this regexp’s NFA, computing the ε-closures can lead you into an infinite loop. (Should be obvious, but I didn’t realize it until\n    after the first time it happened.)</p>\n    <p>You can have loops and you can also have dupes. In practice, it’s not that uncommon for a state to have more than one\n    ε-transition, and for the targets of these transitions to overlap.</p>\n    <p>So you need to watch for loops and to dedupe your output. I think the only way to avoid this is with a cookie-crumbs\n    “where I’ve been” trail, either as a list or a hash table.</p> \n    <p>Both of these are problematic because they require allocating memory, and that’s something you really don’t want to do when\n    you’re trying to match patterns to events at Quamina’s historic rate of millions per second.</p>\n    <p>I’ll dig into this problem in a future Quamina-Diary outing, but obviously, caching computed\n    epsilon closures would avoid re-doing this computation.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, bear ε-closures in mind, because they’ll keep coming up as this series goes on.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">And finally, simplifying “NFA”</h2>\n    <p>At the top of this piece, I offered the standard definition of NFAs: First, when you’re in a\n    state and an input symbol arrives, you can transfer to more than one other state. Second, you can have ε-transitions.\n    Based on my recent work, I think this definition is redundant. Because if you need to transfer to two different states on some\n    input symbol, you can do that with ε-transitions.</p>\n    <p>Here’s a mini-NFA that transfers from state <code>q0</code> on “A” to both <code>q1</code> and <code>q2</code>.</p>\n    <img alt="An NFA transferring to two different states on an input symbol" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Splice-1.png" />\n    <p>And here’s how you can achieve the same effect with ε-transitions:</p>\n    <img alt="Transferring to two destinations using ε-transitions" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Splice-2.png" />\n    <p>In that NFA, in <code>qS</code> the “S” stands for “splice”, because it’s a state that exists to connect\n    two threads of finite-automaton traversal.</p>\n    <p>I’m pretty sure that this is more than just a mathematical equivalence. In my regexp implementation, so far at least,\n    I’ve never encountered a need to do that first kind of dual transition.

They’re doing this for exactly one\n    reason: They think they can discard armies of employees and replace them with LLM services, at the cost of\n    shipping shittier products.  Do you think your management would spend that kind of money to help you with a quicker first draft or\n    a summarized inbox?</p>\n    <p>Adobe said the quiet part out loud:\n    <a href="https://petapixel.com/2024/05/03/adobe-throws-photographers-under-the-bus-again-skip-the-photoshoot/">Skip the\n    Photoshoot</a>. </p>\n    <p>At this point someone will point out that previous technology waves have generated as much employment as they’ve eliminated.\n    Maybe so, but that’s not what business leaders think they’re buying. They think they’re buying smaller payrolls.</p>\n    <p>Maybe I’m overly sensitive, but thinking about these truths leads to a mental stench that makes me want to stay away from\n    it.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">How much does genAI cost?</h2>\n    <p>Well, I already mentioned all those hundreds of billions. But that’s pocket change. The investment community in general and\n    Venture Capital in particular will whine and moan, but the people who are losing the money are people who can afford to.</p>\n    <p>The first real cost is hypothetical: What if those business leaders are correct and they can gleefully dispose of millions of\n    employees? If you think we’re already suffering from egregious levels of inequality, what happens when a big chunk of the\n    middle class suddenly becomes professionally superfluous?  I’m no economist so I’ll stop there, but you don’t have to be a\n    rocket scientist to predict severe economic pain.</p>\n    <p>Then there’s the other thing that nobody talks about, the massive greenhouse-gas load that all those data centers are going\n    to be pumping out. This at a time when we we blow past one atmospheric-carbon metric after another and David Suzuki says\n    <a href="https://www.ipolitics.ca/2025/07/02/its-too-late-david-suzuki-says-the-fight-against-climate-change-is-lost/">the\n    fight against climate change is lost</a>, that we need to hunker down and work on survival at the local level.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">The real problem</h2>\n    <p>It’s the people who are pushing it.  Their business goals are quite likely, as a side-effect, to make\n    the world a worse place, and they don’t give a fuck.  Their technology will inevitably worsen the onrushing climate catastrophe,\n    and they don’t give a fuck.</p>\n    <p>It’s probably not as simple as “They’re just shitty people”<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009it’s not exactly easy to escape the\n    exigencies of modern capitalism.

The impact of\n    <em>anything</em> on coding\n    is hard to measure systematically, so we rely on anecdata and the community’s eventual consensus.\n    So, here’s my anecdata. Tl;dr: The AI was not useless.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-1">The problem</h2>\n    <p>My current work on\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/Technology/Quamina%20Diary/">Quamina</a> involves dealing with collections of finite-automata states,\n    which, in the Go programming language, are represented as slices of pointers to state instances:</p>\n    <blockquote><p><code>[]*faState</code></p></blockquote>\n    <p>The problem I was facing was deduping them, so that there would be only one instance corresponding to any particular\n    collection. This is what, in Java, the <code>intern()</code> call does with strings.</p>\n    <p>The algorithm isn’t rocket science:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Dedupe the states, i.e. turn the collection into a set.</p></li>\n      <li><p>For each set of states, generate a key.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Keep a hash table of sets around, and use the key to see whether you’ve already got such a set, and if so return\n      it. Otherwise, make a new entry in the hash table and return that.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>I’m out of touch with the undergrad CS curriculum, but this feels like a second-year assignment or thereabouts? Third?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Enter Claude</h2>\n    <p>So I prompted Claude thus:</p>\n    <blockquote><p>I need Go code to provide a "intern"-like function for lists of pointers. For example, if I have several\n    different []*int arrays, which may contain duplicates, I want to call intern() on each of them and get back a single canonical\n    pointer which is de-duplicated and thus a set.</p></blockquote>\n    <p>Claude did pretty well. It got the algorithm right, the code was idiomatic and usefully commented, and it also provided a\n    decent unit test (but in a <code>main()</code> stanza rather than a proper Go test file).\n    I didn’t try actually running it.</p>\n    <p>The interesting part was the key computation. I, being lazy, had just done a Go <code>fmt.Sprintf("%p")</code>\n    incantation to get a hex string representing each state’s address, sorted them, joined them, and that was the key.</p>\n    <p>Claude worked with the pointers more directly.</p>\n    <pre><code>\t// Sort by pointer address for consistent ordering\n\tsort.Slice(unique, func(i, j int) bool {\n\t\treturn uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(unique[i])) &lt; uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(unique[j]))\n\t})</code></pre>\n    <p>Then it concatenated the raw bytes of the map addresses and lied to Go by claiming it was a string.</p>\n    <pre><code>\t// Create key from pointer addresses\n\tkey := make([]byte, 0, len(slice)*8)\n\tfor _, ptr := range slice {\n\t\taddr := uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(ptr))\n\t\t// Convert address to bytes\n\t\tfor i := 0; i &lt; 8; i++ {\n\t\t\tkey = append(key, byte(addr&gt;&gt;(i*8)))\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn string(key)</code></pre>\n\t<p>This is an improvement in that the keys will be half the size of my string version.\n\tI didn’t copy-paste Claude’s code wholesale, just replaced ten or so lines of key construction.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">Take-away</h2>\n    <p>I dunno. I thought the quality of the code was fine, wouldn’t have decomposed the functions in the same way but wouldn’t have\n    objected on review. I was pleased with the algorithm, but then I would be since it was the same one I’d written, and, having\n    said that, quite possibly that’s the only algorithm that anyone has used. It will be <em>super</em> interesting if someone\n    responds to this write-up saying “You and Claude are fools, here’s a much better way.”</p>\n    <p>Was it worth fifteen minutes of my time to ask Claude and get a slightly better key computation?\n    Only if this ever turns out\n    to be a hot code path and I don’t think anybody’s smart enough to know that in advance.</p>\n    <p>Would I have saved time by asking Claude first? Tough to tell; Quamina’s data structures are a bit non-obvious and I would\n    have had to go to a lot of prompting work to get it to emit code I could use directly.\n    Also, since Quamina is low-level performance-critical infrastructure code, I’d be nervous about having any volume of code\n    that I didn’t really <em>really</em> understand.</p>\n    <p>I guess my take-away was that in this case, Claude knew the Go idioms and APIs better than I did; I’d never looked at the\n    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/unsafe">unsafe</a> package.</p>\n    <p>Which reinforces my\n    suspicion that genAI is going to be especially useful at helping generate code to talk to big complicated\n    APIs that are hard to remember all of.  Here’s an example: Any moderately competent Android developer could add a feature to an\n    app where it strobes the flash and surges the vibration in sync with how fast you’re shaking the device back and forth,\n    probably in an afternoon. But it would require a couple of dozen calls into the dense forest of Android APIs, and I suspect a\n    genAI might get you there a lot faster by just filling the calls in as prompted.</p>\n    <p>Reminder: This is just anecdata.</p>'}]}

How long has it been since an app you use has added a feature that\n    was genuinely excellent and let you do stuff you couldn’t before and didn’t get in your way and created no suspicion that it was\n    strip-mining your life for profit?  I’m here to tell you that this can still happen, and it’s a crushing criticism\n    of my profession that it so rarely does.</p>\n    <p>I’m talking about\n    <a href="https://www.qobuz.com/ca-en/connect">Qobuz Connect</a>. I believe there are other music apps that can do this sort of\n    stuff, but it feels like magic to me.</p>\n    <p>It’s like this. I listen to music at home on an audiophile system with big speakers, in\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/The%20World/Jaguar%20Diary/">our car</a>, and on\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/08/06/Jeanneau-795">our boat</a>.  The only app I touch is the\n    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qobuz.music">Qobuz Android app</a>. The only time it’s actually\n    receiving and playing the music itself is in the car, with the help of Android Auto.  In the other scenarios it’s talking to\n    Qobuz running on a Mac, which actually fetches the music and routes it to the audio system.\n    Usually it figures out what player I want it to control automatically, although there’ve been a couple\n    times when I drove away in the car and it got confused about where to send the music. Generally, it works great.</p>\n    <p>The app’s music experience is rich and involving.</p>\n    <img alt="Qobuz Android app screenshot" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/22/Screenshot_20250622-230116.png" />\n    <p>It has New Releases and curated playlists and a personalized stream for\n    me and a competent search function for those times I absolutely must listen to Deep Purple or Hania Rani or\n    whoever.</p>\n    <p>I get a chatty not-too-long email from Qobuz every Friday, plugging a few of the week’s new releases, with sideways and\n    backward looks too. (This week: A Brian Wilson stream.) The app has so much stuff, especially among the themed streams, that I\n    sometimes get lost. But somehow it’s not irritating; what’s on the screen remains musically interesting and you can always hit\n    the app’s Home button.</p>\n    <p>Qobuz has its own musical tastes that guide its curation. They’re not always compatible with\n    mine<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009my tolerance for EDM and mainstream Hip-hop remains low. And I wish they were\n    stronger on Americana. But the intersection is broad enough to provide plenty of enjoyable new-artist experiences. Let me share\n    one with you:\n    <a href="https://kwashibu.bandcamp.com/album/love-warrior-s-anthem">Kwashibu Area Band</a>, from Ghana.</p>\n    <p>Oh, one complaint: Qobuz was eating my Pixel’s battery. So I poked around online and it’s a known problem; you have to use the\n    Android preferences to stop it from running in the background. Huh? What was it doing in the background anyhow?! But it seems to\n    work fine even when it’s not doing it.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">A Mac, you say?</h2>\n    <p>The music you’re listening to is going to be stored on disk, or incoming from a streaming service. Maybe you want to serve\n    some of the stored music out to listen to it in the car or wherever. There are a variety of audio products in the\n    “Streamer” category that do some of these things in various combinations. A lot of them make fanciful claims about the\n    technology inside and are thus expensive, you can easily spend thousands.</p>\n    <p>But any reasonably modern computer can do all these things and more, plus it also can drive a big-screen display, plus it will\n    probably run the software behind whatever next year’s New Audio Hotness is.</p>\n    <p>At this point the harder-core geeks will adopt a superior tone of voice to say “I do all that stuff with FreeBSD and a bunch of\n    open-source packages running on a potato!”</p>\n    <p>More power to ’em. But I recommend a basic Apple Silicon based Mac Mini, M1 is fine, which you can get for like $300 used on\n    eBay. And if you own a lot of music and video you can plug in a 5T USB drive for a few more peanuts. This will run Plex and\n    Qobuz and almost any other imaginable streaming software. Plus you can plug it into your home-theater screen and it has a modern\n    Web browser so you can also play anything from anywhere on the Web.</p>\n    <p>I’ve been doing this for a while but I had one big gripe. When I wanted to stream music from the Mac, I needed to use a\n    keyboard and mouse, so I keep one of each, Bluetooth-flavored, nearby.

South Korea, of course, being the canonical example. But also Japan and Taiwan and Italy and Spain\n    and so on.</p>\n    <p>And, of course, the USA, where the numbers aren’t <em>that</em> much higher:\n    <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/fertility-rate">U.S. Fertility Rate\n    (1950-2025)</a>. Even so, the population still grows (because of immigration), albeit at less than 1% per annum:\n    <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/population-growth-rate">U.S. Population Growth\n    Rate</a>. If the MAGAs get their way and eventually stop all non-white immigration, the US will be in South Korea\n    territory within a generation or two. </p>    \n    <p>A reasonable person might ask why. It’s not really complicated, as you can read here:\n    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/15/opinion/birth-rate-parenting-natalism.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Pk8.OBam.dOi0UpP-8-DV&amp;smid=url-share">A Bold Idea to Raise the Birthrate: Make Parenting Less Torturous</a>.\n    From which I quote: “To date, no government policies have significantly improved their nation’s birthrates for a sustained\n    period.” The essay argues convincingly that it’s down to two problems: Capitalism and sexism. Neither of which offers an easy\n    fix. </p>\n    <p>Speaking of the travails of late capitalism, here’s how bad it’s getting:\n    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/opinion/crisis-working-homeless.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Qk8.jsTO.aUBSAMHw7Op2&amp;smid=url-share">America\n    Is Pushing Its Workers Into Homelessness</a>.</p>\n    <p>For a refreshingly different take on the business world, here’s Avery Pennarun, CEO of Tailscale: \n    <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20250530">The evasive evitability of enshittification</a>. Not sure I buy what he’s saying, but\n    still worth reading.</p>\n    <p>Most people who visit these pages are geeks or geek-adjacent. If you’re one of those, and especially if you enjoy the small\n    but vibrant genre of Comical Tech War Stories, I recommend\n    <a href="https://yeet.cx/blog/lock-free-rust/">Lock-Free Rust: How to Build a Rollercoaster\n    While It’s on Fire</a></p>\n    <p>And here’s write-up on an AWS product which has one of the best explanations I’ve ever read of the different flavors modern\n    databases come in: <a href="https://www.redshift-observatory.ch/white_papers/downloads/introduction_to_the_fundamentals_of_amazon_redshift.html">Introduction to the Fundamentals of Amazon Redshift</a></p>\n    <p>Of course, the geek conversation these days is much taken up with the the impact of genAI as in “vibe coding”. To\n    summarize the conversation: A few people, not obviously fools,  are saying “This stuff seems to help me” and many others, also\n    apparently sensible, are shouting back “You’re lying to yourself, it can’t be helping!”  Here is some of the testimony: \n    Kellan on <a href="https://laughingmeme.org//2025/05/25/vibe-coding-for-teams.html">Vibe\n    coding for teams, thoughts to date</a>, Armin Ronacher on\n    <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/12/agentic-coding/">Agentic Coding Recommendations</a>,\n    Harper on <a href="https://harper.blog/2025/05/08/basic-claude-code/">Basic Claude Code</a>, and \n    Klabnik on \n    <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/a-tale-of-two-claudes/">A tale of two Claudes</a></p>\n    <p>I lean to believing narratives of personal experience, but on the other hand the skeptics make good points. Another\n    random piece of evidence: Because I’m lazy, I tend to resist adopting technologies that have steep learning curves, which genAI\n    currently does. On many occasions, this has worked out well because those technologies have turned out not to pay off very\n    well. Am I a canary in the coal mine?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">*cough*</h2>\n    <p>Since I introduced myself into the narrative, I’ll note that today is my 70th birthday. I am told that this means\n    that my wisdom has now been maximized, so you’re safe in believing whatever you read in this space.  I don’t have anything\n    special to say to commemorate the occasion,\n    so here’s a picture of my neighborhood’s network infrastructure, which outlines the form of a\n    cathedral’s nave.

The ΛCDM-vs-MOND controversy, i.e. “Is there really dark\n    matter or does gravity get weird starting at the outer edges of galaxies?”, offers great entertainment value. And, there is\n    news!</p>\n    <p>First of all, here’s a nice overview on the controversy:\n    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21638v1">Modified Newtonian Dynamics: Observational Successes and Failures</a>.</p>\n    <p>Which points out that the behavior of “wide binary” star systems ought to help resolve the issue, but that people who\n    study it keep coming up with contradictory findings. Here’s the latest, from Korean researchers: Press release\n    <a href="http://www.sejongpr.ac.kr/sejongnewspaperview.do?currentPage=1&amp;searchField=&amp;searchValue=&amp;boardType=3&amp;pkid=73549&amp;utm_source=beehiiv&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=mediamobilize&amp;_bhlid=3e40dce99e536f4015a1dd2c6afd193a465d17ea">New method of measuring gravity with 3D velocities of wide binary stars is developed and confirms modified gravity</a>\n    and peer-reviewed paper:\n    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adce09">Low-acceleration Gravitational Anomaly\n    from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia Data Release 3</a>.\n    Spoiler: They think the gravity gets weird. I have a math degree but cosmology math is generally way over my head. Having said\n    that, I think those South Koreans may be a bit out over their skis; I generally distrust heroic statistical methods. We’ll\n    see.</p>\n    <p>Let’s do politics. It turns out that the barbaric junta which oppresses the people of China does not limit its barbarism\n    to its own geography: \n    <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/china-targets-dissidents-canada-1.7543745?cmp=rss">Followed, threatened and smeared\n    — attacks by China against its critics in Canada are on the rise</a>.</p>\n    <p>More politics: The MAGAs are always railing against “elites”.

They’re different, in interesting ways. Let’s walk through the\n    second one.</p> \n    <p>The little thumbnail at the top of the popup is what the image looked like when the C2PA was added. Not provided by the other\n    verifier.</p>\n    <p>The paragraph beginning “Displaying credentials…” says that the C2PA manifest was embedded in the JPG as opposed to stored\n    out on the \n    cloud; The cloud works fine, and is perhaps a good idea because the C2PA manifest can be quite large. I’m not clear on what the\n    “watermark” is about.</p>\n    <p>“Issued by Adobe” means that the Chrome extension verified the embedded C2PA against Adobe’s public key and can be\n    confident that yes, this was really signed by them.</p>\n    <p>“<b>Produced by</b> Timothy Bray” is interesting. How can it know? Well, it turns out that it used LinkedIn’s API to verify\n    that I am\n    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timbraysoftwareguy/">timbraysoftwareguy</a> over on LinkedIn. But it goes further; LinkedIn\n    has an integration with\n    <a href="https://www.clearme.com">Clear</a>, the airport-oriented identity provider. To get a Clear account you have to upload\n    government-issued ID, it’s not trivial.</p>\n    <p>So this short sentence expands to (take a deep breath) “The validator extension verified that Adobe said that\n    LinkedIn said that Clear said that the government ID of the person who posted this says that he’s named Timothy Bray.”</p>\n    <p>Note that the first extension’s popup also tells you that Adobe has verified what my LinkedIn and Instagram accounts\n    are. This seems super-useful and I wonder why the other omits it.</p>\n    <p>“<b>App or device used</b>…” is simple enough, but I’m not actually sure how it works; I guess Adobe has embedded a keypair\n    in my Lightroom installation? If I’d taken the picture with a C2PA-equipped camera this is where that history would be\n    displayed.</p>\n    <p>“<b>AI tool used</b> None”. Interesting and useful, since Adobe provides plenty of genAI-powered tools. Of course, this\n    relies on Lightroom telling the truth, but still.</p>\n    <p>The “View More” button doesn’t currently work; it takes you to the interactive\n    <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/verify/">contentcredentials.org/verify</a> page,\n    which seems to fail in retrieving the JPG. If you download the picture then upload it into the verify page (go ahead, it’s\n    free) \n    that seems to work fine. In addition to the info on the popup, the verify page will tell you (nontechically i.e. vaguely) what I\n    did to the picture with Lightroom.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">What’s good about this?</h2>\n    <p>Well, it’s here and it works! There’s all this hype about how cool it will be when the C2PA includes info about what model\n    of camera and lens it used and what the shutter speed was and so on, but eh, who cares really? What matters to me (and \n    should matter to the world) is <em>provenance</em>: Who posted this thing?</p>\n    <p>As I write this, supporters of Israel and Iran are\n    <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-ai-slop-fight-between-iran-and-israel/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter">having an AI Slop\n    Fight</a> with fake war photos and videos.\n    In a C2PA-rich world, you could check; If some clip doesn’t have Content Credentials you should\n    probably be suspicious, and if it does, it matters whether it was uploaded by someone at\n    <a href="https://www.idf.il/en/">IDF.il</a> versus\n    <a href="https://www.bbc.com">BBC.co.uk</a>.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">What’s wrong with this?</h2>\n    <p>Look, I hate to nitpick. I’m overwhelmingly positive on this news, it’s an existence proof that C2PA can be made to work in\n    the wild.\n    My impression is that most of the money and muscle comes from Adobe; good on ’em.\n    But there are things that would make it more useful, and usable by more Web sites. These are not listed in\n    any particular order.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">Identity!</h2>\n    <p>Adobe, it’s nice that you let me establish my identity with LinkedIn, Instagram, and Clear. But what I’d\n    <em>really</em> like is if you could also verify and sign my Fediverse and Bluesky handles. And, Fediverse and ATProto\n    developers, would you please, first of all, stop stripping C2PA manifests from uploaded photo EXIF, and secondly, add your own\n    link to the C2PA chain saying something like “Originally posted by @timbray@cosocial.ca.”</p>\n    <p>Because having verifiable media provenance in the world of social media would be a strong tool against disinformation\n    and slop.</p>\n    <p>Oh, and another note to Adobe: When I export a photo, the embed-manifest also offers me the opportunity, under the heading\n    “Web3”, to allow the image “be used for NFT creative attribution on supported marketplaces” where the supported marketplaces are\n    Phantom and MetaMask. Seriously, folks, in 2025? Please get this scammy cryptoslime out of my face.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Browsers please…</h2>\n    <p>This was done with Chrome extensions. There are people working on extensions for Firefox and\n    Safari, but they’re not here yet. Annoyingly, the extensions also don’t seem to work in mobile Chrome, which is where most\n    people look at most media.</p>\n    <p>I would love it if this were done directly and automatically by the browser.\n    The major browsers aren’t perfect, but their creators are known to take security seriously, and I’d be much happier trusting\n    one of them, rather than an extension from a company I’d never previously heard of.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">… or maybe JavaScript?</h2>\n    <p>The next-best solution would be a nice JS package that just Does The Right\n    Thing. It should work like the way I do fonts: If you look in the source for the page you are now reading, the splodge of JS at\n    the top includes a couple of lines \n    that mention “typekit.com”. Typekit (since acquired by Adobe) offers access to a huge selection of excellent fonts.\n    Those JS invocations result in the text you are now reading being displayed in\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/07/17/Tisa">FF Tisa Web Pro</a>.</p>\n    <p>Which<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009this is important<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009is not free. And to be clear, I am\n    willing to pay to get Content Credentials for the pictures on this blog. It feels exactly like paying a small fee for access to\n    a professionally-managed font library.\n    Operating a Content-Credentials service wouldn’t be free, it’d require running a\n    server and wrangling certs. At scale, though, it should be pretty cheap.</p>\n    <p>So here’s an offer: If someone launches a service that allows me to straightforwardly include the\n    fact that this picture was sourced from tbray.org in my Content Credentials, my wallet is (modestly) open.</p>\n    <p>By the way, the core JavaScript code is already under construction; here’s \n    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/c2pa-extension-validator">Microsoft</a> and the\n    <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/introduction">Content Authority Initiative</a> itself.\n    There’s also a Rust crate for server-side use, and a “c2patool” command-line utility based on it..</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Open-Source issues</h2>\n    <p>You’ll notice that the right-click-for-Content-Credentials doesn’t work on the smaller version of the picture embedded in the\n    text you are now reading; just the larger one.

But first…</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">The rent is too damn high</h2>\n    <p>I promise I’ll talk about genAI applications but let’s start with money. <em>Lots</em> of money, big numbers! For example,\n    venture-cap startup money pouring into AI, which as of now apparently adds up to\n    <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-nvidia-played-a-central-role-in-the-306-billion-ai-startup-boom-195741749.html">$306\n    billion</a>. And that’s just startups; Among the giants, Google alone\n    <a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/google-cloud-generative-ai-data-center-capacity-buildouts/739357/">apparently plans\n    $75B</a> in capital expenditure on AI\n    infrastructure, and they represent maybe a quarter at most of cloud capex. You think those are big numbers? McKinsey offers\n    <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-dollar-race-to-scale-data-centers">The cost of compute: A $7 trillion race to scale data centers</a>.</p>\n    <p>Obviously, lots of people are\n    wondering when and where the revenue will be to pay for it all. There’s one thing we know for sure:\n    The pro-genAI voices are fueled by hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fear and desire; fear that it’ll\n    never pay off and desire for a piece of the money. Can you begin to imagine the pressure for revenue that investors and\n    executives and middle managers are under?</p>\n    <p><a href="https://cosocial.ca/@timbray/114572118905328515">Here’s an example</a> of the kind of debate that ensues.</p>\n    <img alt="Anil Dash on Mastodon, on MCP vs the Fediverse" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/Anil-MCP.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>“MCP” is\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol">Model Context Protocol</a>, used for communicating between LLM\n    software and other systems and services.<br />I have no opinion as to its quality or utility.</p></div>\n    <p>I suggest that when you’re getting a pitch for genAI technology, you should have that greed and\n    fear in the back of your mind. Or maybe at the front.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">And that’s just the money</h2>\n    <p>For some reason, I don’t hear much any more about the environmental cost of genAI, the gigatons of carbon pouring out of the\n    system, imperilling my children’s future. Let’s please not ignore that; let’s read things like\n    <a href="https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-center-energy-needs-are-upending-power-grids-and-threatening-the-climate">Data\n    Center Energy Needs Could Upend Power Grids and Threaten the Climate</a> and let’s make sure every freaking conversation about\n    genAI acknowledges this grievous cost.</p>\n    <p>Now let’s look at a few sectors where genAI is said to be a big deal: Coding, teaching, and professional\n    communication. To keep things balanced, I’ll start in a space where I have kind things to say.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Coding</h2>\n    <p>Wow, is my tribe ever melting down. The pro- and anti-genAI factions are hurling polemical thunderbolts at each\n    other, and I mean extra hot and pointy ones. For example, here are 5600 words entitled\n    <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2025/06/i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now.html">I Think I’m Done Thinking About genAI\n    For Now</a>. Well-written words, too.</p>\n    <p>But, while I have a lot of sympathy for the contras and am sickened by some of the promoters, at the moment\n    I’m mostly in tune with Thomas Ptacek’s\n    <a href="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/">My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts</a>. It’s long and (fortunately) well-written\n    and I (mostly) find it hard to disagree with.</p>\n    <p>it’s as simple as this: I keep hearing talented programmers\n    whose integrity I trust tell me “Yeah, LLMs are helping me get shit done.” The probability that they’re all lying or being\n    fooled seems very low.</p>\n    <p>Just to be clear, I note an absence of concern for cost and carbon in these conversations. Which is unacceptable. But let’s\n    move on.</p>\n    <p>It’s worth noting that I learned two useful things from Ptacek’s essay that I hadn’t really understood. First, the “agentic”\n    architecture of programming tools: You ask the agent to create code and it asks the LLM, which will sometimes \n    hallucinate; the agent will observe that it doesn’t compile or makes all the unit tests fail, discards it, and re-prompts. If\n    it takes the agent module 25 prompts to generate code that while imperfect is at least correct, who cares?</p>\n    <p>Second lesson, and to be fair this is just anecdata: It feels like the Go programming language is especially well-suited to\n    LLM-driven automation. It’s small, has a large standard library, and a culture that has strong shared idioms for doing almost\n    anything. Anyhow, we’ll find out if this early impression stands up to longer and wider industry experience.</p>\n    <p>Turning our attention back to cost, let’s assume that eventually all or most developers become somewhat LLM-assisted. Are\n    there enough of them, and will they pay enough, to cover all that investment?  Especially given that models that are both\n    open-source and excellent are certain to proliferate? Seems dubious.</p>\n    <p>Suppose that, as Ptacek suggests, LLMs/agents allow us to automate the tedious low-intellectual-effort parts of our\n    job. Should we be concerned about how junior developers learn to get past that “easy stuff” and on the way to senior skills?\n    That seems a very good question, so…</p>\n    <h2 id="p-10">Learning</h2>\n    <p>Quite likely you’ve already seen Jason Koebler’s\n    <a href="https://www.404media.co/teachers-are-not-ok-ai-chatgpt/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter">Teachers Are Not OK</a>, a\n    frankly horrifying survey of genAI’s impact on secondary and tertiary education. It is a tale of unrelieved grief and pain\n    and wreckage. Since genAI isn’t going to go away and students aren’t going to stop being lazy, \n    it seems like we’re going to re-invent the way people teach and learn.</p>\n    <p>The stories of students furiously deploying genAI to avoid the effort of actually, you know,\n    learning, are sad. Even sadder  are those of genAI-crazed administrators leaning on faculty to become more efficient and\n    “businesslike” by using it.</p> \n    <p>I really don’t think there’s a coherent pro-genAI case to be made in the education context.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-11">Professional communication</h2>\n    <p>If you want to use LLMs to automate communication with your family or friends or lovers, there’s nothing I can say that will\n    help you. So let’s restrict this to conversation and reporting around work and private projects and voluntarism and so on.</p>\n    <p>I’m\n    pretty sure this is where the people who think they’re going to make big money with AI think it’s going to come from.\n    If you’re interested in that thinking,\n    <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Der8WWGeVxdOWx37bMV_nj9N1tUAVcvSSRa6qxKx75g/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1">here’s\n    a sample</a>; a slide deck by a Keith Riegert for the book-publishing business which, granted, is a bit stagnant and a whole lot\n    overconcentrated these days. I suspect scrolling through it will produce a strong emotional reaction for quite a few readers here.\n    It’s also useful in that it talks specifically about costs.</p>\n    <p>That is for corporate-branded output. What about personal or internal professional communication; by which I mean emails and\n    sales reports and committee drafts and project pitches and so on? I’m pretty negative about this. If your email or pitch\n    doc or whatever needs to be summarized, or if it has the colorless affectless error-prone polish of 2025’s LLMs, I would\n    probably discard it unread.\n    I already found the switch to turn off Gmail’s attempts to summarize my emails.</p>\n    <p>What’s the genAI world’s equivalent of “Tl;dr”? I’m thinking “TA;dr” (A for AI)\n    or “Tg;dr” (g for genAI) or just “LLM:dr”.</p>\n    <p>And this vision of everyone using genAI to amplify their output and everyone else using it to summarize and filter\n    their input feels simply perverse.</p>\n    <p>Here’s what I think is \n    <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@codinghorror/114606355212363074">an important finding</a>, ably summarized by Jeff Atwood:</p> \n    <img alt="Dare Obasanjo and Jeff Atwood on how to survive AI" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/Dare-Jeff.png" />\n    <p>Seriously, since LLMs by design emit streams that are optimized for plausibility and for harmony with the model’s\n    training base, in an AI-centric world there’s a powerful incentive to say things that are implausible, that are out of tune,\n    that are, bluntly, weird. So there’s one upside.</p>\n    <p>And let’s go back to cost. Are the prices in Riegert’s slide deck going to pay for trillions in capex?\n    Another example: My family has a Google workplace account, and the price just went up from $6/user/month to\n    $7. The announcement from Google emphasized that this was related to the added value provided by Gemini. Is $1/user/month gonna\n    make this tech make business sense?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-13">What I can and can’t buy</h2>\n    <p>I can sorta buy the premise that there are genAI productivity boosts to be had in the code space and maybe some other\n    specialized domains.  I can’t buy for a second that genAI is anything but toxic for anything education-related.  On the\n    business-communications side, it’s damn well gonna be tried because billions of dollars and many management careers depend on\n    it paying off. We’ll see but I’m skeptical.</p>\n    <p>On the money side? I don’t see how the math and the capex work. And all the time, I think about the carbon that’s poisoning\n    the planet my children have to live on.</p>\n    <p>I think that the best we can hope for is the eventual financial meltdown leaving a few useful islands of things that\n    are actually useful at prices that make sense.</p>\n    <p>And in a decade or so, I can see business-section stories about all the big data center shells that were never filled in,\n    standing there empty, looking for another use. It’s gonna be tough, what can you do with buildings that have no windows?</p>'}]}

The game appears (and plays) like an aquatic combination of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/18/coffee-talk-review/">Coffee Talk</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/15/steamworld-dig-2-review/">SteamWorld Dig</a></em>, which are both games I very much enjoy. I downloaded <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> upon release on Switch, but it fell into my backlog until this year; in recent months, I&#8217;ve gotten around to properly playing through the game, and I&#8217;m glad I did so &#8211; not only does it deliver on the rewarding gameplay loop and sumptuous pixel art graphics I hoped for, but it&#8217;s been an ideal showcase for chilled handheld gaming on the Nintendo Switch 2!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting the review, I&#8217;d like to mention the brief controversy around <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, as I remember it adding unfair caution to my approach to the game. Back in 2023, the game was nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards, which drew criticism because the game wasn&#8217;t an Indie game &#8211; the developer MINTROCKET was a subsidiary of Nexon, a lucrative South Korean company. The developers were not responsible for the game being nominated, and it appears that the nomination was based off of the pixel art graphics and relaxed alternative vibe of the game, instead of the literal definition of an independent company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, the CEO of MINTROCKET &#8211; and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> creator &#8211; Jaeho Hwang said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>“I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like a more detailed explanation and opinion, I highly recommend <a href="https://indiecator.org/2023/11/15/why-is-dave-the-diver-not-indie/">this post on <em>Indiecator</em> by MagiWasTaken</a>, which discusses the situation in better detail than I could in this short review introduction. Ironically, it&#8217;s since been announced in 2024 that MINTROCKET is becoming independent (albeit with support from Nexon to carry out the move). My main point is that this controversy is not something to think ill of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> or MINTROCKET for, and that allowed me to dive into the game fresh. Right, that&#8217;s enough preamble, so let&#8217;s get into the review!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Catch of the Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> follows the story of Dave and his friends, who&#8217;ve travelled to the oceanic Blue Hole to set up a sushi restaurant called Bancho Sushi (named after the head chef Bancho). As the title suggests, Dave must dive underwater to collect the fish and ingredients, and this forms the majority of the game &#8211; you must balance risk and reward as you collect as much as Dave can carry, whilst keeping track of your oxygen levels and means to get back to the surface &#8211; either by swimming back up, or finding an Escape Pod point. If you run out of oxygen and get stranded underwater, you lose all but one of your collected items, which severely impacts the success of the sushi restaurant in the evenings. This risk/reward system is reminiscent of the digging in <em>SteamWorld Dig</em>, and is implemented superbly here &#8211; the player has to make the tough decision between keeping what they&#8217;ve got, or risking pushing a little further and potentially losing it all. It&#8217;s a brilliant gameplay loop that keeps you coming back for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15160" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15140" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15139" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The game eases you in gently, starting with introducing the mechanics of catching fish at a relatively shallow depth. Your main weapon is the harpoon, which can be fired in front of you to reel in fish. However, there&#8217;s a delay whilst the fish struggles, which gives other dangerous creatures the time to close in on Dave &#8211; and later on, the harpoon requires multiple hits and/or extra button combinations to capture stronger fish. There are also various items to discover and collect, either as supplementary ingredients found in submerged cooking pots, or as materials scattered on the sea floor. Dave only has a certain amount they can hold at once, which quickly becomes reason to earn the Gold needed for upgrading your Cargo Box storage limit &#8211; as well as your Air Tank, Harpoon Gun, and more. In turn, this motivates the player for the sushi segments of the game; depending on how well the restaurant performs in the evenings, the more Gold you&#8217;ll earn for upgrades. Both sides of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> continue to ingeniously compliment each other in this way, as success in one helps you in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the sushi segments are rather different from the diving, and this is where my earlier comparison to <em>Coffee Talk</em> comes in. After setting sail to Bancho Sushi, you start by going through a list of your possible dishes to serve in your evening menu; your selection is based upon the fish you&#8217;ve caught and the ingredients you&#8217;ve acquired. The quality and quantity of your haul determines your success, as rarer fish open up more expensive dishes that result in a more lucrative evening. Upon selecting each dish, you can also enhance it if you have enough excess ingredients &#8211; a process given extra visual flair by the wonderful animated cutscenes of Bancho preparing the food. These animations aren&#8217;t limited to just Bancho, and are sprinkled throughout <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, such as when weapons expert Duff upgrades your guns. Each of these sequences has a tongue-in-cheek over-exaggerated tone, and add to the playful charm of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15133" height="360" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif?w=640" width="640" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in Bancho Sushi you can browse and sell your ingredients for quickfire Gold, as well as decorate the restaurant as you see fit, and even hire extra members of staff to help you out. The latter are essential, as over time the restaurant gets busier; once you open the restaurant, you control Dave as he serves dishes and maintains the restaurant, and hiring extra hands to help is key to success. Whether it&#8217;s pouring drinks, dashing around to serve sushi plates, cleaning up, or keeping Bancho well-stocked with sushi, this is a frenetic <em>Overcooked</em>-style part of the game that contrasts well with the diving. It&#8217;s certainly not as layered as the underwater gameplay, but it&#8217;s not supposed to be, and does a successful job at giving the player a break between each dive. Plus, it&#8217;s extremely satisfying to see the profits come in &#8211; which can then be spent on upgrades the next day, when the cycle begins anew&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Just Keep Swimming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this core gameplay loop, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> steadily introduces new characters and locations throughout the seven main story chapters. They&#8217;re an eclectic bunch, each with their own expertise and side quests. Archaeologist Dr. Bacon propels the main story forward; as you dive deeper, you discover much more than just fish, including secret civilizations and bigger ecological threats to the Blue Hole &#8211; the latter of which is tracked by the biologist Ellie, who gives you various collection tasks through the Ecowatcher app. Speaking of which, your progress is mostly tracked via these apps, which are accessed via the efficient menu on Dave&#8217;s smartphone. To give a few examples: you might use the phone to acquire and upgrade weapons (with the help of the aforementioned Duff); you might browse your snaps for photographer Udo; or you might look through your Pokémon-style Marinca collection for Sato, an Ash Ketchum lookalike!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15146" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15153" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15154" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between all these characters and side quests, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> has something for everyone. If you like collecting then you can focus on filling out the Marinca (essentially a Pokédex for fish), if you like the sushi-management side you can focus on optimising your earnings, and if you like exploring then you can focus on the diving. Whichever way you play, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> smartly manages to naturally push the story on regardless &#8211; for example, a character named Otto opens a farm partway into the game, where you can grow crops such as rice. Growing these ingredients helps you to reliably create more valuable dishes in the evening; but to help out Otto and subsequently build up the farm, you need to collect certain items, which requires becoming proficient at the diving. Each element of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> gently motivates the others in this way, and therefore pushes the player to test out every facet of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a side effect of this admirable gameplay variety is that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> occasionally inserts under-baked minigames or quick time events. One instance of this is the cooking competition side missions, where you must gather ingredients for Bancho as you normally would, but upon doing so, you must then engage in first-person cooking challenges. These consist of basic button presses and directional inputs, and feel like a rushed version of either a <em>Cooking Mama</em> or <em>Mario Party</em> minigame. It was the rare moment in <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> where I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15123" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15124" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15127" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15136" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, some of these asides work better than others &#8211; a relatively quick soldering minigame is an enjoyable and brief inclusion, and there&#8217;s a compelling <em>Balatro</em>-style card game, but on the other hand, a one-time stealth sequence is particularly badly designed. These hiccups are rare enough that they don&#8217;t significantly detract from <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, but they were also noticeable enough that I had to mention them in this review. They just feel unnecessary &#8211; it&#8217;s as if <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> felt it had to extend itself beyond the main gameplay loop that it executes so superbly. If anything, the high quality of the core diving-and-sushi-selling gameplay only make the brief diversions more jarring.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Deadly Depths</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the various other side missions and gameplay mechanics, it&#8217;s the diving that&#8217;s understandably the focus of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, and it&#8217;s exceptionally well-balanced. As aforementioned, your initial harpoon is a unique weapon to master &#8211; but Dave can also carry one firearm, either by collecting them underwater or by crafting them beforehand. There&#8217;s a range of weapon types: you might use the Net Gun for catching large swathes of fish, or perhaps the Grenade Launcher for explosive damage, or even (my weapon of choice) the Sniper Rifle for long-range damage. The latter is especially handy when tackling sea life that is aggressive at close range, such as the many sharks patrolling the Blue Hole!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15161" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Dave isn&#8217;t just reeling in small fish. You&#8217;ll soon be fighting not only sharks, but hostile jellyfish, giant squids, and plenty more! Significant story events are often accompanied by a boss fight against a dangerous opponent such as these, introduced with stylish freeze frames reminiscent of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and signifying the stakes of the encounter. Additionally, new areas of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> can be a trial by fire, with enemies that suddenly reduce huge amounts of your oxygen supply (which doubles as a health bar of sorts) with a single hit. However, the challenge rarely felt unfair, and any failed dives were always down to my own mistakes &#8211; and only left me more motivated to improve my aquatic skills or upgrade my gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, as well as your harpoon and firearm, Dave can carry a melee weapon (also used for mining materials) and two pieces of equipment. The latter of these can vary, from battle items such as a proximity mine, to ways of helping Dave in a pinch, such as portable oxygen refills. Most of these can be found underwater, or alternatively, they can be pre-purchased from Cobra in the boat before starting your dive, adding another way for the player to customise their approach. Overall, there&#8217;s a well-judged balance between giving the player plenty of options, but not giving you so much power that you can become complacent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15142" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15172" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15168" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when you feel comfortable with Dave and his toolset, the missions being asked of you often cleverly push you out of your comfort zone &#8211; and if you&#8217;re not careful, it doesn&#8217;t take much for a dangerous enemy or perilous area to derail your dive and leave you back at the boat almost empty-handed. It&#8217;s oh-so-easy to fall into the trap of completing just one more mission, collecting just one more item, capturing just one more fish &#8211; but equally, there&#8217;s an undeniable thrill to escaping just in time. In the later chapters, missions become more specific to match your increased skills, and particular ingredients can necessitate repeated captures of rare creatures. This cycle reminded me of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and similarly to that series, provides a tangible reason to keep capturing the most elusive fish &#8211; in this case, to find the rarest ingredients and compose the finest dishes at Bancho Sushi!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Under the Sea</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the endearing yet adventurous nature of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the graphical style; the gorgeous pixel-art invites you in, making diving a little deeper &#8211; and playing a little longer &#8211; even more enticing. The shallow regions are full of bright welcoming colours, but the variety only builds from here. Every layer under the water has a unique visual identity, such as the dark Blue Hole Depths, or the extreme cold and heat of later areas. Meanwhile, night-time dives feature a shining kaleidoscope of colourful foliage that feels magical to navigate &#8211; when you&#8217;re not being pursued by deadly fish, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15162" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the human character designs have a palpable sense of personality. This gets more spotlight in the earlier-mentioned animated cutscenes, which blend the stunning pixel art with the tongue-in-cheek humour that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> does so well. By the end of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, the roster of characters have a real sense of camaraderie between them, which contributes to that overall warm and relaxed feeling that the game has. Add in the detailed multitude of marine species and food recipes, and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> really is a delectably beautiful game. Playing it on the large handheld screen <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/09/09/did-my-hopes-for-the-switch-2-become-a-reality/">of the Switch 2</a> has only accentuated this feeling further for me &#8211; and it&#8217;s been a great example for how that console helps the back catalogue of the original Switch to shine even brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial compliment to the visuals of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the music, which is often a wonderfully soothing backdrop to your deep sea exploration. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a notably therapeutic game when you’re just casually collecting fish, exploring the vast swathes of water, and listening to the delicate musical backdrop. My favourite piece of music is for a late-game frozen area, where these tranquil tones morph into a synth-style inspirational beat. Also, music fans will get an extra treat from a certain cameo appearance at Bancho Sushi, who comes complete with a musical performance that I’ve been listening to many times since! Not to be glossed over is the sound design, too &#8211; the sounds of marine life, the tense pull of a harpoon, the whooshing of waves, it all sounds authentic and distinct, and pulls you further into the watery world of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15163" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15148" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg?w=863" width="863" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15150" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing about this game &#8211; it reels you in, not necessarily in a sudden way, but a gradual one. As the in-game days go by, you settle more thoroughly into the gameplay loop, getting more familiar with characters old and new, until they become familiar friends on your adventure. There&#8217;s a sense of pleasing routine to checking your farms for crops and ingredients, then going diving and completing missions, before then preparing for the evening Bancho Sushi business. It&#8217;s a lot like the charm of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> or <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but with the added element of gripping underwater gameplay to go alongside it. The game is kept fresh by the steady incline of options and equipment available to Dave, and this creates an endgame with potentially endless longevity. Even when you finish all of the main story missions, you still have a restaurant business to run, and you can continue building it out to your hearts content. There&#8217;s extra DLC too, two of which (the <em>Dredge</em> and <em>Godzilla</em> tie-in packs) are free, for those looking for extra content!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a delight to play through <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. The mix of gripping gameplay and relaxing sushi simulation &#8211; combined with the incredible art direction and music &#8211; makes for an RPG full of endearing charm and well-meaning adventure. At its heart is whimsy and a sense of positivity, and that soaks through into every part of the game &#8211; and each part compliments the other in a wonderfully natural way. My only criticism is that this enthusiasm leads to the introduction of impromptu minigames and quick time events that sometimes feel underdeveloped in contrast to the main diving gameplay &#8211; but they&#8217;re few and far between, and a drop in the ocean compared to the sea of brilliance within <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. There&#8217;s brilliant longevity built in too &#8211; even after finishing the main story, the diving and sushi restaurant aspects remain, for those who&#8217;d like to continue building Bancho Sushi into the best restaurant it can be. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a treasure of a game, and it comes highly recommended from me!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center

This particular Direct was split into three distinct segments: first about the 40th Anniversary of Mario, then news for the original Nintendo Switch, and then finally information on the Switch 2 &#8211; and altogether it made for a barnstorming hour-long performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo has been on a run of brilliant Directs over the last few years, but this might genuinely be my favourite one for a long while. Many of the announcements in this Direct speak specifically to me and the games I have been looking forward to, and it&#8217;s genuinely made whittling my choices down to five a tough task! If you&#8217;d like to see the full Nintendo Direct, you can do so below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Honourable Mentions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of it being a tough task&#8230; With so much packed into the Direct, I am first going to run through some other announcements that I was glad or intrigued to see, but didn&#8217;t make the cut for the five announcements that appealed most to me personally. The Nintendo Direct started with several <em>Mario </em>announcements in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary: this included a trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> in 2026, as well as a collection of both <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> games for Nintendo Switch, coming October 2nd this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retrospectively, this does make <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/04/lets-chat-3d-mario-games-are-coming-to-switch-but-where-is-galaxy-2/">the decision not to include <em>Galaxy 2</em> in the <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> collection</a> feel very calculated. I personally will likely pass on this new release of the <em>Galaxy </em>games, as the £58.99 cost (or £33.99 separately) feels excessive &#8211; and whilst they are superb games, I doubt I&#8217;ll play them enough when there are so many other new games to play. I do, however, hope to get the physical <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOor7cl-qF_B_yaH1ketH1_ep2UqAIeMsULytGxbXaJ-8c79YpmKe">Rosalina&#8217;s Storybook</a> they are making, as that would be lovely to keep in the collection!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15028" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15029" height="377" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg?w=670" width="670" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15027" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15026" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we got a release date of 4th December for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was great to have confirmed &#8211; and the only reason it isn&#8217;t in my main five picks below is that the new footage left me a bit hesitant. We got to see the new bike Samus will use to traverse the world, and there was something off about it &#8211; the world looked a bit too empty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The footage reminded me of the infamous Mako in the first <em>Mass Effect</em> game, which was also known for wide open spaces that felt empty and were awkward to navigate. Visually, the bike is very cool, and the first-person segments look fantastic, but I was surprised at the briefness of this new footage. I sincerely hope that isn&#8217;t a sign of a lack of confidence in the game; either way, eight years after the initial announcement, I remain very excited for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> to finally launch!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I&#8217;d like to give a mention to the <em>Pokémon</em> segment of the Direct. We got the announcement of a brand new spin-off game named <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, which looks like a mix between<em> Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>, where you play as a Ditto-turned-human (whether this is charming or horrific, you decide)! This game probably won&#8217;t be for me, but I envisage it being very popular, by blending life-sim mechanics with the popularity of the world of <em>Pokémon</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, we got more info for the soon-to-be-released <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, showing off new Mega Evolutions; this segment ended with an announcement of the upcoming <em>Mega Dimension</em> paid DLC, and this felt quite cynical &#8211; it feels strange to have paid DLC announced before we even have the base game. I&#8217;ll wait and see how that DLC materialises, but for now, I&#8217;m fine not seeing much more about <em>Z-A</em>, as I&#8217;m definitely purchasing the game at launch. From here, the Direct transitioned into the surprise announcement of <em>Danganronpa 2&#215;2</em>, a new version of <em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> with added content! I only relatively recently finished (<a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/09/danganronpa-2-goodbye-despair-review-an-ambitious-beautiful-mess-of-a-sequel/">and reviewed</a>) the original game on Switch, and I really enjoyed it overall, so I&#8217;ll be curious to see how much difference the additions make.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15020" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15024" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15025" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15022" height="338" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg?w=600" width="600" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That was quite a long honourable mentions section, wasn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a result of just how many exciting announcements we received; I finished this Direct feeling very optimistic about the future of the Switch 2, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten into my top five reason why! When there are so many announcements, writing this sort of article helps me process the Direct and focus in on the games I&#8217;m going to prioritise playing, and I hope it is an enjoyable read for you too! Right, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#5: Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the most exciting part of the <em>Mario </em>section of the Direct was the announcement of a brand new Yoshi game, named <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em>! Yoshi side-scrollers have a reputation for charming art directions &#8211; for example <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Woolly World</em> and <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Crafted World</em> &#8211; and this game continues that, with a gorgeous stop-motion visual style bursting with colour and personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot of the game follows Yoshi after the appearance of a peculiar book named Mr. E, with pages detailing mysterious creatures. Yoshi jumps into the book (which is the reason for the storybook graphical style) and meets various new creatures, with the details jotted down into the book as Yoshi does so. Completing the storybook of fantastical creatures is an accompaniment to the charming platforming, and there&#8217;s a palpable sense of warmth and whimsy to it all. This game looks ideal for playing on a rainy weekend, wrapped up warm and enjoying the cosy gameplay. I see <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>being a brilliant experience for all ages of players, and I look forward to playing it myself when it releases in Spring 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#4: Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Direct contained the announcements of release dates for several high-profile previously-announced games, and three of these appear on my list. Starting this off is <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>, the third <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> game after the original and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/05/15/my-to-play-list-may-2023-progress/">Age of Calamity</a></em>, which is confirmed to release on November 6th. Just as the latter of those filled in story gaps for <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, one of the main appeals of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is adding story details for <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. Specifically, the time period that Princess Zelda is sent back to in that game &#8211; and I&#8217;m glad to see this time covered more thoroughly, as it felt to me that Zelda was unfairly side-lined in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as a release date, the new footage showed off playable characters such as Queen Sonia, King Rauru, and a new unnamed Korok character. The gameplay looks like the expected <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-esque combat, but there are some additions, such as Zonai devices and multi-character Sync Strikes that change depending on the character combinations. There&#8217;s also the confirmation of local GameShare multiplayer and splitscreen, and glimpses of many epic visual sequences such as airborne Gleeok battles. I accept that the gameplay will likely be repetitive, but for me the appeal of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games is the visual spectacle and extra lore &#8211; and<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> looks to be delivering on that!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#3: Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the brand new announcements of the Direct was that of a new mainline <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, named <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em>. It&#8217;s been wonderful to see <em>Fire Emblem</em> gradually become a household name in the West, with the 3DS games such as <em>Awakening</em> laying the groundwork for <em>Three Houses</em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/14/a-little-zelda-a-lotta-farming-takeaways-from-the-nintendo-direct/">Engage</a> </em>to be massive hits on Switch. The distinction setting <em>Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart is the gladiator-style Heroic Games, which has a multitude of characters competing for the fulfilled wishes that supposedly reward your victory. At the end of the trailer, we see a tease of Sothis, a character from Three Houses &#8211; so it appears there may be a story connection to that game as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the game looks stunning, with gorgeous anime visuals, and clean turn-based strategy UI design. Part of the appeal of <em>Fire Emblem</em> is the stakes of building character relationships in a world where permadeath is possible, and the gladiatorial setting will hopefully provide a fresh twist to that structure that will set<em> Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart. The trailer has a variety of striking characters, and I&#8217;m looking forward to finding my favourites! For now, we only have a general 2026 release date, so I&#8217;d guess that this game will be one of the major late-year releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#2: Resident Evil: Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think it surprising that I&#8217;ve put two already-announced games above the news of a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game; but that&#8217;s a reflection of my adoration for the franchises these next two games are a part of, and how stoked I am to see additional news about their next instalments. Firstly we have <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, the much-anticipated ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> game (if you don&#8217;t count <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/27/resident-evil-zero-review/"><em>Resident Evil Zero</em></a>). This latest entry stars FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she pursues the truth about a deadly virus and the mystery of her mother&#8217;s death &#8211; a path which leads her to the ruins of Raccoon City. This game had already been announced for other consoles, but this is the formal announcement of a Switch 2 version, which is brilliant to see. On Switch, <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/11/25/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/16/resident-evil-village-review/">Resident Evil Village</a></em> could only be played as Cloud games, but the more conventional release of <em>Requiem </em>shows that the console can (for now, at least) keep up with modern large-scale third-party releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually might play <em>Requiem </em>on Switch 2 &#8211; my only other means would be PC or Xbox Series S, and as someone who likes to collect physical copies of <em>Resident Evil</em> games on console, that makes the Switch 2 version more appealing to me. <em>Requiem </em>is up there as one of my most anticipated games; I adore the <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise, and am eagerly awaiting <em>Requiem</em> to see how they interweave the lore of the series into the story. Other than Chris Redfield, we haven&#8217;t had any of the earlier characters show up in the main series since <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, and with the return to Raccoon City, this feels like an ideal time for some guest appearances of older, more experienced versions of those fan favourites. Grace Ashcroft is also the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character from the lesser-known spin-off <em>Resident Evil Outbreak</em> games, which already shows that Capcom is happy playing with some deep-cut lore. I happen to have bought the two <em>Outbreak</em> games second-hand before <em>Requiem</em> was even announced, and am planning to play them before the launch of <em>Requiem </em>and write up my thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Requiem </em>trailer in the Direct was full of intense visuals, threatening figures, and story hints (such as the iconic Umbrella Corporation logo). It struck me that there&#8217;s an underlying grungy tone waiting to break out, which I&#8217;m very excited to discover. This can even be seen in the logo for <em>Requiem</em>, and the burned-out profile shot of Grace near the end of this new trailer. Right now, the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise is in a very healthy place (as healthy a a series about viral monstrosities can be, anyway), and it&#8217;s given Capcom a resulting confidence that could make this game utterly exceptional. They&#8217;re playing their cards close to their chest, concealing the full extent of the horrors that await us on February 27th&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#1: Hades II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yes, oh yes. This is an announcement fans of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/14/hades-review/">Hades</a></em> and Supergiant Games have been awaiting since the reveal of <em>Hades II</em> back at The Game Awards in 2022, and now it&#8217;s here &#8211; the release date of the official 1.0 version, releasing digitally on Switch and PC on September 25th (and physically on November 20th). The first <em>Hades</em> is a phenomenal roguelike action game that turned many players into fans of the genre, but it was quite a surprise when Supergiant announced a sequel &#8211; not only was the first game utterly jam-packed with content and ideas, but they&#8217;d never done a sequel game before. I&#8217;ve purposefully been avoiding details about the game in Early Access, as I&#8217;d like to go in fresh and see what marvels Supergiant have cooked up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon this could be a <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>/<em>Galaxy 2</em> situation, where the developers have so many ideas and so much creativity to share, that they need a whole other game to fit it all in. This time, we play as the immortal Princess of the Underworld, battling against the Titan of Time and exploring an even larger and deeper mythic world of Olympian Gods. In the Direct, this was visualized with a cutscene that gave me goosebumps from the visual flair on show; Supergiant are known for their sumptuous visuals and music, and that&#8217;s very much still the case here. I&#8217;m eager to dive back into the rich gameplay and gripping story of the world of <em>Hades</em>, reuniting with previous characters (Artemis is back!) and meeting new ones. I honestly didn&#8217;t expect the release date to be so soon, but in less than two weeks we&#8217;ll be able to play the 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> &#8211; discovering new Boons, enemies, locations, and more. Bring it on!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>This Nintendo Direct was sensational, and answered many questions about release dates and upcoming games for the Switch 2 (and Switch) release slate. I&#8217;ve been enjoying my gaming a lot recently, and this Direct has only fuelled that passion more &#8211; the only problem is going to be finding the time to play all these games! Speaking of which, I&#8217;m off to play some of those said games! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks so much for reading, I really appreciate it.

It&#8217;s been roughly a year and a half since I wrote that post, and the Switch 2 has been out for just over three months &#8211; so we now have comprehensive knowledge of what the system offers. With the Switch 2, Nintendo took the wise (and safe) approach, capitalising on the continued popularity of the Switch brand and not changing things too drastically. The console is more of an iteration rather than a revolution, but it certainly makes significant changes and upgrades in certain areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had some time with the Switch 2, I thought it&#8217;d be a suitable moment to take a look back at my aforementioned post about my hopes for the console, run one-by-one through the list, and talk about which became a reality (and which didn&#8217;t). Then, at the end of the post, I&#8217;ll summarise my current personal opinions on the Switch 2, taking these results into account. Right then, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Optimize the eShop: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My foremost request was to improve the eShop, which was struggling on multiple fronts on the original Switch: the sheer volume of releases made discoverability of games difficult; there was a lack of quality control; and the user interface was susceptible to noticeable lag. In my opinion, this was one of the most important areas for Nintendo to improve upon &#8211; it might seem less flashy than other aspects, but improving the process of finding new digital games is an underrated key aspect of a modern console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To start on a positive note, I&#8217;m pleased with the way Nintendo has improved the responsiveness of the eShop. I immediately noticed how much quicker and easier it is to navigate the store &#8211; gone are the painful moments waiting for the eShop to catch up with your inputs. Whether this is down to the increased hardware power, general eShop optimisation, or both, it improves the experience of browsing through the available games, and encourages curiosity as a result. In my book, that boost to game discoverability is a win for both the player and the developers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, whilst Nintendo has bolstered the options on the eShop main menu, it&#8217;s not as extensively as I&#8217;d hoped. Most of the options &#8211; such as the Search, Current Offers, and Coming Soon &#8211; are the same, and the only brand new addition is the For You tab, which recommends games based on your own gameplay trends. I was really hoping for some other additions, or even a review system so that players could help to recommend games for others. As it is, the eShop still has the problem of a constant inundation of new games &#8211; and whilst the Popular New Releases sub-section is a step in the right direction, any game that doesn&#8217;t qualify for this (or the Highlights tab) will get very limited time to grab player attention before the spotlight is taken by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14942" height="645" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14940" height="639" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14938" height="624" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14941" height="598" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of quality control, I reserve full judgement until more time has passed, but it seems that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t changed their approach. Lots of cheap-looking games are still flooding the eShop, and there are still Hentai games appearing relatively frequently. From my perspective, Nintendo could still do with raising the bar of entry, in order to curate a higher level of overall quality across the eShop. The current influx of these low-quality games worsens the issue of discoverability for other titles, which get mired amidst them despite taking much more time and effort to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the steps I&#8217;d still like to see taken for more eShop filtering options and better quality control, Nintendo has still significantly improved the eShop, especially in terms of responsiveness. Therefore, I mark this section as a success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More Power: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is that age-old request for new consoles &#8211; that they have more power, and are able to present games in higher framerates and resolutions. Since the Wii/DS era, Nintendo has rarely (if ever) been known as the technical powerhouse, with art direction, creative hardware, and recognizable IP being more important for bringing in players. That said, the Switch 2 is a big step up from the original Switch, with Nvidia claiming that it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nvidia-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">&#8220;10 times the graphical performance&#8221;</a> of the previous console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a technical expert, so I look for comparisons to other consoles to get a handle on where the Switch 2 lands power-wise. The general perception seems to be that at peak performance, docked on a TV, the Switch 2 is comparable to a PlayStation 4 Pro, but still behind the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles &#8211; which essentially matches my prediction back in March 2024. When played in handheld mode, the system is closer to a base PlayStation 4, but that is compensated for by the smaller screen, which often makes games look crisper to the eye (at least for me).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a hybrid system with a handheld option, battery life is another crucial factor to consider, and the increased performance does appear to have hurt the Switch 2 in this area. You generally get around two-three hours when playing any sort of intensive game, which can feel quite short. However, most of the time I don&#8217;t see this being an issue, unless I am on a very long journey &#8211; and it&#8217;s rare not to have a nearby place to plug in and charge. Whilst that isn&#8217;t an excuse, I prefer Nintendo providing stronger hardware and a shorter battery life rather than the opposite, so I&#8217;m still satisfied on this front. For example, I&#8217;m playing <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/09/17/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-14-09-23/">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em> at the moment, and occasionally having to charge the console is a small price to pay for how well it plays and looks in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14949" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14946" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14947" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14948" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When playing in handheld mode, the screen really is stunning; the increased size and power makes games look incredible, and it makes playing in bed (or wherever you prefer) feel like a luxury. The vibrancy and sharpness of the screen &#8211; especially when held close up for handheld gaming &#8211; gave me that new-generation-upgrade feeling that I was looking for. I&#8217;ve heard some disappointment that Nintendo didn&#8217;t use an OLED screen, but in my opinion the LCD screen is more than sufficient, and if it helps keep costs down then that&#8217;s a reasonable trade. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll get an OLED version of the Switch 2 (like for the original Switch) at some point too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only Switch 2-exclusive game I&#8217;ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em> (you can <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/10/mario-kart-world-review-a-stunning-racer-that-misses-a-few-tricks/">read my review here</a>), and as well as being a fantastic game, it doubles as an excellent technical showcase for the Switch 2. Played in 4K HDR on my TV, it looks sensational. The game moves with a crisp fluidity, and the environment feels palpably full of detail and colour. It was upon playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> that it really dawned on me that the Switch 2 was a major &#8211; and timely &#8211; graphical update on its predecessor, allowing it to keep fair pace with the technical state of gaming.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14934" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>All that graphical performance is needed to do justice to the beauty of Cow</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>All in all, whilst my test case for the Switch 2 is relatively limited for now (I haven&#8217;t played upgraded Switch games like <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em> yet either), I&#8217;m confident that the Switch 2 has delivered on the level of power I personally need in a Nintendo console. I don&#8217;t need it to be top-of-the-range; as long as the system is powerful enough to realise the trademark visual flair of first-party Nintendo games, and is able to house a strong line-up of new third-party releases, then that&#8217;s plenty for me. I eagerly await seeing what Nintendo can magic up with their bespoke Switch 2 games in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Clarity on Games: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads nicely into my next point, on the topic of the Switch 2 software line-up now and into the future. A console is defined by the games on it &#8211; and there were two particular games I was waiting for news on when I wrote that original post in March 2024. These were <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> and also the next Nintendo EAD game, which I predicted would be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game in the vein of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. We have received news on both of these games, even if the latter wasn&#8217;t quite the game I expected, as it has instead materialised as <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14932" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I am loving the vibrant purples in this art, by the way</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about <em>Metroid</em>. The development path of the long-awaited <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> has been turbulent, to say the least &#8211; after being announced back in 2017, Nintendo then publicly announced that they were restarting development in 2019, with Retro Studios (the developers of the original <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em>) coming back on board. When I wrote my post about my hopes for the Switch 2, we were still awaiting news on Metroid &#8211; but roughly three months later <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/06/19/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-18-06-2024/">in the June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, Nintendo finally showed us an announcement trailer for the newly-titled <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That initial trailer gave us a taste of the returning first-person <em>Metroid</em> gameplay and a glimpse of returning enemy Sylux, which kept fans occupied until February 2025, when it was announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM&amp;t=1631s">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> that <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> would be a cross-generation title on both Switch and Switch 2. Whilst unsurprising, this was welcome news &#8211; and roughly a month later in March, we got another Nintendo Direct trailer (see below), showing off more of the game and giving us a 2025 release date. This was followed up by an extensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9xes7BZto">Nintendo Treehouse video</a> in April, continuing the steady stream of new information on the game. However, as we enter September, we&#8217;re awaiting news on a precise release date, and I hope we hear more soon. Even if the game has to be pushed into 2026, I wouldn&#8217;t mind &#8211; after so long waiting, I&#8217;d prefer to wait a little longer if it means a better experience. What&#8217;s another few months after eight years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be fascinating to see the comparison between the Switch 2 and Switch editions of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>; the enhanced Switch 2 edition will have Joy-Con 2 mouse controls as well as support for 4K, HDR, and 120 fps! After seeing how brilliant <em>Mario Kart World</em> looks, I&#8217;m excited to experience a new <em>Metroid</em> adventure in these formats &#8211; I have a feeling the game will look sensational. So far, it appears that the game isn&#8217;t straying too far from the gameplay of previous <em>Prime </em>games, and instead refining the first-person formula, with some added tricks such as Psychic Abilities for Samus. I&#8217;m especially intrigued to see where the story goes, and am avoiding too many plot details until release!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, I thought <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was the more outlandish of the two games I was anticipating back in March 2024, as I was confident that a new 3D <em>Mario </em>from Nintendo EAD would be announced. I was both right and wrong &#8211; whilst we haven&#8217;t received a 3D <em>Mario </em>per se, we have gotten a new <em>Mario</em>-adjacent Nintendo EAD 3D game, in the form of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! This was the closing reveal in the Switch 2 Direct back in April; but it wasn&#8217;t until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Direct</a> in June that it was announced this isn&#8217;t just a Donkey Kong game, but a Pauline game as well, with a younger version of the character joining DK on his travels!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo EAD have an amazing track record, and the glowing critical reception to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>has been a continuation of this, praising the sheer gameplay creativity and enjoyment. One of the key features is the ability for Donkey Kong to smash through the environment, reshaping and even creating tunnels through it! The game released on 17th July, and I haven&#8217;t actually played it yet, as I haven&#8217;t found the time to justify spending the money on it. But now <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/">that I&#8217;ve finished the Pokémon League in <em>Pokémon Diamond</em></a> and am taking a break from that, I&#8217;ll hopefully soon get around to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, my next definite Switch 2 purchase will be <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, and I&#8217;m very tempted to get <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> too! There&#8217;s also the question about how series such as <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/10/25/where-can-zelda-go-after-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> might manifest on Switch 2, but I&#8217;m happy having patience &#8211; there are already so many other amazing games to play in the meantime!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More System Customization: No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, here we come to the first of my hopes that didn&#8217;t become a reality. The original Switch only allowed very simple customisation of the Home screen, and Switch 2 hasn&#8217;t evolved this at all, still only allowing two Themes: Basic White and Basic Black (my console is set to the latter). Having a Themes menu suggests the idea of having more options, but I&#8217;m not full of confidence, as we haven&#8217;t received any extra options since the original Switch launch in 2017.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14926" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I like neutral colours, but the option to add more flair could be fun</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not a software developer, it feels like Nintendo is missing an open goal by not allowing us to have Themes based on franchises such as <em>Mario</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, or <em>Metroid</em> &#8211; I honestly think people would even spend a small amount on these, in order to add vibrant new visuals to their systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that Nintendo could still add options in the future, but it&#8217;s disappointing that for now there&#8217;s no word on this. In my March 2024 post, I suggested extra options such as the <em>Nintendo Badge Arcade</em> sticker system on 3DS, but now I feel as if I need to keep expectations in check. At this point, even a couple extra Themes would be great to see.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14928" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Themes menu even seems designed to hold more options</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As on the original Switch, the main way of showing personality is through your profile icon. Nintendo has added extra customisation options over time, particularly via the Nintendo Switch Online menu, where you can unlock new characters, backgrounds, and frames for your profile icon. Whilst it&#8217;s a mostly unchanged process from the Switch, I&#8217;m glad this bit of customisation is still present. I imagine it won&#8217;t be too long until we get more Joy-Con 2 colours, so at least there should soon be that avenue for customising the look of your console (if you have the expendable income). Considering how popular the Switch 2 is, it&#8217;d be wonderful to see more done on the digital side to allow players to show their personality. I hope we see developments in this area in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Enhanced Social Features: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth and final entry on this list regards the social aspects of the Switch &#8211; in my original post, this was primarily about having improved voice chat functions, and thankfully, this is the main social aspect where the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade! After years (and multiple console generations) of players asking, Nintendo has finally added an in-built party voice chat to the Switch 2, named GameChat. It&#8217;s now possible to talk to your registered friends over the internet, using the in-built microphone in the Switch (and Camera, if purchased), even if they are playing different software. Whilst it isn&#8217;t revolutionary &#8211; after all, other consoles have had similar systems for a long time &#8211; it&#8217;s a welcome addition that I&#8217;m very happy to see Nintendo include for the Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous Nintendo consoles have had forms of voice chat, but they always had some sort of catch &#8211; for example on the Switch, where voice chat was tied to the Switch Online mobile app. So, it&#8217;s great to see Nintendo introduce a more complete and in-built offering &#8211; if anything, I feel a bit bad, because I doubt I&#8217;ll use it much. As the years have passed, I&#8217;ve gotten used to using Discord as an alternative form of online chat when playing Nintendo games, because it&#8217;s been more convenient &#8211; and I think it&#8217;ll be hard to break out of that routine. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m very glad GameChat has been added for the Switch 2, and I commend Nintendo for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I hoped to see some sort of extensive social hub added, along the lines of Miiverse or StreetPass. The closest is the Nintendo Switch App, which has new functionality such as uploading screenshots, receiving GameChat notifications, and (most intriguingly) interacting with games such as <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (see the images below). But I miss the in-built communal aspects of previous systems, as they brought people together without as much push towards a mobile app. We still have the News channels to get specific updates on the topics and games you choose to follow, but these are mostly one-way interactions. Nintendo has done well in previous generations at creating unique spaces for players to help shape the multiplayer culture of their consoles, but Switch and Switch 2 feel a bit more controlled in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14922" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14921" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14923" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another aspect that the Switch 2 still lacks is an equivalent to Achievements or Trophies. This is something I used to think was a glaring omission, as it would be a great extra motivation to 100% games such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/04/30/lets-chat-a-long-overdue-super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>. But <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/16/why-ive-stopped-caring-so-much-about-achievements-trophies/">as years have gone by</a>, I have gained respect for Nintendo not having this sort of system, whether it be by conscious decision or simply a lack of intention to do so. There&#8217;s something freeing about playing games on the Switch, and indeed, the Switch 2 &#8211; there&#8217;s a lack of TV/streaming apps, or completion-style Achievement/Trophy systems, and instead the focus is all on the act of playing games. That laser-focus is really refreshing, and I&#8217;m not clamouring for those additions at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, whilst I&#8217;d like to see an expansion into a more communal gaming hub in the future, the Switch 2 definitely delivered on my hope for enhanced social features. The addition of GameChat is one of the major upgrades for the Switch 2, and a lot of marketing and development focus went into it, which shows Nintendo listened to player requests for this type of addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After going through those five points, how has the Switch 2 fared when it comes to my personal hopes for the console? Four of my five points were met to some degree of success, which I mark as a win overall. Evidently, Nintendo recognised the general areas where improvements could be made &#8211; and whilst not all of them were as emphatic an upgrade as I may have hoped, the cumulative progress makes for a significant leap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarise, I&#8217;m going to rattle back through the main points. Firstly, the eShop is much easier and faster to navigate, but could still do with more options for filters and user reviews. In addition, the console is a step up in power, and whilst it isn&#8217;t at the level of modern Microsoft and Sony consoles, games look brilliant and the hardware keeps Nintendo in the ballpark for third-party games. Speaking of which, we have received welcome news on <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, and seen the release of a new exciting Nintendo EAD game in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, and now we wait for the likes of <em>Pokémon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and other franchises to launch on the console. Sadly, Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added much in the way of system customization, but it has delivered new social options in the form of GameChat, finally bringing in-built party chat to a Nintendo console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the admitted caveats to some of the &#8220;Yes&#8221; points, I want to focus on the positives of the Switch 2. This is because, despite the iterative nature of the console, it does achieve that new-console feel. I was worried that it might feel like another specification of Switch instead of a brand new thing, but there are enough upgrades to ensure that isn&#8217;t the case. Much of this is down to the optimized power of the console, and how much snappier and responsive it is to play. But another contributing factor is the hardware itself &#8211; in handheld mode, the larger form factor and sleeker Joy-Con 2 designs feels fresh and streamlined, and the console has made playing in bed (for example) feel like a delightful high-end experience. I will say, it helps that I have massive hands, so the larger console size is more comfortable for me personally.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14952" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d like to see Nintendo continue to make software improvements to the Switch 2 &#8211; for example new eShop features, new menu Themes, and extra social hubs &#8211; but I&#8217;m left with a firmly positive impression of the console overall. I&#8217;ve been getting back into playing games more frequently recently, and I&#8217;m glad to say that the Switch 2 has been a contributing factor to that; and if I&#8217;m playing more games and having a good time doing so, that marks the Switch 2 as a success in my book!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this post!

As mentioned in that post, I was part-way through my first ever play through of <em>Diamond </em>at the time of writing. Of the two initial games (<em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>), <em>Pearl </em>was the one I got back in 2007, before then playing the third game <em>Platinum </em>when it released in 2009. I’ve kept my <em>Pearl </em>save to this day, whilst <em>Platinum </em>became the game I’d restart whenever I went back to play through Sinnoh &#8211; especially as it has extra content and various quality-of-life refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I hadn’t ever played <em>Diamond </em>until I felt compelled to buy myself a copy for £48.49 from GAME back in 2019. After all, <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>are second only to <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/07/11/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> in terms of my favourite games ever, so it’s lovely to have the complete set of three physical games. I’ve been gradually playing through <em>Diamond </em>ever since; in that aforementioned 2023 post, I noted that I’d reached the trek to Snowpoint City, roughly two-thirds of the way through the game. Since then, I&#8217;ve played a little bit more each year, finishing the villainous Team Galactic part of the main story, catching the cover Legendary Pokemon Dialga, and now preparing to tackle the Pokémon League!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-12 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14830" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14828" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14829" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14806" height="715" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve played through the Sinnoh-based <em>Pokémon</em> games, and the adventure feels a little different every time, for multiple reasons: , it might be the <em>Pokémon</em> team I choose, the approach I take, or how I’m feeling in my personal life at the time. With this being my first time playing <em>Diamond</em>, it&#8217;s felt unique once again &#8211; and as I gradually get ready to reach the end of the game (and start the postgame), I thought it’d be a nice point at which to write a journal-style post about the playthrough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, this journal approach matches my new writing method I’ve been testing, where I write a little bit every day, even if it’s just a paragraph or two. It’s helped me start posting at a more regular cadence recently, which I’ve really enjoyed, and am hoping to continue! I hope you’ll come with me on my retro-inspired ramble about my current adventuring in Sinnoh, and my plan to defeat the Pokémon League with a team that might be described as unconventional&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Shine Bright Like A&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this playthrough of <em>Diamond</em>, I decided not to create my character as “William”. I often style my avatar as myself on my first playthrough of a <em>Pokémon</em> game; but as I&#8217;ve played through Sinnoh many times before, I instead went for the approach I use on repeated playthroughs. In these situations, I like to create a new character persona, in a way that challenges my team selection, mixes up the gameplay, and allows me to add my own imaginary lore. Over the years, this has often led to me constructing a monotype team (usually Steel, my favourite type), but this time I went for a dichotomy theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14797" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14795" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The character I created is called Lucie, and I think of her as treading the line between both fiery and subdued personalities. Her starter is Chimchar, which will evolve into Infernape, one of the infamously few Fire type Pokémon in the core region of Sinnoh in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em> (the Elite Four member Flint has just two Fire types in their Fire-type team)! Two of the team slots are filled by a pair of Gastrodons (named Gianna and Gillian), a Pokémon which has two forms in Sinnoh: the pink West Sea Gastrodon, and the blue East Sea Gastrodon. By having one of each, it plays into that duality theming; I think of the pink Gastrodon as part of the &#8220;bright&#8221;, flamboyant side of the team, whilst the blue Gastrodon represents the &#8220;nocturnal&#8221;, subtler side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining the West Sea Gastrodon side of the team, we have the blazing Infernape (named Symphony), as well as Raichu (Ryland) and their electrifying moves. These Pokémon both deliver fast, strong damage: for example, Close Combat and Flare Blitz for Infernape, and Thunderbolt for Raichu. On the East Sea Gastrodon side is Noctowl (Miles), which has helpful status moves such as the sleep-inducing Hypnosis, as well as Skuntank (Skylah), which has Toxic for poisoning opponents and whittling them down. As you can probably tell, I&#8217;ve always liked to daydream up my own head canon for the characters and adventure. It helps every playthrough to feel unique, as if I&#8217;m adding extra world-building along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-14 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14793" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14791" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14787" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14788" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14790" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14789" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the team described above certainly isn&#8217;t the strongest possible for <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>&#8211; and I&#8217;m aware I&#8217;m making my life more difficult when it comes to battling the toughest trainers, such as the upcoming Elite Four and Champion Cynthia. But some of these Pokémon (especially Gastrodon, Nowtowl, and Skuntank) are Pokémon I&#8217;ve barely played with before, so I get to experience the challenge of Sinnoh in a brand new way! Mixing up the team helps every playthrough to feel fresh, and strengthens my personal connection with the team &#8211; not just now, but also when I look back on them years later, such as in a longevity app like <em>Pokémon HOME</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">A Girl&#8217;s Best Friend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;ve just finished working through Victory Road, reached the entrance to the Pokémon League, and completed the final fight against your in-game rival (on a whim, I named them Mervin). Relative to other games in the series, I&#8217;d argue that Sinnoh has the best Pokémon League &#8211; the members all have distinct personalities, and present a well-balanced challenge. The difficulty isn&#8217;t unfair, but requires you to take the League seriously; I&#8217;m currently in the phase of backtracking, training up the levels of my Pokémon, and refining the movesets, items, and strategies I&#8217;m going to approach the League with. With the team I&#8217;ve selected, it requires being very deliberate with my choices &#8211; of course, the main advantage I have is that I&#8217;m particularly familiar with the challenge that lies ahead, and can plan accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-15 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14817" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14811" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14821" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14820" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14818" height="168" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216" width="216" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14799" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sinnoh Pokémon League starts with the Bug-type trainer Aaron, who should be the easiest to defeat &#8211; Bug-types have many type weaknesses, such as to Fire and Flying, which my Infernape and Noctowl can target respectively. Next up will be Bertha and her Ground-type team, which will be a tougher test &#8211; the plethora of Ground attacks will be dangerous for Infernape and Raichu, so my two Gastrodons will be relied upon to use their Water-type moves. Noctowl has a useful immunity to Ground, and Skuntank can help out with Toxic, so my team has a decent amount of options for this battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is Flint, who as mentioned earlier, is a Fire-type trainer that curiously has three non-Fire types on their team. The two that are there &#8211; Rapidash and Infernape &#8211; should again struggle against the two Gastrodons, and then the rest of my team should be able to wear down Steelix, Drifblim, and Lopunny without too much issue. Then we&#8217;ll come to Lucian, the final member of the Elite Four, who has a Psychic-type team &#8211; and this is where Skuntank will have their turn taking centre stage, as their Dark typing makes them immune to Psychic moves. With the use of Night Slash (which has an elevated critical hit rate, boosted further by the equipped Razor Claw), Skuntank should carve through a lot of the opponents, with the help of Infernape to tackle the Steel typing of Bronzong.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-16 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14808" height="542" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721" width="721" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14810" height="548" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727" width="727" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing this plan out, it makes me fairly confident at defeating the Elite Four without too much trouble. However, players of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>know that the toughest challenge lies with Champion Cynthia and her excellent team of strong and varied Pokémon (which even includes a Gastrodon of her own)! The biggest threat is her ace Pokémon &#8211; Garchomp &#8211; which can likely take out most of my team with one hit from an Earthquake. My best options are going to be my two Gastrodons, which have strong defensive stats, and can use Blizzard and Ice Beam to hit the double Ice weakness of Garchomp. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll rely on Noctowl and Hypnosis, to give myself some more time. It&#8217;s going to be a nervy battle, but there are routes to success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">In Reflection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage of the game, where I&#8217;m backtracking and gradually training up my Pokémon, showcases some of why I adore <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>so much. In theory, this part could be tiresome, gradually grinding through the experience points needed to make my team stronger &#8211; but instead, I find it tranquil. There&#8217;s something magical about the way music, visuals, and gameplay combine in these games specifically, and I enjoy taking my time; one of the main places I&#8217;m training is Victory Road, as I can access a variety of strong wild Pokémon there. Near the entrance is a useful Pokémon Center for healing your team, and I often pause to listen to the &#8220;Pokémon League&#8221; music that plays outside it. This particular track has both &#8220;Day&#8221; and &#8220;Night&#8221; versions, and the latter is especially beautiful (you can listen below). It&#8217;s a beautifully delicate composition, and captures the feeling of being near the end of an amazing adventure, but with so much still left to enjoy, and no need to rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to this music is just one example of the catharsis I feel when playing <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, which is something I talked about back in my 2023 post. This sentiment comes from a place of both subjectivity and objectivity, as my emotional connection to these games is incredibly strong. After my older sister passed away in 2007, I spent hundreds of hours exploring Sinnoh, and I&#8217;m forever grateful to the soothing effect they had &#8211; and still have &#8211; on me. There are many positive aspects I associate with this: the meticulous sprite artwork and colour palette; the endearing Pokémon and character designs; the region full of secrets to explore; the sprawling Underground; and that amazing soundtrack, just to name a handful of reasons why I love these games so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I prepare to enter the Pokémon League, I&#8217;ve also started thinking about the postgame, which in <em>Diamond </em>includes a whole separate island northeast of Sinnoh, named the Battle Zone (see the map below). It includes the Fight Area, Resort Area, and Survival Area, plus Stark Mountain. The Fight Area includes the Battle Tower in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>, which is less extensive than the expanded Battle Frontier in <em>Platinum</em>, but still offers plenty of challenge and longevity. I love the sheer amount of space left to discover in the postgame; this island is like an extra enclosed region to explore. Currently, I&#8217;m undecided on whether I&#8217;ll dive straight into this after the Pokémon League, or take a break and come back at a later time.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14813" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I&#8217;m well acquainted with the celebratory feel of the Battle Zone island, and may well get drawn into playing it immediately! After the high of defeating the Pokémon League, it&#8217;s wonderful to realise there&#8217;s still so much left for your Pokémon and you to explore. The Battle Zone has a vacation vibe, especially as you initially take a ship to get there &#8211; and the music is also uplifting and energetic, for example Route 225, which feels like a burst of energy, complete with the iconic clapping (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQvx9STW1V0">go to 00:42 in this video</a>)! Overall, the Battle Zone has a celebratory feel, and adds a lot to the overall package of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. I&#8217;m excited for the character of Lucie to extend her adventure, and take her dual-themed team onwards and upwards!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Space and Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope with this post is that it shone a light on two things: the reasons that set this playthrough of <em>Diamond </em>apart, and more detail on why I have such a strong connection to <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. They are such special games to me personally, and for a long time, I&#8217;ve considered how to do that connection justice on this site. The 2023 post was a very cathartic one for me to write, and this post is an extension of that. It&#8217;s amazing how our personal circumstances can affect our thoughts on games (and other forms of media) &#8211; and I love hearing about these stories from other people too, as it often sparks positive discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14850" height="514" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827" width="827" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that down the line, I get to write another post about <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, talking about how the character of Lucie faced the Pokémon League, and then ventured into the postgame and Battle Zone. Down the line, I&#8217;ll likely inevitably play <em>Pokémon Platinum</em> again, and that&#8217;ll continue to be the game I go back to for replaying Sinnoh.

This is the first brand new <em>Mario Kart</em> on consoles since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> on Wii U back in 2014 (the Switch received an upgraded version, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, in 2017, which I skipped) &#8211; so at least for me personally, it&#8217;s felt a long time coming. Mixed in with the excitement of a brand new Nintendo console, it made the launch of <em>Mario Kart World</em> feel like a real event, especially when played with friends, which is where <em>Mario Kart</em> always excels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, in various different configurations: both on the TV and in handheld, in solo, local co-op, and online with a friend. Now, I&#8217;ve reached a point where I feel I can state a comprehensive opinion on the game, having experienced both the racing modes and the open world that&#8217;s a major selling point of this iteration of <em>Mario Kart</em>. My thoughts are overall very positive, but there are also some flawed aspects to the game  &#8211; but I&#8217;ll expand upon this more later on in the review. Without further ado then, let&#8217;s get into it!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Start Your Engines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it was the new-console glow, or perhaps it was that wait since <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, but launching into <em>Mario Kart World</em> for the first time felt distinctly special. The game encourages you straight into exploring the open world first; this consists of the various tracks connected by open spaces of road, field, water, desert, and more. What&#8217;s immediately remarkable about the game is just how gorgeous it looks, both in handheld but also especially when played on a 4K HDR TV &#8211; and whilst this isn&#8217;t new technology, it&#8217;s wonderful to play Nintendo games in such high fidelity via the Switch 2. The visual direction of <em>Mario Kart World</em> makes brilliant use of the new hardware, presenting a world full of vibrancy, colour, and personality &#8211; which is shown in the track designs, whether it&#8217;s the bustling Shy Guy Bazaar, the scrumptious Sky-High Sundae, or the fiery Bowser&#8217;s Castle, just to name three!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-17 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14727" height="574" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mkw_sgb_view.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14724" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14725" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_17.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The infused personality is evident in the roster of characters (complete with various different unlockable outfits). Returning are your usual suspects like Mario, Luigi, Peach, and so forth; additionally, there are plenty of newcomers, including minor enemies such as Konkdor and Cataquack, and even bit-part characters such as Dolphin and, of course, Cow! If you&#8217;ve seen any discourse about <em>Mario Kart World</em> since the initial announcement, you&#8217;ll know that the Cow and their adorable grin has captured the attention of the internet, and I&#8217;ve had a wonderful time watching the various memes and edits their inclusion has spawned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the characters have a range of changeable outfits too, which are unlocked by collecting Dash Food bags from vendors in races or the open world. It adds an extra way to differentiate the characters, ranging from punk rock biker looks to desert outfits and much more in between &#8211; and they can be combined with the plentiful different karts and bikes to create the aesthetic you&#8217;re looking for. A Photo Mode has been added in tandem with this, giving plentiful options for taking pictures that show off the world and characters as you see fit. Me being me, I&#8217;m sad that we got an Explorer outfit Toad but no actual Captain Toad&#8230; But there&#8217;s always time for that in DLC, hopefully!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14754" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A smorgasbord of Yoshi! Or Yoshis? Yoshies?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The attention to detail in both audio and graphic effects is especially apparent when you build up speed. Karts and bikes camber side-to-side when they hop and drift; tyres are spongey and visibly bounce and recoil according to the track surface; and sparks crackle off your vehicle as you drift and build up a boost, just to name a small handful of the details I&#8217;m talking about. I particularly like the tension of drifting around the sharpest corners, with the screen often tilting with you and making it extra satisfying to hit the apex. Plus, the music is noticeably exceptional, supplying a consistently energetic chorus that accentuates the gameplay &#8211; especially in the final unlockable tracks, which supply a climactic crescendo unlike any other I&#8217;ve experienced in <em>Mario Kart</em>. Overall, the whole experience is lifted by this pristine look and feel, whether it&#8217;s the relatively laid-back open world, or the competitive modes, where the palpable sense of momentum is most gripping. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a Knockout!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the &#8220;World&#8221; being a key selling point of the game, it&#8217;s still those core competitive modes that retained the tightest grip on my attention. Whilst the expected familiar selection of Grand Prix, custom VS, Battle, and Time Trial modes are all here, the game deserves credit for also introducing a brand new main mode to go alongside Grand Prix. This goes by the name of Knockout Tour, where 6 different tracks are combined together into one extra-long race. It takes advantage of the increased count of 24 racers to introduce checkpoint gates along the way, eliminating those at the back each time. Essentially, it&#8217;s a way of introducing popular battle royale-esque sensibilities into <em>Mario Kart</em>, and it creates a very fun sense of chaos &#8211; especially in local multiplayer, when your friends and you are desperately trying to stay in the race amidst the various items flying around!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14736" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A road trip across the Mushroom Kingdom! Thankfully, less traffic jams than real life</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Knockout Tours are arguably the biggest challenge awaiting completionist solo players in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It&#8217;s classic knowledge now that to get the maximum 3-star rating in Grand Prix, you need to win all four races; but in Knockout Tour, you need to be leading through every single checkpoint! This is an extremely tough task, as it necessitates not just victory, but to be consistently leading &#8211; even despite homing Red Shells, or the dreaded blue Spiny Shells that target the leader. I set myself the personal challenge of 3-starring every Knockout Tour, and it led to many failed attempts, but it was highly satisfying when I finally achieved that goal. For <em>Mario Kart</em> veterans, it&#8217;s a good addition to have a target that takes this extra level of dedication to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just mentioned the items and the chaos synonymous with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and that side of the game is just as entertaining (and frustrating) as ever before! To me, <em>Mario Kart</em> is similar to other games such as <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> because at their core, each iteration is built on the same gameplay loop, and it makes it tough to critique a new entry &#8211; on one hand, it&#8217;d be unwise to stray too far from what makes the series so immensely popular, but on the other, there has to be enough new ideas to justify a new game that still feels imaginative.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-18 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14737" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14738" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14740" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As aforementioned, the Knockout Tours are a standout way in which <em>Mario Kart World</em> achieves the latter, and some of these ideas bleed over into Grand Prix, where you don&#8217;t just drive around four tracks &#8211; instead, after the first race, the initial laps are rolling starts, as you drive across the world to the next track, road-trip style. It&#8217;s a neat way to keep the same formula but match it to the open-world aesthetic of <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and in VS there are options to play either in this mode, or with the traditional laps, catering to either preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further to this, there are tweaks to the racing itself, the most notable arguably being the new parkour/trick abilities. If you drive up onto a rail, you can grind along it and perform extra trick boosts, and you can even trick onto a wall and wall-ride along it, which opens up jaw-dropping shortcuts if you master this ability (there are plenty of astonishing clips doing the rounds online)! On top of this, drifting boosts can now be used in a straight line, and launch you off the ground slightly to help initiate some of these parkour moves. In combination, all these extra options elevate the height of the skill ceiling, and keep <em>Mario Kart World</em> engaging for those who have mastered previous entries in the series. Crucially, it does this without losing the accessibility as a go-to local multiplayer party game &#8211; the extra skills are a cherry on top for those who want to go above and beyond, but they&#8217;re not essential for winning races against the CPU.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14755" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Boo Cinema is another standout track, which applies a film filter to part of the course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Items are one of the infamous levellers of <em>Mario Kart</em>, and there have been some tweaks and additions on this front too. Your usual roster of shells, bananas, and mushrooms, and more are all here, although it&#8217;s noticeable that the raw power of items such as Bullet Bill have been slightly softened, perhaps to accommodate the new racer count of 24. Some of the notable new items include the golden Coin Shell, which leaves a trail of coins behind it, and the feather, which leaps you into the air, opening another opportunity to perform tricks, wallrides, and other shortcuts. To more literally aid more inexperienced players, there are still the helpful options for motion controls, auto-accelerate, and driving aids. Whilst these aren&#8217;t new, they&#8217;re still great to see return, and are often essential for balanced 4-player sessions that everyone can enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Give Me a Boost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As fun as <em>Mario Kart</em> can be in solo play, multiplayer is where the series has always shined brightest, and that continues to be the case for <em>World</em>. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to play with several combinations of friends, and the game has impressively accommodated their varying levels of <em>Mario Kart</em> experience each time, whether they&#8217;re a fresh newcomer or someone who&#8217;s been away from the series for a while. It&#8217;s easy to criticize the items when they&#8217;re hitting you, but they do a great job at helping those towards the back stay with the pack, and there&#8217;s still the option to use items such as shells and bananas defensively whilst in the lead.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14743" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Expect to shout at your friends &#8211; in a pleasant way, of course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Local multiplayer has consistently resulted in a brilliant time, complete with the playful shouting, cheers, and competitive back-and-forth that you hope for from <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; so I can report that it&#8217;s a success in that department! My favourite local multiplayer option is the extended custom VS modes, which have plenty of customisable options, including speed, difficulty, item frequency, and the amount of races, which go up to 32 at a time. As a big Formula 1 fan, I love to nerd out about the accumulated points and the drama of how the final standings will end up, so VS will inevitably become my most-played mode!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of online play, <em>Mario Kart World</em> doesn&#8217;t quite hit the same heights as local multiplayer, because of that lack of immediate in-person reaction &#8211; and whilst it&#8217;s admirable that Nintendo has added chat functionality, I did end up defaulting to using a Discord call instead, because of the familiarity and ease of use. The main motivation to play online is to raise your versus rating (VR), which is essentially the same system we had way back on <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>. In my opinion, it&#8217;s disappointing that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added more reasons to play online, especially in a gaming landscape where online games consistently add new modes, tournaments, and other rewards for playing consistently. The end result is that I quickly fell off of online multiplayer, and have focused mostly on solo and local multiplayer.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14753" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Driving on water supplies opportunity to perform tricks as you bounce over the waves</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, I found that the returning Battle Mode was most ideal for multiplayer &#8211; in <em>World</em>, there are two options, Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, which will be familiar to players of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. Balloon Battle gives you five balloons to protect whilst doing your best to hit opponents and earn points for removing their balloons, and Coin Runners has you searching for as many coins as you can, whilst again attempting to hit others and remove their coins (whilst avoiding them doing the same to you). I have to say, I&#8217;ve never been a huge Battle Mode fan over the years, and this version hasn&#8217;t changed that &#8211; but conversely, if you love Battle Mode, this will fill that quota well. My main disappointment is that the modes are time-based instead of score-based, as I generally prefer having that concrete target and the tension of seeing who can reach it first. Despite my criticisms, I am glad Battle Mode is back, as it offers a welcome change of pace from the racing modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Free as a Birdo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, a major differentiator for <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the inclusion of a free roam mode, where you can explore the tracks (and the spaces between them) at your leisure. There&#8217;s certainly an immediate novelty to this &#8211; I have nostalgic memories of <em>LEGO Racers 2</em>, which I played a lot on PC as a child, and included a similar experience of exploring an open world between races in a colourful, family-friendly world. My hope was that <em>Mario Kart World</em> might recapture that whimsical feeling, and supply a world with plenty of secrets and rewards, and most importantly motivation to find them. At first, <em>World </em>is successful in this; one of my earliest ventures was rocking up to the Dino Dino Jungle area, and visiting the inner laboratory/auditorium section. With precise driving and the careful use of tricks, you can make your way to the top of this area &#8211; which is thrilling the first time, but soon the realisation kicks in that there&#8217;s a lack of reason to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-19 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14746" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14747" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14745" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in free roam,<em> Mario Kart World </em>has an uncanny sense of emptiness, and it&#8217;s partly because that palpable sense of forward energy &#8211; which is so prevalent in the competitive modes &#8211; is gone, without being replaced by much else. It&#8217;s not that there isn&#8217;t anything to do in the open world &#8211; for example, there are Peach Medallions and Question Mark Panels to find, as well as P Switches that activate various challenges &#8211; but the problem is that there isn&#8217;t much motivation to track all these things down. The main rewards are stickers, which are small graphic icons you can attach next to your profile name, and feel inconsequential. More work needed to be done to make the world feel alive, and not just like a suspended state of limbo from the Grand Prix mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toads and Shy Guys milling around and making campfires are a great touch, but they&#8217;re another short-lived novelty that doesn&#8217;t add substance to the experience of navigating the open world. It&#8217;s fun to find items and complete challenges, but they&#8217;re incredibly scattered &#8211; and whilst there&#8217;s a tracker for the Question Mark Panels, there&#8217;s curiously no in-game indicator for how many Medallions or Switches are left to find (and also no statistics or records screen for other modes, either). On the other hand, something free roam does do well is increasing the level of awe the world has. You can travel a long way out into the ocean, and discover sea dragons, whales, and more, and I had a great time inspecting the scale of impressive courses such as DK Spaceport. As mentioned at the start of the review, <em>Mario Kart World</em> is a stunning game to look at and listen to, and the open world gives you more time to do just that.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14748" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>P Switch challenges often consist of time trials</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s a great shame that there&#8217;s no formal splitscreen multiplayer for the open world &#8211; there&#8217;s a partial workaround, by loading into an empty wireless mode lobby, but challenges are turned off, and it&#8217;s not at all optimal. In a game marketed on free roam, and in a series known for local multiplayer, it&#8217;s a disappointing oversight that significantly reduces the reason to play this way. I have occasionally played free roam in single-player as a laid-back secondary experience, for example when listening to a podcast or talking to friends &#8211; but it has untapped potential as a playground for friends to enjoy together, and honestly, I think this would&#8217;ve papered over many of my problems with the emptiness of the open world. Instead, more often than not, you&#8217;ll launch straight into Grand Prix, Knockout Tour, or VS, as that is where the most joyous parts of <em>Mario Kart World</em> reside.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to the end of this review, I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;ve flagged multiple issues I have with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; so I need to re-emphasize that this is a genuinely excellent <em>Mario Kart</em> game, that not only delivers the best-looking and best-sounding entry into the series, but has multiple new ideas and modes that make it feel distinct. Changeable character outfits, new trick mechanics, and especially the Knockout Tour mode supply fresh style that have made <em>World </em>my new go-to local multiplayer game, and a game I&#8217;ve spent many an enjoyable hour in by myself as well. The main disappointment has to be the free roam mode, which feels sparse and quickly struggles to retain player attention &#8211; and I really hope that in the future, Nintendo supports the game with additional content that fills out this world more. Alternatively, add Captain Toad to the playable characters, and I&#8217;ll probably be happy, haha! In all seriousness, <em>Mario Kart World</em> definitely has flaws, but the core racing experience is dazzling, and it&#8217;s a superb way to start the Switch 2 era!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

I&#8217;ve written about this in multiple posts on this site, and I&#8217;ve noticed how I&#8217;m gradually getting deeper into the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> ecosystem: starting with looking back to the anime, and then playing the online game <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and now getting more invested in learning about the current meta and competitive side of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> is a complicated game with lots to learn (and relearn) for someone like me, who hasn&#8217;t been up-to-date on the meta since I stopped playing local tournaments about a decade-and-a-half-ago. But I&#8217;m slowly learning, and I&#8217;m enjoying how it&#8217;s happening naturally, via watching various YouTube creators, playing different decks in <em>Master Duel</em>, and even constructing a real-life deck that I could conceivably return to local tournaments with. So, in this post, I&#8217;m going to talk a little more about these various aspects of the game, the deck I&#8217;m playing, and why I&#8217;m enjoying this process so much!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Getting the Fire (Kings) Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve already written about <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/12/31/why-im-giving-yu-gi-oh-master-duel-another-shot/">how I&#8217;ve gotten back into <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em></a>, but only now have I reached the point where I&#8217;m starting to understand the competitive meta. At first, I was playing relatively low-powered (by current standards) decks such as Dark Magician and Monarchs, because those cards were familiar to me. But realistically, those decks aren&#8217;t fast-paced enough to keep up nowadays, so I started testing other avenues. I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of Gravekeepers, which can sometimes work in the competitive scene, if you draw the right cards (such as Necrovalley) in order to shut off abilities from the opponent. But this wasn&#8217;t a strategy that was going to help me learn the competitive game long-term, and I found that I eventually reached a point of repetition and subsequent burnout playing the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-20 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14664" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14665" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14666" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gravekeepers brought me a decent level of success!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This brought me to the HERO cards, especially Destiny HEROs, as I have a nostalgic affinity for them. The modern HERO cards have many combo effects that special summon various powerful cards, so they were much more helpful for learning the increased modern speed of combos in a deck. But I still found the HERO cards to lack flexibility for different situations, and I again reached a point where I hit a brick wall with the deck. It felt like I had hit also hit a wall in my efforts to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> in a contemporary fashion, as I couldn&#8217;t find a deck I clicked with. So I took a bit of a break from <em>Master Duel</em>, and started looking into which decks would be viable to assemble if I was playing the physical TCG (Trading Card Game). After looking at various Structure Decks as starting points, I finally found one which made sense to test out: Fire Kings!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire Kings are a deck based around monsters that destroy themselves either on the field, in the hand, or from the deck, to then activate various effects, including summoning monsters and destroying cards on the field. In addition, they have an impressive boss monster in &#8220;Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings&#8221;, which can destroy every other monster on the field (and has a magnificent summoning animation in <em>Master Duel</em>, see below)! The fiery aesthetic of these cards is well-realised in the stunning artwork, which mixes regal distinction with blazing power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-21 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14678" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14674" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14676" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14677" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14675" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Master Duel summon animations are, in a word, awesome</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the cards are relatively accessible in the real world, with only &#8220;Fire King Courtier Ulcanix&#8221; demanding a higher price point (of about £15 a copy). Most of the main Fire King cards can be acquired in the modestly priced Fire King Structure Deck &#8211; I bought three copies of this, as well as some other products (such as the recent Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Deck, which includes reprints of staple cards such as Infinite Impermanence), to construct a real-life Fire King deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, I find it helpful to have a real deck in front of me, which I can draw test hands with to slowly understand the playstyle better (I&#8217;m hoping for a reprint of Ulcanix, so I don&#8217;t have to drop £45-ish on a playset)! The result of this process is finally finding an archetype I like, which is viable to build in both <em>Master Duel</em> and the TCG &#8211; and to top it all off, Fire Kings are competitively strong too! Whilst they aren&#8217;t currently considered a top tier deck like Maliss or Ryzeal, Fire Kings do perform well in current competitive play, even winning the YCS Birmingham event this year, piloted by Dinh-Kha Bui! This tells me that if I can improve my own skill and understanding of the deck, then Fire King can reach a high ceiling of play in both <em>Master Duel</em> and local tournaments (should I decide to go&#8230; More on that later)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14669" height="696" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>It needs some changes still, but my TCG Fire King deck is taking shape!</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m playing lots of Fire King in Ranked games on <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and with every game, every new scenario, and every mistake I make (I&#8217;m admittedly still making a lot of those), I&#8217;m learning the intricacies of the deck, how to perform the best combos, and how to make the strongest boards in combination with my Extra Deck of Link, XYZ, and Synchro Monsters. I like how Fire Kings have such a strong Fire connection, which enables them to make use of several non-Fire cards as additions to the deck. For example, a common choice for Fire Kings is &#8220;Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames&#8221;, which can revive back one of your Fire Kings alongside it when summoned. This synergy is very satisfying, and ties into the overall theme of the deck, resulting in an archetype that feels richly-designed and well-realised. I&#8217;m enjoying learning the Fire King strategies, and I hope that by my next <em>Master Duel</em> post on this site, I can report that I&#8217;ve become steadily better at piloting the deck!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Creators I Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside my own proactive efforts to become better at contemporary <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I&#8217;ve been watching several YouTube creators that are a brilliant source of both entertainment and knowledge for me. <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/">In previous posts, I&#8217;ve mentioned</a> how TGS Anime and Team APS helped me get reacquainted with classic <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, which lines up with my aforementioned play of anime decks such as Dark Magician. I still watch these channels, but I&#8217;ve added several others to my regular watchlist, including the &#8220;wonky quartet&#8221; of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGuDrveqBgD0S9nqaOPw6Q">Farfa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MBTYuGiOh">MBT</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Nyhmnim">Nyhmnim</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dzeeff">Dzeeff</a>, who consistently create great content focused primarily around <em>Master Duel</em>. Often, they add fun variables to challenge themselves, such as in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xajsij7iS98">Master Chef</a> series by MBT, or the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbldWY88--A">Storage Wars</a> series by Farfa.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Videos like this (by Joshua Schmidt) are brilliant at showcasing both the fun and skill of </em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly thanks to these channels and their collaborations, I&#8217;ve also become aware of other popular YouTubers &#8211; specifically, ones focused around high-level competitive play. These are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaSchmidtYGO">Joshua Schmidt</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jessekottonygo">Jesse Kotton</a>, who are well-known for often winning or placing highly in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> tournaments. Both of them balance speaking confidently about modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> with also making videos that are fun to watch, which is very impressive and makes them stand out. Both their channels have been helpful to me, and I also like it when they have those earlier-mentioned collaborations with channels like Farfa and MBT, as they bring a little bit of extra seriousness to those videos. Discovering this range of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> players and creators has been an unexpected extra positive side effect of getting back into the game and franchise!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">It&#8217;s Time to Duel?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;ve talked about how I&#8217;ve not just been looking at the digital version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> (with <em>Master Duel</em>), but also my physical collection of cards as well. I have a fairly large amount of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> cards, mostly from my childhood and teenage years, and further supplemented with occasional more recent purchases when something has stood out to me. Those Fire King and Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Decks have given me access to plenty of modern cards to assemble a deck with, and I also picked up products like the Duel Devastator set from 2019, which was full of guaranteed competitive staples like &#8220;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&#8221;. This is all to say that I&#8217;m nearing a place where not only am I improving at <em>Master Duel</em>, but I could conceivably go to an in-person event near me and test out my skills in person (scary, I know, haha)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14673" height="672" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Recent structure decks have been ideal for helping me build Fire Kings</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Jokes aside, there&#8217;s only a few things stopping me from doing this, and one of them is overcoming that social anxiety. I&#8217;ve become better at this over the years, but I definitely find the initial ice-breaking of heading to a new club/group quite daunting. About a year ago, I also experienced this when joining a nearby running club &#8211; there is that initial awkward stage of getting to know people and faces, but it gets easier over time. I&#8217;m confident that this wouldn&#8217;t be a long-term issue, especially as I now know a friend who has introduced me to a local store that hosts Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next barrier is more closely related to the theme of this post &#8211; and that&#8217;s a personal target to be relatively well-acquainted with the game before showing up to a local tournament again. I&#8217;m definitely nearing this stage, and part of this preparation would be making the finishing touches to my Fire King deck. I&#8217;d like to get that playset of three Fire King Courtier Ulcanix first, as they&#8217;re integral to the strength of the deck. The card is out of stock on most sites, and my best route currently seems to be waiting for a good UK price on Cardmarket. I could wait and hope for a cheaper reprint, but there is no sign of this happening at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jesse Kotton has a video about Fire Kings and their affordability</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I&#8217;d like to get a copy of some extra staple Extra Deck cards such as &#8220;S:P Little Knight&#8221;, and possibly acquire some extra non-Fire King cards that often seen play in the deck, such as &#8220;Bystial Magnamhut&#8221; and &#8220;Bystial Druisworm&#8221;. The main thing I&#8217;m keeping an eye on is price &#8211; for example, in an ideal world I&#8217;d also add competitively strong cards such as &#8220;Mulcharmy Fuwalos&#8221; to the deck, but that would cost another £70-ish for a playset, and I haven&#8217;t even gone to a local event yet (I do have a tendency for overthinking)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve still not decided if I&#8217;ll make the time to make the leap to playing the TCG in-person again, but I&#8217;m getting increasingly tempted to have a go. It would enable me to test out my skills, and it could also be a way to make new friends and connections. When I went to local events in my teenage years, I enjoyed the trading side of the game too &#8211; and who knows, perhaps that&#8217;s a better way to acquire some of these missing cards for my Fire King deck. If I do decide to go, I hope to write up about my experience on this site, however well (or badly, haha) it goes!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the third <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> centric post I&#8217;ve written over the last 8 months, and they&#8217;re good reflections of how I&#8217;ve gotten back into the franchise as a whole: not just my nostalgic connection, but how I&#8217;ve been learning about the modern game and how it&#8217;s evolved over time. I admittedly used to be someone who lamented that <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> had become too complicated and suffered from power creep &#8211; and whilst those aren&#8217;t completely untrue, I think they were oversimplifications on my part. Having now taken the time to ingrain myself back into the world of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I see that the game has developed into something new &#8211; something faster, more complex, and in some ways arguably better than before.</p>\n\n\n\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top: 75%;">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this post has explained how I&#8217;m pushing myself to get better at the game, with the conduit of a Fire King deck as my resource for playing the game at a higher skill level than before. I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn still, both about this deck and other decks, but I&#8217;m having an excellent time doing so &#8211; which is probably evidenced by me considering playing the TCG in-person again at some point in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this post, and I sincerely hope you are happy, healthy, and having a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/03/how-fire-kings-are-helping-me-learn-competitive-play-in-yu-gi-oh-master-duel/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Right then, let&#8217;s get into the post, and I hope you enjoy the read!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Edinburgh Marathon 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/">my build-up and training for the Edinburgh Marathon</a> multiple times since I started planning in November 2024, and after a train journey up to Edinburgh and a couple of days in the city, on May 25th 2025 the day finally arrived for my first marathon! My parents and some close friends were there to support me, and I also had the support of all those who contributed to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">my charity fundraiser for Beat</a> (the Eating Disorder charity). Thank you to everyone who donated or even just took a look at my Justgiving page &#8211; I&#8217;m really proud to spread awareness for a charity that means a lot to both my family and I.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14636" height="607" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So, you may be asking, how did the marathon go? It was a tough one, and Scotland threw all the elements at us. There were periods of sun, rain, strong winds, and even hail when I reached approximately mile 20! As expected, the last 10-ish miles are where the battle really begins, as much mental as physical. It was important to me that I do my absolute best and never stop or walk if I can help it, and at mile 25 I got to see my friends and family cheer me on as I neared the finish line!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was an unexpectedly dramatic finish. With the finish line in sight, and as I pushed for the line with maybe 100 metres left to go, I was struck with the notorious &#8220;jelly legs&#8221; and fell. I managed to get back to my feet with the help of another nearby runner, and made it to the line. As someone who is very critical of themselves, I was disappointed at not finishing the run in better style &#8211; and this is where my family and friends were invaluable at stopping me from being too harsh on myself. It was a great reminder of how much they care for me and how much support I had on the day, and I am incredibly grateful to them and everyone else who has congratulated me since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-22 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14624" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Early on&#8230; !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14622" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the race</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14623" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final stretch!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Including Gift Aid, we raised £1,821.77 for Beat, and I&#8217;m very proud of this, as well as the personal achievement of finishing the marathon. I&#8217;m still deciding whether or not to do another marathon &#8211; after not finishing in quite the way I hoped, I am feeling motivated to do another one, maybe the Norfolk Marathon in 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest gaming news stories over the last few months has been the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. As not only a gaming fan but also specifically a Nintendo fan, I got my console immediately, and have been playing it a significant amount since! Whilst it&#8217;s more of an iteration than a revolution in terms of hardware, I personally enjoy the larger console and screen size, as it fits my larger hands very well. The only exclusive game I have so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I&#8217;ve put many an hour into!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14620" height="534" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, <em>Mario Kart World</em> feels like the first new entry since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> many years ago, as I played a lot of the latter on Wii U and never felt the need to buy the <em>Deluxe</em> version on Switch. Therefore, <em>World</em> feels very fresh to me, and it&#8217;s also visually spectacular (especially on a big 4K HDR TV). I&#8217;ve 3-starred all the Grand Prix and am now working away at the Knockout Tours, which are battle-royale style checkpoint races new to this game. These Knockout Tours are very tough to get 3-stars on, but I&#8217;m enjoying the challenge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a few criticisms of the game &#8211; including my own biased disappointment at no inclusion of Captain Toad, haha &#8211; but also about the open-world twist on the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula. In concept, it&#8217;s a smart way to go, but I have mixed feelings on the execution, as the world feels a little empty and repetitive to explore. Despite this, I&#8217;m going to save my full thoughts, as I plan to write a dedicated review at some point soon. One thing is for sure, and that&#8217;s <em>Mario Kart World</em> being the new go-to local multiplayer game for my friends and I!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the Switch 2 itself, it does feel like an investment for the future, as outside of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and now <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> (which I hope to play soon), there&#8217;s a lack of headline exclusive titles. But for now, the hardware upgrade and promise for the future &#8211; plus the fun of <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; has made it feel worth the purchase for this Nintendo fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-text-align-left">My watching habits have been quite eclectic recently! In terms of the films, the standout has to be <em>Superman</em> &#8211; as a huge DC fan, I had high hopes for this fresh, brighter take on the iconic character, and James Gunn and company thoroughly delivered. The film is a shining beacon of positivity, fun, and creativity, and David Corenswet is a brilliant Superman to centre the new DCU around. I&#8217;m very excited to see where things go in the future, but for now I&#8217;m just so happy that we got a satisfyingly hopeful take on Superman again. I&#8217;m hoping that these vibes continue in <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> on the Marvel side, which I&#8217;m going to see tomorrow as of writing this!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-23 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14617" height="1023" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg?w=819" width="819" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14618" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg?w=691" width="691" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of TV, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to <em>The Walking Dead</em> (I really liked the recent film <em>28 Years Later</em>, and I think it&#8217;s helped put me in the zombie mood). I originally stopped watch <em>The Walking Dead</em> in Season 8, which is where a lot of people dropped off, in the war between Rick and Negan. However, I heard that it picks up afterwards, so I decided to go back, charge through Season 8, and see what I find in those last few seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst Season 8 remains a poorly-paced season, I&#8217;m glad I went back, especially because Season 9 is brilliant TV. Clearly lessons were learned from the negative reception to previous seasons, and Season 9 focuses back on character development, inventive new threats, and grounded emotional stakes. It hooked me in and I&#8217;m enjoying the ride of these last few seasons!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m already looking ahead to watching the newer <em>The Walking Dead</em> spin-offs such as <em>The Ones Who Live</em> and <em>Daryl Dixon</em>, to see where these characters end up. Other than <em>The Walking Dead</em>, I&#8217;m also slowly making my way through the latest Marvel show <em>Ironheart</em>, which hasn&#8217;t been marketed very well by Disney &#8211; which is a shame, as it&#8217;s very well-made and full of great performances.  To loop back around to <em>Superman</em> and the DCU, I&#8217;m also eagerly anticipating <em>Peacemaker</em> Season 2, which will tie into that film and the larger world!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this summation of some of what I&#8217;ve been up to recently! One of my goals for the rest of the year is to start writing here more consistently &#8211; I&#8217;ve been saying this for a while, but it&#8217;s something I really want to get back to. It&#8217;s been necessary for me to spend more time on my personal life and take breaks from writing, but in the process of that personal growth, it&#8217;s reminded me how much I like writing about the things I play, watch, and do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I often get distracted or hit writer&#8217;s block, so I&#8217;m considering the approach of setting aside a little bit of time every day to write with no background music/videos, as opposed to my previous strategy of writing in big time chunks all at once. Either way, I&#8217;m planning to be more present on here in the second half of the year, and I look forward to it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sincerely hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a wonderful day!

Many hours of my weekends have been devoted to building up my distance; I am a longtime runner, but had never ran more than a half-marathon before my marathon training this year. Last weekend I did my longest run, a 23.2-miler (my poor legs), and I&#8217;m now tapering down before the big day. My mental health has been low recently, and the marathon has been a good target for my mind to try and focus on, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14584" height="560" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025"><em>https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m both excited and nervous for the event, for which I will be journeying to Edinburgh a few days beforehand. I&#8217;m also doing the run to fundraise for <a href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/">Beat, the Eating Disorder charity</a> &#8211; this is a cause close to my heart, as my amazing sister Charlotte passed away in 2007 after battling anorexia. As aforementioned in my previous post, you can view my Justgiving page <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">at this link</a>, and any donations would be very much appreciated, but there&#8217;s no pressure at all to donate!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Upcoming Book Projects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a designer for Titan Books, I get to work on some really exciting projects, and honestly that fulfilment in my work means a lot to me &#8211; it&#8217;s very rewarding to have a physical product of your work, especially when it&#8217;s related to a property (such as Marvel or <em>Star Trek</em>) that you enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get to experience working on several exciting film retrospectives, and some upcoming ones from Titan include books on <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>,<em> </em>The Crow films, and <em>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</em>, which you can see covers for below!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-24 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14562" height="904" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706" width="706" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14564" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800" width="800" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14563" height="927" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of fiction, the final Mike Hammer novel <em>Baby, It&#8217;s Murder</em> released recently, and there are upcoming Marvel paperbacks for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Annihilation</em> and <em>Doctor Strange: Dimension Wa</em>r.

I&#8217;m very impressed by what was shown, and have my pre-order in for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. Whilst I like physical media, I can&#8217;t justify that high £74.99 price point for buying <em>Mario Kart</em> separately. Those game prices are the main criticism so far &#8211; the only other hesitation is seeing Nintendo choose surety over innovation in terms of hardware. I&#8217;m confident the Switch 2 will be a huge hit, but I do slightly miss those eclectic reveals of the Wii U, 3DS, Wii, DS, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what I&#8217;m playing, I&#8217;ve been struggling with burnout and game-playing-motivation recently, so haven&#8217;t played much. I have however briefly gotten back into<em> Bravely Default</em> on the DS (which ironically has a Switch 2 version coming soon), and continue to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel </em>now and then. I&#8217;m hoping my game-playing motivation returns soon, but am also not putting too much pressure on myself, as I don&#8217;t want to force it. I look forward to the Switch 2 hopefully reigniting that fire a bit &#8211; oh, and please add Captain Toad to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, Nintendo! It would make me very happy indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve admittedly struggled to get back into games recently &#8211; but when it comes to TV, I&#8217;ve been keeping more up-to-date, and there&#8217;s a lot that I&#8217;ve been liking recently! The second season of <em>Andor </em>and second (or fifteenth, depending on how you count) season of <em>Doctor Who</em> are currently airing, and both are fantastic. <em>Andor </em>continues the engrossing drama and brilliantly tangible visual design of the first season, and this era of <em>Doctor Who</em> is really hitting a stride, with unexpected surprises amidst the brilliantly imaginative stories. I really hope the rumours of <em>Doctor Who</em> taking a break after this season are false, as Ncuti Gatwa is sensational, portraying a charismatic and emotionally healed Doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also just finished watching through <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Netflix-verse of Marvel TV (especially<em> Jessica Jones</em>), so to see some of those characters returning has been wonderful. The series feels like both a reinvention and a continuation of the original three <em>Daredevil </em>seasons, and I&#8217;ve been thrilled by how well it has turned out. The character work, cinematography, and courtroom/political intrigue is all here, and I am stoked for Season 2 &#8211; I just hope some of the Defenders do turn up in Season 2, including not just Jessica Jones, but Luke Cage and Iron Fist too!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a quick rundown on what I&#8217;ve been doing, playing, and watching! I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this quick update &#8211; I think of this site like my own digital journal, so even when I take a break, I always like to come back with some sort of update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really hope you are happy and healthy, and that you are having a wonderful week. See you next time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mikehammer_babyitsmurder_fc.jpg?w=666', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/81tvyzi3mvl._sl1500_.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doctorstrange_dimensionwar_salescover-1.jpg?w=678', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/godzillamovienovelization_omnibus_salescvr_dec24.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}]}

With such an expansive and imaginative open world, it&#8217;s a double-edged sword when it comes to DLC; on one hand, you know people like this world, but on the other, you really have to make the expansion stand out from that world to set it apart. For <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, this is done with a new area named The Cut, full of cold weather, dangerous new machines such as the Scorcher, and intriguing story reveals that bridge the gap between <em>Zero Dawn</em> and the sequel <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/03/30/horizon-forbidden-west-review/">Forbidden West</a></em> (incidentally, the only reason I haven&#8217;t included the <em>Forbidden West</em> DLC on this list is because I don&#8217;t have a PS5 to play it on)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cut is full of activities for main character Aloy, whether it be exploration, narrative, or combat &#8211; including optional super-hard combat trials for the real masochists among us. The local tribe (named the Banuk) tie into the aforementioned overarching story, and as Aloy discovers literal machinations under the snow-covered surface of The Cut, it increased my anticipation around where the sequel will go next &#8211; which is surely a sign of a successful DLC. When I wrote <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/02/14/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds-review/">my review for <em>The Frozen Wilds</em></a> back in 2018, I also noted how it made small steps to improve dialogue animations (which were sometimes quite static in the main game), and you can see how that was continued to full fruition in the dynamic conversations of <em>Forbidden West</em>. Not only is <em>The Frozen Wilds</em> substantial and utterly beautiful to look at, but it actively improves the gameplay foundation of a series I adore.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Mass Effect 3: Leviathan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious choices when it comes to <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC are the fantastic <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> for <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, or the <em>Citadel </em>DLC that served as an epilogue for <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. However, the expansion I have the strongest personal connection to is <em>Leviathan</em>, the first of the <em>Mass Effect 3</em> DLCs. I only bought an Xbox 360 shortly before <em>Mass Effect 3</em> launched, and that game was my gateway into the series (I went back and played the entire trilogy afterwards). After mainly playing on Nintendo consoles beforehand, the concept of single-player expansions was relatively foreign to me &#8211; but after being so enraptured by <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, I was incredibly excited at the prospect of more story content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ending of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is infamous for being disappointing to many people &#8211; but in a way, it made me more excited for DLC that would further flesh out the backstory of the giant world-destroying Reapers that you face throughout the trilogy. <em>Leviathan </em>is all about the discovery of a secret race named (you guessed it) Leviathans, who predate even the mysterious Reapers. In the DLC, you journey across space to piece together morsels of information about their origins. I particularly like the planet 2181 Despoina, a planet covered in water and full of secrets and intense combat situations. That sense of discovering places that were meant to be hidden forever is thrilling, especially when you get to the climactic moments that reveal how the Leviathans play into the wider battle against the Reapers &#8211; and it&#8217;s that rush of energy that makes <em>Leviathan </em>stand out as my favourite <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker &#8211; Special Episode</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very happy when <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> got a Switch release, as it allowed even more people to play this gem of a game &#8211; and I was even happier when in early 2019, a new selection of levels was added with the <em>Special Episode</em> expansion! Whilst this isn&#8217;t a large single-player story expansion like some of the other games I&#8217;ve included in this list, I wanted to highlight this DLC for <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, as it&#8217;s a joyful addition with plenty of value for money (currently £5.39 on Switch). Also, yes, I&#8217;m biased for Captain Toad, but that&#8217;s besides the point, aha&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who haven&#8217;t played <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, it&#8217;s a delightful puzzle game that sees Captain Toad and Toadette make their way through levels based on Hakoniwa Japanese box gardens, with the player rotating and shifting the levels around in order to progress. The <em>Special Episode</em> adds 5 brand new levels and 13 challenges that reinvent previous courses, so 18 new levels to play through in total. As with the main game, there&#8217;s a lovely variety, from haunted caves full of Boos, to a treacherous ship, to another minecart ride! As <em>Treasure Tracker</em> is presented in several book chapters, the DLC additions fit in smoothly, and I&#8217;d frankly happily play as many levels as Nintendo is happy to add (I really hope we get a sequel one day)! The <em>Special Episode</em> is a wonderful and endearing addition to <em>Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Dragon Age: Inquisition &#8211; Trespasser</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a brilliant time with all of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> DLCs, but it&#8217;s the final DLC <em>Trespasser </em>that&#8217;s my favourite of the bunch. Requiring story completion to play, it&#8217;s a definitive end &#8211; and cliffhanger &#8211; to <em>Inquisition</em>, even preventing you from returning to the main game afterwards. The plot brings the player to a summit assembled to decide what happens to the Inquisition now that the main threat has been ended, but soon a new conspiracy is discovered. This eventually reveals that Solas (an eleven mage who&#8217;s a consistent presence in the <em>Dragon Age</em> series) is secretly Fen&#8217;Harel and the Dread Wolf. He&#8217;s been responsible for many of the magical occurrences that have played a part in the game, and he&#8217;s now seeking to collapse the Veil that separates worlds, despite the catastrophic consequences it&#8217;d cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For players who&#8217;ve spent many hours around this character who they thought was on their side, it&#8217;s a dramatic reveal that created a lot of excitement for the sequel to <em>Inquisition</em>. Solas even cuts off the arm of the main character to prevent them stopping him, before disappearing and leaving the player with the decision of whether the Inquisition should be continued or disbanded. <em>Trespasser </em>does have competent combat elements too, but the story is the focus here, and it&#8217;s always been memorable thanks to the anticipation it created for the sequel. However, despite <em>Trespasser </em>releasing in 2015, we only got <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/08/04/dragon-age-the-veilguard-why-im-optimistic-what-id-like-to-see-next/">The Veilguard</a></em> at the end of 2024, so it did leave a lot of time for players to stew and theorize!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Resident Evil 5: Lost in Nightmares/Desperate Escape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I first played <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/02/resident-evil-5-review/">Resident Evil 5</a></em> in 2020, and I did so on PS4, where both the DLC expansions <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> and <em>Desperate Escape</em> are bundled in with the main game, so I&#8217;m going to include them both together for the purposes of this list. Whilst <em>Resident Evil 5</em> certainly has flaws, it also has a lot to praise, such as how it leans into cinematic storytelling. The two DLCs act as a prequel and an in-between-quel, and give an opportunity to play as series mainstay (and <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/23/my-5-favourite-video-game-characters/">my favourite <em>Resident Evil</em> character</a>) Jill Valentine, as well as the pilot Josh Stone. Firstly, <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> is set before <em>Resident Evil 5</em>, and shows Jill and Chris Redfield infiltrating the Spencer estate to confront Albert Wesker. We see snippets of this encounter &#8211; which leaves Jill presumed dead &#8211; during the main game as flashbacks, but here we get to play through it all: puzzles, combat, and Wesker boss fight included. Jill and Chris are the quintessential <em>Resident Evil</em> partners, so it&#8217;s comforting to see them interact (well, as comforting as it can be when facing down monstrosities).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Desperate Escape</em> is set towards the end of the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> campaign, just after Sheva Alomar and Chris manage to free Jill from the mind control of Wesker. Whilst the former pair go after Wesker in the main game, we never got to see how Jill and Josh made their own way out, and we get to play that out for ourselves here. This is arguably the tougher DLC of the two, less puzzle-focused and more about, well, desperately escaping &#8211; ending with a horde-assault sequence that gets frenetic on the higher difficulties. Both DLCs are great for different reasons, and as a combo add a lot to the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> story experience. Jill getting her time to shine is great too, especially as she wasn&#8217;t playable in the main game. This is timeline-wise the last time we got to play as Jill in the main story, too &#8211; please take the hint, Capcom&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The Last of Us: Left Behind</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You knew this had to be on here, right? In my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> rose the bar for story expansions, just like <em>The Last of Us</em> rose the bar for narrative video games. <em>Left Behind</em> fits into the later portions of <em>The Last of Us</em>, after Joel is near-fatally injured, and Ellie is hunting for medical supplies in an abandoned mall. This forms part of Left Behind, but it&#8217;s also interspersed with flashbacks to three weeks before the main game, where Ellie is taken by her friend Riley to break into another abandoned mall in Boston &#8211; and this is where the DLC shines at its brightest. As with many of the other expansions in my list, the core gameplay is a solid continuation of the main game, but it&#8217;s the story advancements and believable character interactions which leave the strongest impact here, giving us brand new information on Elie and her backstory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the best parts of the DLC aren&#8217;t fighting infected, but instead when Riley and Ellie are exploring the desolate mall. They find carousels, video games, and plenty more to play with and talk about. The in-gameplay dialogue that <em>The Last of Us</em> uses so well is continued here, resulting in a moment between the two girls that is both natural and surprising, especially for blockbuster games at the time. It&#8217;s all interwoven with that bittersweet sense that something bad is going to happen &#8211; after all, this is an apocalyptic world, we didn&#8217;t hear much about Riley in the main game, and we know Ellie gets bitten at some point. Those moments do come, but they maintain all their dramatic impact because of the masterful way Naughty Dog combines gameplay and narrative (and also because of brilliant performances by Yaani King as Riley and Ashley Johnson as Ellie). As I said at the start &#8211; in my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> raised the bar for story expansions, and it&#8217;s still one of my favourites to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>With that, we come to the end of the list! As mentioned earlier, there are plenty other great DLC expansions out there, but these are six of my own favourites, each for their own specific reasons.

Therefore, I thought I&#8217;d give a quick overview of what&#8217;s been added to the game and why I&#8217;ve found it so rewarding!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Look to the Skies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s immediately obvious which archetype Konami is pushing with this event &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the Sky Strikers, who were introduced back in 2018 and have become incredibly popular since. The first two <em>Master Duel </em>anniversaries tied into Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so it&#8217;s admittedly a shame we don&#8217;t have a Red-Eyes Black Dragon event to round out the central three <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> Duel Monsters characters of Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey &#8211; but I suppose the power of the fan-favourite Sky Striker characters Raye and Roze was just too strong!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14502" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14515" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14519" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png" width="2560" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop is filled with new items featuring board backgrounds, player mates, card backs, a deck box, and more focused around the Sky Strikers, plus admittedly stunning alternate arts for the main Sky Striker cards. I&#8217;m not an expert on the archetype, but all the amazing artwork and shiny bonuses definitely has me intrigued to learn more about the characters!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of&#8230; The new solo Story is unsurprisingly focused around the Sky Strikers. However, what makes this even more special is the addition of animated sequences within the Sky Striker story, which have been taken from the upcoming anime <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME: THE CHRONICLES</em>. For those who don&#8217;t know, Konami recently announced that this anime will be starting in April 2025, and will be focused on the actual card lore itself. So, instead of revolving around duels (like <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em>, <em>5D&#8217;s</em>, or <em>Arc-V</em> did, for example), <em>CHRONICLES </em>will be set within the world of the cards, which is very exciting! It&#8217;s been announced that these episodes will include the archetypes Fall of Albaz, Dogmatika Ecclesia, and yes &#8211; Sky Strikers!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14505" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14507" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14508" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing small clips of the anime in the <em>Master Duel</em> solo mode was unexpected, and acts as a lovely tease of what&#8217;s to come. The animation is vibrant and expressive, and it&#8217;s great to see this willingness to expand on the card lore &#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely be checking these anime episodes out as they release. Also I have to mention that the new UI for the solo mode is much improved and more player-friendly, segmenting the various solo stories up in a cleaner way, which I appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Festival Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next major addition to <em>Master Duel</em> is the two Festivals that are happening this month &#8211; the first one, Legend Anthology, features a custom banlist that excludes common staples, such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. In theory, this shakes up the meta within the mode, especially with three pre-made decks ready for players to use. However, this mode is dominated by the new Exodia deck and cards, in particular The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate, which can reach upwards of 10000 ATK and can also negates card effects. Often, the match is decided on the coin flip, as if a player goes first and gets out this Exodia card, it&#8217;s extremely hard to the opponent to stage a comeback. Still, the mode has plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, so it&#8217;s worth grinding through.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14511" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14510" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14509" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m much more excited for the upcoming Fusion X Synchro Festival (starting 17th February), which will restrict the Extra Deck to only Synchro/Fusion monsters, and cut out all the options that Link and XYZ monsters have added. I&#8217;m growing to respect those newer card types more over time, but it&#8217;ll still be fun to play some games that make players revert to pre-XYZ strategies. Hopefully it&#8217;ll allow some of my older classic decks to be a bit more viable (at least briefly)! Just like the Legend Anthology, there are plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, which should make it worth the playtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Plenty of Prizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that has always pleasantly surprised me about <em>Master Duel</em> is how generous it is as a Free-to-Play game. The 3rd Anniversary is timed with the start of a new Duel Pass, which is a 700-Gem purchase that &#8211; if you complete it &#8211; earns you all your Gems back, as well as cosmetic and in-game currency rewards, such as a background themed around the aforementioned Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate. If I had to suggest improvements, it would be for a few more unique cosmetic rewards in the Pass &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to complain too much about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the Sky Striker items I mentioned earlier, the shop also has a new Structure Deck full of the expensive HERO cards, new Selection Packs that include those new Exodia cards, as well as another chance to buy previous Anniversary-exclusive items themed around Blue-Eyes White Dragon. As someone who took a long break from <em>Master Duel</em>, I appreciate this a lot, and am slowly working my way through acquiring these.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14517" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14512" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14514" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The deck that&#8217;s currently giving me the most success is my anti-meta Gravekeeper deck, which I&#8217;ve fine-tuned to include more drawing cards and be more reliable (see the decklist image above). I&#8217;ve also finally put together my Destiny HERO deck, which is more meta, and features more Extra Deck combo cards. For long-term success in <em>Master Duel</em>, I need to learn more of these combo plays (and how to combat other combo decks), so I don&#8217;t want to stick with anti-meta decks like Gravekeepers for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my quick summation of the new <em>Master Duel</em> features and how they&#8217;ve positively affected the game &#8211; I&#8217;m really enjoying the amount to do right now, as well as the continued support Konami is bringing. I&#8217;m still slowly re-acclimatising myself to <em>Master Duel</em> after such a long time away, but I&#8217;m continuing to enjoy it and play a few duels every day. If anyone else is intrigued in giving the game a shot, I&#8217;d say now is an ideal time to jump on board, as the game is offering many player-friendly rewards that not only play on nostalgia for <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, but also relate to future projects like the <em>CHRONICLES </em>anime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this quick article &#8211; and if you&#8217;re playing <em>Master Duel</em>, let me know how you&#8217;re finding it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}]}

The map is cast in darkness and takes place around the crumbling facade of an old castle. The outer area is full of fountains and gardens. A web of caves snakes underneath, delivering players to different points of interest.

A new zone, a new raid, new procedural dungeons, increased gear score, new perk customization for gear, new set bonuses for items, the return of a gear-upgrading system, and even more changes than I can list right now. It is a massive update and has me excited!<p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;It is no mystery that <em>New World</em> is my favorite MMO and that my main complaint has been a lack of fresh content to enjoy and goals to work toward. This update brings a massive influx of not only new content but also changes that reset the starting line on goals. It\'s awesome to see us getting both content and rewards progression in the same update!</p>\n<p>Let\'s dive into some of the updates:</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>There is a new zone,&nbsp;</span>Nighthaven, and a level increase from 65 to 70. The zone will be werewolf- and vampire-inspired, which fits very well with much of the Lost aesthetic already in the game. The "vampire hunter" look has been a notable fashion possibility since <em>New World</em> launched. There is mention of werewolf creatures, which should mean new enemy types to fight (I honestly can\'t remember the last time we got a new enemy type).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The storyline that ended in the Elysian Wilds will continue with a new arc in the new zone, and I am assuming this will carry players to level 70. It is good to have new levels to go with the content, but I hope there is a bit more investment required than what level 60–65 offered. Many players leveled to 65 in just a matter of hours after the release of <em>Rise of the Angry Earth</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;A new game mode is also being introduced: <strong>Catacombs.</strong> This is the procedurally generated dungeon experience that was hinted at previously. Catacombs will challenge groups of up to 3 players with procedurally generated expeditions that continue to ratchet up the challenge level the longer players survive. The farther players make it, the greater the reward. I like that it will be 3 players and not require full 5-player groups. Three has always felt like a sweet spot for the game. I also like that, in order to get the rewards, one of the group members must exit successfully, which should lead to fun decisions on when to give up and escape—and who will make the run for it. As a tank, I suspect it won’t be me jetting for the exit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;A new raid, <strong>Isle of Night,</strong> is being added. This will be good for those players that enjoy raids. Personally, I’ve never done the first 10-man raid, Hive of Gorgons, so I’m not sure if I’ll jump in here. It’s not ruled out, as I have access to organized groups that run content, but raids just aren’t usually how I like to spend my in-game time. Though, as we’ll see with the progression updates, I may need to make some time for this raid.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Which brings us to a ton of progression changes for the endgame. Gear score is increasing to a max of 800 (up from the current 725). Along with that comes the concept of set bonuses for certain gear obtained from endgame content like raids. Mix and match the set bonuses to get even stronger results from your gear. Additionally, perk charms and gear will let us change out not only the gem slot but also the other perk slots. Many of those charms will be crafted, keeping crafters relevant. A new perk type, <strong>infix,</strong> will also be available, similar to what makes current artifacts unique with their perks. Oh, and perks have gone through a hefty overhaul, so expect an entirely new approach to builds in the game!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;If that wasn’t enough, they are also adding back a version of the umbral system where gear can be upgraded from 700 GS to 800 GS. Multiple changes were made to (hopefully) make the system better. The currency is now in a wallet instead of an inventory item, with a limit of 1,000 so they can’t be hoarded as in the previous system. This should encourage players to spend them! I know I was guilty as sin of not spending my hoard of umbrals in the last version. The rate at which they can be earned will be time-gated, which is disappointing but an understandable design decision to slow progression and even it out among the player base.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Tucked away in the notes about progression and gear is that they are doing away with attributes on gear. All attribute points will now be granted as players level up to max level. Gone are the days of getting an amazing armor piece for your greatsword build only for it to have a +FOC attribute bonus making it worthless. This will also allow them to tie attributes to the gear set feature, so now when changing gear sets it will also change your attributes. Nice!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Also included is another new <strong>Outpost Rush</strong> map called <em>The Tower.</em> It was literally years from launch until we recently got the Coral Divide map, and now we are getting yet another! It’s almost like Amazon Games is listening to all the player demand for more maps for one of its best game modes! The map will be available during a preview weekend event later in September.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The best part of all of this? It’s a free seasonal update. <em>New World</em> continues to deliver amazing value with some of the friendliest monetization in the entire MMO genre. Buy the box, play, and get great updates like <em>Nighthaven</em> for free!</p><p><i>Note: this post was edited with the help of AI (ChatGPT).

It is an object model for UI objects.</p>\n<p>Being an object model for UI objects implies that if something is not represented by UI objects, then UI Automation has no obligation to represent it.</p>\n<p>The postal service is not required to maintain records for buildings that do not exist. Now, it might, for its own internal reasons, choose to keep records for buildings that recently existed, or records for buildings that are planned to exist soon, but its obligation is to deliver mail to buildings that exist <i>right now</i>.</p>\n<p>In order to make something visible to UI Automation, you have to make it appear in the UI, and for overflow notification icons, that means opening the overflow flyout so that the icons become visible.</p>\n<p>Similarly, there is no way to use UI Automation to enumerate the hidden notification icons. If the icon is hidden, then there is no UI for it, which means that there is nothing for UI Automation to operate on.</p>\n<p>Some programs provide object models for their content. For example, Office apps have a rich document object model that allows you to manipulate documents like Excel spreadsheets via script. Whether any particular program offers such an object model is a case-by-case question.</p>\n<p>In the case of the taskbar, there is no supported object model for notification icons. UI Automation is the best you can do.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20250929-00/?p=111637">How can I enumerate the overflow icons in the Notification Area without showing them?</a> appeared first on <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing">The Old New Thing</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20250929-00/?p=111637/feed', 'slash_comments': '1'}

The first part was an MS-DOS program, which was used if you installed Windows 95 from MS-DOS. It installed a miniature version of Windows 3.1 and then used it for the next part. The second part was a 16-bit Windows program, which was the starting point if you installed Windows 95 from Windows 3.1 or Windows 95. This second part did most of the work. The third part was a 32-bit Windows program, which ran inside the inewly-installed Windows 95 to carry out some final steps that must be done inside the installed operating system.</p>\n<p>Some people wondered if the MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 versions could install a miniature Windows 95 rather than a miniature Windows 3.1. That would allow the bulk of the work to be done in a fully 32-bit operating system and take advantage of new Windows 95 features.</p>\n<p>I guess you could do that, but there are problems with that design, both from an engineering and a user experience standpoint.</p>\n<p>From the engineering side, it would mean having to develop a miniature version of Windows 95 in the first place. Using the miniature Windows 3.1 didn&#8217;t incur any extra engineering cost because there was already a fully-debugged miniature Windows 3.1 that could be pulled off the shelf and pressed into service. The Windows 95 project was notoriously behind schedule, and adding a &#8220;Develop a variant of Windows 95 for the sole purpose of running Setup&#8221; would be a large work item that would instantly get <a href="https://businessjargon.com/dictionary-p-words/#:~:text=Pushback"> pushback</a>. &#8220;Can you find a quicker and less expensive way of doing this?&#8221; Especially since Windows 95 itself was still under development, so you would be chasing a moving target. Everybody working on a new feature would have to remember, &#8220;Oh wait, but what if we&#8217;re running in miniature mode?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even if you decide that creating a miniature version of Windows 95 is feasible within the desired timeframe, there is the user experience issue: That miniature version of Windows 95 is probably not going to fit on a single floppy disk. It appears that somebody managed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030803064537/http://www.wimborne.org/richard/shrinkingwindows/"> strip it down to around 7.5 MB</a>, with a remark that 5 MB &#8220;might&#8221; be possible.</p>\n<p>Now, the <tt>MINI.CAB</tt> that comes on the Windows 95 Setup Disk 1 is 441,905 bytes in size, and it expands out to 815,307 bytes, a compressed size of 54.2%. Let&#8217;s be nice and call it 50%.</p>\n<p>This means that a miniature install of Windows 95 might fit into 2.5 MB, which is two floppies. That&#8217;s not so bad.</p>\n<p>So now we have this:</p>\n<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>MS-DOS<br />\nuser</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Windows 3.x<br />\nuser</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>↓</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>↓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MS-DOS<br />\nfile copy</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Windows 3.x<br />\nfile copy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align="right"><img alt="↘" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2198.png" style="height: 1em;" /></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td align="left"><img alt="↙" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2199.png" style="height: 1em;" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Reboot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>↓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Main setup</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td style="text-align: left;">← Windows 95 user</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>↓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Reboot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>↓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Final setup</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>One catch is that we have to write two versions of the code that copies the miniature Windows 95 to the system, depending on the starting point. That is a little bit of code duplication, and it&#8217;s a little more complex than the file copying code that Windows 95 actually uses for copying the miniature Windows 3.1 since there is a floppy swap involved.</p>\n<p>Another catch is the need for a reboot into the miniature Windows 95, since the Windows 95 file system takes over operations from the MS-DOS file system that booted the system. In order to do that, they need to agree on the internal MS-DOS data structures the track the open files, and the MS-DOS side needs to provide the necessary hooks for the Windows 95 virtual machine manager to take over from it.</p>\n<p>After the main setup is done, we do another reboot, this time into the real copy of Windows 95 (not the temporary one), and let the final setup delete the temporary copy and finish setting up the real copy.</p>\n<p>Now, this design does impair the user experience.</p>\n<p>The preferred workflow would be to get the user quickly to the point where they are answering questions about how they want Windows to be installed, and then go off and do the work and then finish in Windows 95 with a single reboot.</p>\n<p>With this alternate design, the MS-DOS and Windows 3.x cases now do a lot more work before the user can start answering questions. This is frustrating because it means that the user can&#8217;t just start Setup, answer some questions, and then walk away and get some coffee. They have to babysit the Setup past the initial file copy (that includes a floppy swap) and sit through a reboot, wait for BIOS to POST, then wait for the miniature Windows 95 to boot itself up and get to the point where it can ask questions.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we now have two reboots, which breaks the &#8220;only one reboot&#8221; principle.</p>\n<p>The staged version where the MS-DOS Setup program quickly installs and runs a miniature version of Windows 3.1 lets us get the user into the &#8220;asking questions&#8221; stage faster, and it also avoids the double-reboot.</p>\n<p>¹ Another suggestion I saw was to install Windows 3.1 with Win32s so that the main setup program could be written as a 32-bit program. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with this proposal. One is that <a href="https://web.mit.edu/cascon/microsoft/win32sins.htm" title="How to download and install Win32s using Windows 3.1 File Manager"> Win32s itself requires a reboot after installing</a>, so you haven&#8217;t solved the double-reboot problem. Also, Win32s is itself 2 MB in size, so that adds to the amount of stuff the user has to wait for before they can start answering questions. And this extra 2 MB is used only by Setup; it isn&#8217;t going to be reused by the real Windows 95, so this adds to the number of floppies that need to be used.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Win32s requires Enhanced Mode Windows 3.1, so the miniature Windows 3.1 isn&#8217;t good enough, since that is just Standard Mode Windows. You now need to include a miniature Enhanced Mode Windows 3.1, but nobody has made one of those yet. The ready-made miniature Windows 3.1 is Standard Mode, not Enhanced Mode. And the Enhanced Mode Windows 3.1 will probably be a few more megabytes, adding to the amount of &#8220;dead weight&#8221; on the Windows 95 installation floppies.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20250926-00/?p=111629">Why didn&#8217;t Windows 95 setup install a miniature Windows 95 so that it could be written as a 32-bit program?</a> appeared first on <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing">The Old New Thing</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20250926-00/?p=111629/feed', 'slash_comments': '8'}

Which, to be fair, is primarily due to the FOMO elements. The introduction of the new Legendary gloves you can get for running Quickplay versions of the early Fractals will be sticking around, but there&#8217;s another &#8220;reward track&#8221; that grants two Bag space slots, a 20-slot bag, and a Legendary starter kit that will be going away on October 7th. Theoretically, you can still grind most/all of it by the time this post goes Live, but I have enjoyed gaining some extra progress &#8211; via Daily/Weekly achievement resets &#8211; by spacing things out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is probably some debate to be had as to whether adding the Quickplay feature to Fractals will lead to more players doing Fractals after the event ends. Honestly&#8230; maybe? It certainly has demystified the game mode to an extent, as my normal M.O. for this sort of group content would be to watch YouTube videos to understand all the mechanics before even stepping inside. That sort of thing is not particularly viable when Quickplay has like 10ish options randomly picked for you. Of course, everything has been toned way down for the game mode, so you get the gist after seeing the maps several times even if you aren&#8217;t reading text (since everyone is Go-Go-Go). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gw2_wizardvault.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17806" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gw2_wizardvault.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A little agency goes a long way</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another piece of &#8220;content&#8221; I have very much enjoyed is the Wizard&#8217;s Vault. This is a rework of the Daily Achievements (read: daily quests) system with a fancy new interface and currency called Astral Acclaim. It was very annoying at first, as it had a mixture of PvE and PvP objectives, but once I figured out that you can uncheck the PvP box and get all PvE-based objectives, everything was grand. You have both Daily and Weekly tabs you can work on, and then you have a large menu of rewards to choose from that eventually reset every quarter or whatever. So, for example, you can choose to spend Astral Acclaim on certain cosmetics, or a Legendary starter kit, or a bag containing 1g (x90), or your choice of an Ascended Weapon, and so on. The Weekly tab requires six objectives to get the big bonus chest, but there are eight total options so you even have some choice to skip ones you find annoying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing I haven&#8217;t done is purchase any expansion content. For one thing, Visions of Eternity is right around the corner (Oct 28). While $25 is not onerous for an MMO expansion, purchasing three of them back-to-back is another matter. Plus, you know how I am: why pay full price when the expansions were literally on sale at the beginning of the month? I missed that boat, but I&#8217;m assuming there will be another sale around launch day. Of course, waiting is always kind of risky, as I could easily come to my senses and start playing other things again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Fake Edit]</strong> Steam Autumn sale is on, and now those two expansions are $17.50 and $19.99. Huzzah!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing I haven&#8217;t (yet) started in on are unlocking Legendaries. In pretty much every guide out there, the recommendation is for players to <em>not</em> do weapon or armor Legendaries first, but instead go for accessories (rings, amulet, etc). This makes some sense, as accessories apply to every character you ever make, whereas armor is broken up into weight classes (can&#8217;t use Light Armor Legendary on your Thief). Weapon Legendaries can apply to multiple characters&#8230; but not if they are off-meta or off-spec. Well, this is GW2, so meta probably doesn&#8217;t <em>really</em> matter all that much.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gw2_birthday.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17808" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gw2_birthday.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">My original character celebrating 12 years&#8230; camping a daily Jumping Puzzle chest, as god intended</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the &#8220;problem&#8221; is that I have effectively decked out all my alts in Ascended accessories already. It&#8217;s been like seven years <a href="https://inanage.com/2018/02/20/finding-the-zone/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">since this post</a>, but farming Winterberries an unholy amount of times will get you most everything you need. Berserker stats won&#8217;t help Viper builds, but as long as you alternate what you get your alts, you can usually just shuffle the accessories around each time balance patches change the math. Grinding out Vision or Aurora or whatever may provide a little QoL bump, but it will not actually improve any stats. So, dilemma. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, I will continue what I&#8217;m doing for as long as it remains fun. Which it is. For now. Although, I came across <a href="https://inanage.com/2021/12/13/priorities/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">this &#8220;resolution&#8221;</a> while looking up past GW2 posts, and&#8230; yeah.

What broke me out of the cycle was the then-pending release of Secrets of the Obscure expansion. Even though GW2 is one of the few MMOs out there that doesn&#8217;t obsolete content once expansions come out, just knowing that everyone <em>else</em> would be doing all the cool stuff while you&#8217;re stuck gathering Flax or whatever sucks. On the other hand, I didn&#8217;t necessary want to pay $30 for more GW2, so I took that as a sign to uninstall and do something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I did. Another expansion came out called Janthir Wilds, and I let that one pass me by too. It even featured the ability to have a decorative house, introduced a spear weapon for every class, and so on. Neat. Have fun with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is even yet another expansion coming out in October called Visions of Eternity. I think there are even new Elite specs this time around. Haven&#8217;t really looked into too far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why am I writing about GW2, and in fact have reinstalled the game? <strong>They finally introduced LFD</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s technically a beta feature, but it&#8217;s called Quickplay, and it&#8217;s the same automated group finder feature from WoW circa 16 years ago. Press button, get an instant 5-man squad and teleport right next to them. Right now, it is pointing towards even-easier versions of T1 Fractals, but presumably it will be expanded in the future to actual dungeons, perhaps Strikes, maybe raids? Moreover, ArenaNet has erected an extremely generous set of Achievements surrounding spam-queueing T1 Fractals for the next several weeks, resulting in extra bag slots, a Legendary glove (!!), and other such goodies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As dumb as it sounds, yeah, reading about Quickplay (and the rewards, obviously) is what pushed me over the edge into downloading GW2 again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;sorta. Honestly, I had also reached a point where I realized that I was logging into No Man&#8217;s Sky just because I couldn&#8217;t think of a better game to play for those &#8220;don&#8217;t want to commit to 1+ hour game sessions&#8221; moments. If I&#8217;m not committing to something, why not <em>not</em> commit to something that <em>could</em> possibly be relevant in the future? Then again, Guild Wars 3 is going to be a thing at some point, rendering everything moot. Also, heat death of the universe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, bottom line, I&#8217;ve been playing GW2 a lot the past few days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://inanage.com/2025/09/22/gw2-too/feed/', 'slash_comments': '3', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e7719ed015b5aabeef04fa3af9dbfccc005de2a8d664feacf23a3883cacb8364?s=96&d=&r=R', 'medium': 'image'}]}

We&#8217;ve seen a lot of feedback about the strong neutral package of Fyrakk, Elise, Naralex, and Ysera, and we&#8217;ll be keeping a close eye on them moving forward. We&#8217;ve also continued to hear suggestions to buff nearly every new Quest so they become competitive archetypes. However, as we&#8217;ve shared before, too many competitive Quests in the long term can lead to a metagame that isn&#8217;t fun or healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More broadly, we believe future expansions are a better place to bring community feedback to life than trying to overhaul the current set through balance patches. We fell short of our goal of introducing enough new competitive options this expansion. As we look ahead to the next expansion and beyond, we&#8217;re keeping your response to this set in mind and are using it to help shape the future of Hearthstone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you are unaware, the Hearthstone devs <strong>chose to bring Quest cards back</strong>. As in, they created 11 <em>Legendary cards</em>, put them into digital packs, and then sold them in FOMO $50/$80 bundles. Now, I understand the notion of &#8220;pack filler&#8221; and such in CCGs&#8230; but it still boggles my mind that they reintroduced an entire archetype (presumably for nostalgia reasons) despite wanting it to be non-competitive from the start. This is on top of the overall &#8220;toning down&#8221; of the power level of the last few sets, leading to goddamn <em>Wisp</em> being a core card in the current meta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people express concern about power creep, e.g. the tendency of devs to make new stuff stronger than existing stuff. While that is a problem, it&#8217;s more of a conceptual one rather than real. This is because, fundamentally, both the devs and players want the same thing: to play with new cards. If the new sets are weak, players get stuck playing with the old cards. Nevermind all the people who got scammed spending real money buying the new cards the devs intentionally designed to be bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m over here struggling to come up with equivalent comparisons capable of highlighting exactly how dumb the situation is. An MMO expansion featuring worse gear than what players already had? Or maybe a new talent tree that is worse at healing/tanking/DPS than what existed before? I could still imagine some people wanting such an expansion simply for the story and new playstyle, so it does not quite fit the situation with Hearthstone. Competition against other players is the only thing you got in terms of content. So, even if you wanted to experience new deck archetypes, the result is that you will just lose. Badly. Some of these new decks had winrates in the 20-30% range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really have to hand it to Blizzard though. What other company can fail this spectacularly, so many times in a row, and still have the audacity to put out $158 cosmetics? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s really just us players that are dumb.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://inanage.com/2025/09/18/designed-to-fail/feed/', 'slash_comments': '4', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e7719ed015b5aabeef04fa3af9dbfccc005de2a8d664feacf23a3883cacb8364?s=96&d=&r=R', 'medium': 'image'}]}

In any case, I decided I need to give things another go after 5 (five!) years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I encountered was <em>still</em> one of the worst opening sequences for almost any game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I apparently have never commented on it before, but NMS starts with you awakening on an alien planet, your suit powering up, and then a number of warnings about your environmental protection waning. Conceptually, this is fine; other survival games start you out in imminent danger too. For example, ARK has you awakening on a beach and sometimes being eaten by a raptor right away. In NMS&#8217;s case though, it just feels&#8230; bad. Your visor scanner doesn&#8217;t work, sometimes you don&#8217;t spawn near required resources to refill your environmental protection, and you don&#8217;t have the terrain modification gun yet which otherwise trivializes most hostile weather (e.g. dig a tunnel and get underground).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_field.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17731" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_field.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Can still be a very beautiful game, of course</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Worse, I actually tried starting things back up by immediately choosing an Expedition. Big mistake. Expeditions were added to the game several patches ago, and they are basically more focused experiences where you start out on predefined planets and need to accomplish specific goals. The problem is that these are absolutely tuned more for advanced players with a good grasp of the underlying mechanics. Well, and the <em>other</em> problem is that everyone is thrown into the same subsets of planets, so you might spawn in an area where everyone has mined most of the nearby ore. More annoyingly to me though, is that when you are looking around for resources, you&#8217;re bombarded with dozens of (useless) player base icons, making finding things difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, don&#8217;t do what I did. Instead, get a foothold in the game and <em>then</em> go into an Expedition &#8211; including bringing some good loot in with you! &#8211; via a vendor you unlock a few hours in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, since I hate myself, I chose to start a brand new save on Survival difficulty. C&#8217;mon, I had 130+ hours logged already, right? Beginning is brutal, as mentioned, and you have to contend with some extra nonsense like smaller stack sizes for material, etc. Within about 15 hours though, I&#8217;m back to having 22 million units, 6000 nanites, and unlocking all 10 freighter storage racks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_space2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17732" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_space2.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Space: the only frontier with gameplay</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No Man&#8217;s Sky has indeed improved tremendously over the years, but fundamentally it <em>does</em> still have a problem with &#8220;but&#8230; why?&#8221; It&#8217;s the same place <a href="https://inanage.com/2020/10/15/still-no-mans-sky/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">I landed on five years ago</a>, and unfortunately it does not appear much has changed. Well, OK, there have been a lot of changes. Expeditions, there are now Dissonant planets with corrupted Sentinels, there is a Settlement system, Pirate Dreadnaughts to fight/own, the new bespoke Corvette-class ship building system, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fundamentally, though? When you&#8217;re on foot, none of the randomly-generated creatures matter; only Sentinels pose any threat whatsoever, and there are only like a half-dozen types. Why even have so many different kinds of weapons for your multi-tool if only one is needed to take down every enemy? Meanwhile, if you spend more than 30 seconds in space, you&#8217;re likely to be accosted by fleets of hostile pirates that will absolutely murder you if given half a chance. The space gameplay &#8220;loop&#8221; is not particularly deep, but nevertheless feels miles more complete than what you are doing in the other 80% of the game, e.g. walking on planets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said all that&#8230; yeah, 130+ hours plus however many I muster this time around. I&#8217;m harsh on the game because I&#8217;m mad. Hello Games have added so much and just inexplicably left such a gaping hole in the center and I don&#8217;t understand <em>why</em>. Maybe having Gek pirates running around on foot blasting you would feel too weird or whatever, but apparently it&#8217;s fine when they&#8217;re faceless ships? OK, just use some of the six trillion randomized alien creatures and make some of them require that fancy mech to fight! Or lean more into those bug aliens that are apparently as ubiquitous as the Sentinels for (presumably) some kind of lore reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, I guess, ignore all that and hurry up and give me <a href="https://inanage.com/2023/12/12/light-some-fires/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Light No Fire</a>. </p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://inanage.com/2025/09/11/old-mans-sky/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e7719ed015b5aabeef04fa3af9dbfccc005de2a8d664feacf23a3883cacb8364?s=96&d=&r=R', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_2020.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_field.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_space2.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Packing it in my carry-on instead of a checked bag probably helped. Everything else was in a travel case that held up beautifully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not to belabor the point much, but the Switch was very portable; I doubt anyone is packing a PS5 into a carry-on or whatever for a one-week trip.

If there was an appropriate use case, this was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the games we played, we exclusively used the&#8230; half controller (?) configuration. Pretty awkward controller for me, but it was OK for the types of games we were playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mario Kart 8</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Started out with Mario Kart to try and leave a good impression with a game that had a lot of replay value. Kid was ready to give it up after a couple circuits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Near as I can tell, there are two degrees of Assist Mode when it comes to Mario Kart 8. The first appears to be a generalized &#8220;automatically stay on the track.&#8221; You can still fly off if struck by something while airborne, but I believe the game otherwise keeps you from getting turned around or going out of bounds. The second level of assist is acceleration. For sure, I had this turned off for myself, even though I&#8217;m not certain <em>how</em>. My son, meanwhile, was otherwise able to leisurely putter around with only minor course (mis)corrections when the mood struck him. I had heard from a friend that Assist Mode is sometimes able to win races all by itself, but I did not at all see that in the 50cc difficulty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My own impressions of the game &#8220;for real&#8221; will have to wait for a later opportunity. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Super Mario Bros Wonder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the first real hit with the child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way two-player works is its own sort of Assist Mode. One player has the &#8220;crown&#8221; and the camera follows them, pushing the other(s) along if they go off-screen. If someone falls down a pit or hits an enemy, they return as a floating ghost with a 5-second timer. Connect with an alive player in time and they will respawn with no loss of lives. Additionally, if someone is controlling Yoshi or a rabbit-looking dude, they become immune to dying by enemies&#8230; but cannot transform with power-ups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, what I have come to realize is that platformers are, you know, kinda hard for kids. Somehow we all made it through back in the day, sure, but <em>god damn</em>. Hate to even think about what our parents had to go through listening to us die in the original Mario Bros. Maybe that&#8217;s why they beat us with belts and/or shut us outside until after dark?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Super Mario Bros Odyssey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Odyssey is what we played after Wonder, and is the clear favorite currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Assist Mode for Odyssey is that there are blue arrows showing where the player should go next, and I <em>think</em> that the penalty for falling into a pit is more relaxed (just 1 less heart vs&#8230; something else). Additionally, the second player gets to control the hat, which can be pretty cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the platforming is not especially designed for a 6-year old here either, so there are some sequences when he wanted me to take over. Even being the hat was tricky, as you have to contend with having your perspective change if Mario moves around. Plus, sometimes you have to use the hat <em>right now</em> to prevent damage or make the boss vulnerable, or whatever. It&#8217;s a big responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re getting pretty close to &#8220;Bowser Wowser&#8221; as he&#8217;s been christened though, and my guy is having more fun watching than playing sometimes. We&#8217;ll see how things shake out in a couple weeks/months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Super Smash Bros Ultimate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Didn&#8217;t actually get around to this one, despite my asking him several times if he wanted to try a different game. My guess is that he could still have fun on a team with daddy against whatever the equivalent of a bunch of Level 1 CPU Jigglypuffs there are in this one. Probably still Jigglypuffs. </p>'}], 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e7719ed015b5aabeef04fa3af9dbfccc005de2a8d664feacf23a3883cacb8364?s=96&d=&r=R', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_juice.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17684" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_juice.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In spite of the low-res graphics, some places can surprise you.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are link-averse, Abiotic Factor is essentially a closed-world survival-crafting game set in a SCP meets Half-Life-like setting with a similar plot. I mentioned &#8220;closed-world&#8221; instead of &#8220;linear&#8221; earlier because while the game does have an generally predefined path &#8211; as opposed to something like ARK &#8211; you get to unlock doors and open up shortcuts that will make backtracking more convenient. And there is indeed some backtracking required to collect additional resources to fuel your science machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have found that the way resources are handled is&#8230; mostly acceptable. Just about everything in the facility can be stripped down for parts, but once they are gone, they are gone. In the meantime, you will find portals to various &#8220;anteverses&#8221; that you need to explore and complete. These portals are similar to the general facility in that they are more linear but you can unlock shortcuts for subsequent visits. Emphasis on subsequent visits. Twice every in-game week all portals reset themselves, including any items therein. To an extent, this does lend itself towards a sort of resource speed-run that gets tiresome after a while, especially when you&#8217;re looking for just one particular thing (Staplers, Glue, etc).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand: what other survival-crafting game doesn&#8217;t require farming some resources?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_angryrobot.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17685" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_angryrobot.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Truly in the &#8220;find out&#8221; part of this encounter</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One element I have been surprised about is how well the devs maintained a sense of positive progression. In the beginning, the night is indeed dark and full of terrors &#8211; electricity is shut off, hostile security bots patrol, and you&#8217;re mostly sitting in the corner somewhere praying the noises of unknown source will just stop. After a while, you learn how to craft batteries and traps and makeshift barriers, creating a safe(r) space for yourself. Exploring further afield leads to longer return trips, which sucks. Then you make a cart, where you can stack your loot and push it back to base. Or you unlock a particularly helpful shortcut cutting down on the commute. You start creating forward bases instead of bringing everything with you. Finally, slightly past the mid-game&#8230; absolute bliss. Let&#8217;s just say you still need to explore new areas, but returning somewhere is no longer a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, the general lethality of the game remains high even on Normal difficulty. You can be well armed and provisioned, but some enemies will still be able to take you out in short order. In the endgame where I am, some of the enemies have become a bit bullet-spongy too, but I&#8217;m not <em>too</em> mad about it because the difficulty of each encounter is largely in your hands. Having trouble clearing a room? How about setting up a bunch of turrets in the doorway and let them duke it out instead of you? There are power sockets in a bunch of places in the facility, and even if there aren&#8217;t, you can always bring your own fully-charged batteries. While not quite on the level of Prey, Abiotic Factor does give you a similar level of freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_mist.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17687" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_mist.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Yeah, maybe just keep sneakin&#8217;</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the negative side, the game is not afraid of sometimes setting you up against (mostly) invulnerable enemies. Usually these act more as mobile traps/hazards, but a not insignificant portion of the game is spent being stalked by the equivalent of a Boo from Mario. It&#8217;s spooky and provides plenty of dynamic jump scare opportunities at first&#8230; and then the game keeps going for another 20 hours before you get something that can grant you peace. But surprise! There&#8217;s another at the endgame. Sigh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another downside comes from some lingering rough edges from Early Access. The devs have been very quick with hotfixes to patch various bugs, which is great. But there are some things that need some more love, or semblance of purpose. For example, there are several dozen cooking recipes with complex/rare ingredients that barely provide more sustenance than basic ones. Some weapons serve no discernable purpose, being weaker than what you had access to before. There are several endgame Sharp weapons, but no Blunt ones. Speaking of which, the late game annoyingly introduces you to new weapons and then immediately enemies that are resistant to their damage. Like&#8230; why?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_shotgun.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17688" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_shotgun.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Used this baby for quite some time</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all fixable problems though, and the devs seem like reasonable people thus far. I&#8217;m excited to hear what they have in store for v1.1 and beyond. Mostly. Because at the end of the day, I am very clearly nearing the end of the game. Clocking more than 130 hours is certainly sufficient for my money&#8217;s worth, but I&#8217;m nevertheless sad that starting over is unlikely to generate the same novel experience. This is where a more traditional, rogue-like survival game (e.g. 7 Days to Die, Minecraft, etc) might pull ahead in the long-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said all that, well&#8230; one hundred and thirty goddamn hours. Abiotic Factor is legit. It&#8217;s one of the most novel survival-crafting experiences I have had since Subnautica, and reminded me why I love the genre so much. Play now or play later, but I recommend playing it. Also, it&#8217;s on Game Pass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e7719ed015b5aabeef04fa3af9dbfccc005de2a8d664feacf23a3883cacb8364?s=96&d=&r=R', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_juice.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_angryrobot.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_mist.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_shotgun.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}]}

And actually, all those percentages are kind of weird. Is character customization not also exclusive content? Are content packs not battle passes? Who knows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the through line is clear: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>According to the findings, the West games market is seeing slowing &#8220;payer growth,&#8221; with a 1.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in North America and 3.1% CAGR in Europe between 2023 and 2027. As such, Newzoo and Tebex recommend studios &#8220;shift from acquiring new players to maximizing value from existing ones.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a tangled web of chicken vs egg speculation about why player growth has slowed. Market saturation? Higher prices and too much &#8220;maximizing value&#8221; squeezing people out? Shaky economic future? The rise of lifestyle/live-service/forever games like Fortnite, Roblox, etc? (Time) Competition from short-form video content?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funnily enough, most of these points were covered back in January in <a href="https://inanage.com/2025/01/20/the-hopes-of-the-game-industry/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the Hopes of the Game Industry</a>. And the answer is&#8230; Yes. All of those things, simultaneously. There have been tremendous layoffs in the games industry this year, including high-profile sequels and nearly-complete games thrown in the trash. We mourn the loss of what could have been, but the suits see how only ~12% of gaming hours are spent playing new games. Why risk $100m+ and eight years building a game when you can &#8220;maximize value&#8221; out of established ones? And if you don&#8217;t have any of those games, just buy&#8217;em up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, it could be an interesting debate about which happened first. Did escalating prices for new games send players back into the arms of familiar classics? Or did the introduction of microtransactions start making games stickier, as a means of assuaging sunk costs? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>True answers, if any exist, are academic at this point. Developers are following the money and it&#8217;s hard to blame them. Well, aside from being increasingly incapable of making fun games even after 4-8 years and tens millions of dollars and are now choosing to erode your <a href="https://inanage.com/2011/07/26/the-problem-with-f2p-and-microtransactions/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">consumer surplus</a> instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can certainly blame them for that.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://inanage.com/2025/08/14/following-the-money/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e7719ed015b5aabeef04fa3af9dbfccc005de2a8d664feacf23a3883cacb8364?s=96&d=&r=R', 'medium': 'image'}]}

That blog gets dropped. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s really only two reasons to have excerpts on: you don&#8217;t know better, or you do. In the latter case, congrats on being a cog in the giant SEO/clickbait bullshit machine. Be better, if you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you&#8217;re a member of the former category though, for WordPress check Settings &gt; Reading:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/continuereading.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17607" height="413" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/continuereading.jpg?w=1002" width="1002" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Just do it.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there legitimate concerns about having your blog content displayed in an RSS aggregator versus readers coming directly to your blog? Maybe. I have no idea if someone reading this post on Feedly will have their View register on my WordPress stats or whatever. I could also see concerns about post formatting if you care about that sort of thing. For example, I spend an inordinate amount of time trying to avoid orphan words in the blog proper. Seriously, check my posts sometimes (engagement!). None of which matters for Feedly readers though, because those line lengths are all over the place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/orphanwords.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17618" height="124" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/orphanwords.jpg?w=927" width="927" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I hate orphans! </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think me arrogant for suggesting that losing my subscription to your blog is a reason to turn off excerpts. I would instead suggest that forcing readers to open a new tab just for you is itself the height of arrogance. Do you yourself open tabs for every blog you follow every day, like it&#8217;s 2005? No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turn off your excerpts.

While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step. It takes the grand, operatic elements of Star Wars and grounds them in a reality where power is brutal, where ecological concerns dictate the survival of entire civilizations, and where messiahs are as dangerous as they are revered.</p><p>While Star Wars draws inspiration from many sources, including Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films, and Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey, the imprint of Dune is undeniable. Lucas mixed multiple influences to craft his space opera, resulting in a faster-paced, action-driven narrative compared to Dune’s more introspective and politically complex storytelling. If anything, Dune is a deep meditation on power, religion, and fate, while Star Wars leans into mythic adventure and the battle between good and evil.&nbsp;</p><p>Both have left an indelible mark on science fiction, shaping how we imagine galaxies far, far away.&nbsp;</p><p>Here\'s how the team at <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StarWarsExplained" target="_blank">Star Wars Explained</a></em> put it: <em>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Uz-lKT7Jc" target="_blank">How Dune Continues to Inspire Star Wars.</a>"</em></p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><p>In the end, simply know that for those who fell in love with Star Wars, Dune stands waiting—a richer, more demanding, but ultimately rewarding universe to explore.<br /><br />Further readings:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/star-wars-ripped-off-dune" target="_blank">How \'Star Wars\' ripped off \'Dune\'</a> - via The Week</li><li><a href="https://nerdist.com/article/everything-star-wars-borrowed-from-dune/" target="_blank">Everything STAR WARS Borrowed From DUNE</a> - via Nerdist</li><li><a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars-movies-wouldnt-exist-without-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Movies Definitely Wouldn’t Exist Without Dune</a> - via Den of Geek</li><li><a href="https://www.cbr.com/dune-star-wars-similarities-inspiration/" target="_blank">Dune: 10 Ways the Series Inspired Star Wars</a> - via CBR</li><li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonyorlando52/cool-dune-and-star-wars-comparisons" target="_blank">17 "Star Wars" And "Dune" Similarities That Seemingly Tie The Franchises Together</a> - via BuzzFeed</li><li><a href="https://gamerant.com/star-wars-was-based-on-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Was Based On Dune, And It Shows </a>- via Game Rant</li></ul><p></p></div>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq7tgJpqN-t3AdtgsPbsCw9nr-n-fGT077bVls28t9Lu_zvWivNPoomrDmXU5GKk-rvgPFZM_xSQVq8zWlVCOloEA1_kPCqJQuq2tWcx3bSekID1l8VTebx20UU39KimjohC-qAiYovrOJEqbS1oeajcXre8zQD-PYedtdbDWoUckG6ePMIiTkDQ/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202025-03-05%2008.50.03%20-%20A%20dramatic%20sci-fi%20landscape%20divided%20into%20two%20distinct%20halves,%20symbolizing%20two%20different%20universes.%20On%20the%20left,%20a%20vast%20desert%20planet%20with%20towering%20san.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq7tgJpqN-t3AdtgsPbsCw9nr-n-fGT077bVls28t9Lu_zvWivNPoomrDmXU5GKk-rvgPFZM_xSQVq8zWlVCOloEA1_kPCqJQuq2tWcx3bSekID1l8VTebx20UU39KimjohC-qAiYovrOJEqbS1oeajcXre8zQD-PYedtdbDWoUckG6ePMIiTkDQ/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202025-03-05%2008.50.03%20-%20A%20dramatic%20sci-fi%20landscape%20divided%20into%20two%20distinct%20halves,%20symbolizing%20two%20different%20universes.%20On%20the%20left,%20a%20vast%20desert%20planet%20with%20towering%20san.webp" width="640" /></a></div><br />Frank Herbert’s Dune and George Lucas’ Star Wars share a striking number of similarities, from their world-building to their overarching themes.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess.

Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair. The film is set between Alien and Aliens, with a new cast, a new setting, and—hopefully—a return to the franchise’s roots.</p><p></p><p>Now, full disclosure: I haven’t seen it yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But from what I’ve gathered, early reviews suggest that Álvarez might actually get it. Critics have praised the film for leaning into the claustrophobic horror that made the original Alien so iconic. The visuals are supposedly striking, the tension palpable, and Cailee Spaeny’s performance as the lead, Rain, has been getting solid buzz. If Álvarez managed to capture that creeping dread of the original—without bogging it down in over-explained mythology—then we might just have a winner.</p><p>That said, not all reviews are glowing. Some critics feel the film leans too hard on nostalgia, offering little that’s truly new to the franchise. Others have called out a controversial digital recreation of Ian Holm’s Ash, arguing that it adds more distraction than depth. And there’s always the risk that Romulus ends up feeling like a well-shot rehash rather than a true evolution of the saga.</p><p>So, am I hopeful?&nbsp;</p><p>Cautiously, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like <b>Alien: Romulus</b> might finally be the course correction we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p><p>But I won’t know for sure until I see it myself.&nbsp;</p><p>And when I do, you can bet I’ll be back with my thoughts.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/s1280/Alien(1979).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/w640-h360/Alien(1979).png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p>When Alien burst onto the screen in 1979, it was the kind of film that crawled under your skin and stayed there. A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship?

The film is set between Alien and Aliens, with a new cast, a new setting, and—hopefully—a return to the franchise’s roots.</p><p></p><p>Now, full disclosure: I haven’t seen it yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But from what I’ve gathered, early reviews suggest that Álvarez might actually get it. Critics have praised the film for leaning into the claustrophobic horror that made the original Alien so iconic. The visuals are supposedly striking, the tension palpable, and Cailee Spaeny’s performance as the lead, Rain, has been getting solid buzz. If Álvarez managed to capture that creeping dread of the original—without bogging it down in over-explained mythology—then we might just have a winner.</p><p>That said, not all reviews are glowing. Some critics feel the film leans too hard on nostalgia, offering little that’s truly new to the franchise. Others have called out a controversial digital recreation of Ian Holm’s Ash, arguing that it adds more distraction than depth. And there’s always the risk that Romulus ends up feeling like a well-shot rehash rather than a true evolution of the saga.</p><p>So, am I hopeful?&nbsp;</p><p>Cautiously, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like <b>Alien: Romulus</b> might finally be the course correction we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p><p>But I won’t know for sure until I see it myself.&nbsp;</p><p>And when I do, you can bet I’ll be back with my thoughts.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-alien-or-how.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-alien-or-how.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/s72-w640-h360-c/Alien(1979).png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment. Here’s a summary of all six options to help you decide:</p><ul><li><strong>Craftsman:</strong> Increases natural resources by 25%, providing an edge in resource-heavy builds or for cities situated in resource-poor areas.</li><li><strong>Strategist:</strong> Reduces the likelihood of incidents like fires by 20%, keeping your city safe from disasters that can disrupt growth.</li><li><strong>Trader:</strong> Generates passive income from trade routes, a reliable choice if you plan on focusing on a strong economy.</li><li><strong>Politician:</strong> Allows two additional decrees to be issued at a lower cost, giving you more control over civic policies and faster access to certain upgrades.</li><li><strong>Philosopher:</strong> Boosts cultural satisfaction by 15%, making it easier to attract and retain a happy, thriving population.</li><li><strong>Priest:</strong> Citizens make regular offerings of random resources, adding a steady flow of materials that can supplement your supply chain.</li></ul><p>Each path offers distinct benefits depending on your playstyle. For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city. Here’s how to create a well-rounded cultural hub:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Add the ceramic workshop to a district close to residential zones, maximizing its impact on citizen satisfaction.</li><li>Balance satisfaction areas carefully: Focus on health and creativity early on to keep citizens productive and happy.</li><li>Use decorative statues within districts. Strategically placed statues improve attraction and encourage population growth.</li><li>Expand the radius of cultural buildings. When feasible, prioritize cultural buildings that have a broader impact radius to maximize their effectiveness.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">5. Developing Infrastructure: Production and Trade Routes</h2><p>Setting up trade routes is essential for generating income and balancing resources as your city expands. In the playthrough, the author wisely establishes trade routes to sell excess stone and sand for gold, which funds additional buildings and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>\' trade and production systems:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure to unlock and build both the Horreum, a large storehouse, as well as the Macellum, a large market which will open up Trade Routes. Without these two buildings trade will not be possible.</li><li>Identify surplus resources. Selling excess materials like stone and sand brings in steady gold income, which can be used to fund essential upgrades.</li><li>Upgrade production buildings. Increasing output from woodcutting camps and quarries helps meet the growing demand for building materials.</li><li>Create a balanced workforce. Avoid overspecializing in one resource, which could create shortages elsewhere in your economy.</li><li>Invest in a larger marketplace. Upgrading the marketplace opens up more trade routes, offering new opportunities to exchange goods and expand your economy.</li><li>Manage trade efficiently. Check each route’s profitability and ensure you’re getting maximum value from each transaction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">6. Advanced Growth: Reaching the Tier 2 City</h2><p>As your city grows, upgrading to a Tier 2 city brings new buildings and capabilities, allowing for even greater development. However, this stage also introduces new challenges, such as managing faction tensions. Here are a few ways to make the transition smoothly:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Construct safety-focused buildings. Building structures like arenas can help reduce incidents, which become more likely as factions develop tensions.</li><li>Invest in cultural influence points. Advancing through the ages improves your city’s reputation and allows for higher-level upgrades.</li><li>Manage faction relations. Keep an eye on faction satisfaction levels and address issues before they escalate into conflicts. Certain factions may have different needs or preferences.</li><li>Create additional districts. As new buildings become available, expand your residential and industrial districts to accommodate a growing population.</li><li>Save resources for key upgrades. Some Tier 2 buildings are expensive, so stockpile resources like wood, stone, and gold to avoid delays in construction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">7. Unlocking Wonders and Advanced Cultural Buildings</h2><p>Once you’ve secured your city’s basics, investing in wonders and advanced cultural buildings provides significant boosts. In the video, the author demonstrates how to build high-value structures like the arena and the Agoge Center to enhance influence. Here’s a guide to prioritize wonders effectively:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Focus on the Agoge Center&nbsp;or library to boost cultural influence. These buildings improve city-wide satisfaction and increase your cultural reach.</li><li>Place wonders in high-traffic areas to maximize their impact. Wonders near residential zones offer bonuses to more citizens.</li><li>Consider safety upgrades for wonder districts. Building defensive structures near wonders ensures they’re protected from incidents.</li><li>Save resources for construction. Wonders often require substantial materials, so plan to accumulate what you need before starting.</li><li>Regularly expand surveyor cabins. This allows you to build wonders farther out from the core, increasing your city’s total area.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8. Optimizing Faction Management and Decrees</h2><p>At this stage, you’ll encounter factions with unique demands. Managing these factions carefully, especially if they develop tensions, will become an important of your city management. Use decrees and policies to mitigate conflicts and enhance your city’s stability.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Issue decrees strategically. Certain decrees, such as increased food production, improve citizen satisfaction or reduce faction tensions.</li><li>Manage faction trust levels. High trust prevents conflicts, while low trust increases the likelihood of incidents and disputes.</li><li>Consider faction removal if tensions rise too high. Sometimes, expelling a problematic faction is more beneficial than dealing with constant conflicts.</li><li>Create buffers between rival factions. Placing neutral buildings or parks between contentious factions can reduce interactions and potential conflicts.</li><li>Balance decrees for all factions. Ensure that no single faction feels neglected, as this can quickly lead to dissatisfaction.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2><p>Building a successful city in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;requires a careful blend of resource management, cultural development, and strategic planning.

Between work (or trying to find my next role), family, and the general madness of daily life (soccer practices and games, lifts to here and there, the dog, etc.), finding the time to sit down and really immerse yourself in a game can feel like a luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s where city-building games come in, and let me tell you, they\'ve been a game-changer (pun totally intended).</p><span></span><h3 style="text-align: left;">The Magic of the Pause Button</h3><p>First off, let’s talk about one of the biggest perks of city-building games: the ability to pause or stop the game whenever you need to. Whether you\'re deep into a session of Cities: Skylines meticulously planning the perfect road network or trying to ensure your colonists survive another day in Surviving Mars, you can hit pause and step away without missing a beat. No need to worry about respawning in an FPS firefight or letting your team down in the middle of a MOBA match (I could write a whole posts on all the insults I\'ve taken from World of Tanks players).&nbsp;</p><p>These game wait for you, not the other way around.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Meditative Moments in Gaming</h3><p>Additionally, city-building games offer something incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world: a sense of peace and mindfulness. There’s a certain meditative quality to watching your city grow, whether it\'s a bustling metropolis in Cities: Skylines or a fragile colony on the brink of collapse in Frostpunk. You’re not just reacting to what’s happening on screen; you’re crafting something from the ground up, watching your creation evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s like a digital Zen garden, where each decision is a small stone you’re placing just so, bringing order to the chaos. Oh the hundreds of hours I\'ve spent in my Cities Skylines cities, beautifying them with parks, trees and endless landscaping.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Building Something That Lasts (well, sorta)</h3><p>Speaking of crafting, there’s something deeply satisfying about the “building something” aspect of these games. Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge. It’s not about speed or reflexes; it’s about foresight, planning, and adaptability. In Frostpunk, for example, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death for your citizens, adding a layer of moral complexity to the game. It’s a challenge that’s less about adrenaline and more about thoughtful consideration—a welcome break from the usual high-octane fare.</p><p>City-building games like Cities: Skylines, Farthest Frontier, Per Aspera, Frostpunk, and Surviving Mars offer a unique blend of strategy, relaxation, and creativity that’s perfect for casual gamers, especially gamer dads.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re games you can pick up and put down at your convenience, offering a sense of accomplishment without the stress. So next time you’re looking for a game that fits into your busy life, consider giving one of these a try.&nbsp;</p><p>You might just find it’s exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" width="640" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><br /></p><p>Here\'s a short list of some of the games I\'ve enjoyed over the years:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about" target="_blank"><i>Cities: Skylines II</i></a>&nbsp;(2023) - The sequel to the highly acclaimed Cities: Skylines, this game takes city-building to new heights with more advanced tools, deeper simulation, and enhanced graphics.</li><li><a href="https://www.farthestfrontier.com/" target="_blank"><i>Farthest Frontier</i></a> (2022) - A survival city-builder where you manage a frontier settlement, focusing on resource management, farming, and surviving harsh conditions.</li><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/surviving-the-aftermath/about" target="_blank"><i>Surviving the Aftermath</i></a> (2021) - A post-apocalyptic city-builder where you lead a group of survivors to rebuild society after a global catastrophe.</li><li><em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em> (2024) is a city-building game where you guide a city through 2,500 years of history across four eras.

It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge. It’s not about speed or reflexes; it’s about foresight, planning, and adaptability. In Frostpunk, for example, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death for your citizens, adding a layer of moral complexity to the game. It’s a challenge that’s less about adrenaline and more about thoughtful consideration—a welcome break from the usual high-octane fare.</p><p>City-building games like Cities: Skylines, Farthest Frontier, Per Aspera, Frostpunk, and Surviving Mars offer a unique blend of strategy, relaxation, and creativity that’s perfect for casual gamers, especially gamer dads.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re games you can pick up and put down at your convenience, offering a sense of accomplishment without the stress. So next time you’re looking for a game that fits into your busy life, consider giving one of these a try.&nbsp;</p><p>You might just find it’s exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" width="640" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><br /></p><p>Here\'s a short list of some of the games I\'ve enjoyed over the years:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about" target="_blank"><i>Cities: Skylines II</i></a>&nbsp;(2023) - The sequel to the highly acclaimed Cities: Skylines, this game takes city-building to new heights with more advanced tools, deeper simulation, and enhanced graphics.</li><li><a href="https://www.farthestfrontier.com/" target="_blank"><i>Farthest Frontier</i></a> (2022) - A survival city-builder where you manage a frontier settlement, focusing on resource management, farming, and surviving harsh conditions.</li><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/surviving-the-aftermath/about" target="_blank"><i>Surviving the Aftermath</i></a> (2021) - A post-apocalyptic city-builder where you lead a group of survivors to rebuild society after a global catastrophe.</li><li><em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em> (2024) is a city-building game where you guide a city through 2,500 years of history across four eras.

Someone with extensive experience piloting TDs would likely tell you that the following are the best setups, crew skills, and playstyle strategies to help your team secure victory.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Vehicle Setup in Detail</h3><h4 style="text-align: left;">Equipment Choices</h4><p>For both the Hellcat and Super Hellcat, the goal is to maximize their strengths: mobility, concealment, and firepower.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Optics (Binocular Telescope or Coated Optics)</b>: Increasing your view range is critical. Spotting enemies before they spot you allows you to make informed decisions on when to shoot and when to relocate. The choice between Binocular Telescope and Coated Optics depends on your playstyle; Binoculars for more stationary play and Coated Optics for more active scouting and repositioning.</li><li><b>Gun Rammer</b>: Reducing your reload time significantly increases your Damage Per Minute (DPM), making you a bigger threat on the battlefield. Being able to shoot more frequently means you can exploit enemy tanks\' vulnerabilities more often.</li><li><b>Camo Net / Turbocharger</b>: The choice here is between enhancing your stealth with a Camo Net or boosting your mobility with a Turbocharger. The Hellcat, being slightly more geared towards ambush tactics, benefits greatly from a Camo Net. The Super Hellcat, with its enhanced mobility, can further capitalize on this with a Turbocharger, allowing for rapid repositioning and flanking maneuvers.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;">Crew Skills in Detail</h3><p>Developing your crew skills is crucial for maximizing the potential of your TDs.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Commander</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Sixth Sense</b> is non-negotiable for TDs. Knowing when you\'ve been spotted can save you from being quickly eliminated.</li><li><b>Recon</b> further boosts your view range, complementing your equipment choices.</li></ul><li><b>Gunner</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> makes you harder to detect, a key survival trait for a TD.</li><li><b>Snap Shot</b> improves your gun\'s accuracy during turret movements, allowing for more reliable shots after repositioning.</li></ul><li><b>Driver</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Smooth Ride</b> reduces the accuracy penalty when firing on the move, which can be beneficial in hit-and-run tactics.</li><li><b>Off-Road Driving</b> improves your mobility on various terrains, enhancing your ability to quickly get into position or escape danger.</li></ul><li><b>Loader</b>: If your TD has a dedicated loader,</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> further enhances your stealth.</li><li><b>Safe Stowage</b> increases the durability of your ammo rack, reducing the chance of being taken out by a single hit.</li></ul></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Super Hellcat | World of Tanks Best Replays</h2><div style="text-align: center;"></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Gameplay Tactics in Detail</h2><h4 style="text-align: left;">Early Game</h4><p>The initial phase of the match is about gathering intelligence and taking key positions without being overly aggressive.</p><p><b>Scout and Reposition</b>: Use your mobility to reach forward positions quickly. Your goal is to gather as much information as possible on enemy movements for your team. After spotting, fall back to a safe distance before engaging.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Mid to Late Game</h4><p>As the match progresses, your role shifts towards exploiting enemy weaknesses and supporting your team from the second line.</p><p><b>Hit and Run</b>: Identify isolated targets or support teammates by targeting enemies focused on your allies. After firing, immediately relocate to avoid counter-fire, especially from enemy artillery or hidden TDs.</p><p><b>Supporting Heavies</b>: Position yourself behind or beside your team’s heavy tanks. From here, you can safely engage enemies that are distracted by your frontline, using your superior DPM to whittle them down.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Map Movement and Positioning</h3><p>Understanding each map\'s key features and sight lines is crucial. Use terrain to your advantage, keeping in mind that your primary goal is to support your team by dealing damage from concealed positions or by exploiting enemy flanks.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Use Terrain: Always be mindful of hills, ridges, and other terrain features that can provide cover or concealment. Being able to shoot without exposing your tank is a key skill for TD players.</li><li>Avoid Open Fields: Open areas are death zones for lightly armored vehicles like the Hellcat and Super Hellcat. Move from cover to cover and stay aware of potential threats like enemy TDs and artillery.</li><li>High Ground Advantage: High ground not only provides a better view of the battlefield but also makes it harder for enemies to hit your tank. Use elevation to your advantage whenever possible.</li></ul><p></p><p>By focusing on these strategies and continuously practicing and refining your skills, you\'ll greatly contribute to your team\'s efforts and enjoy success in your Hellcat and Super Hellcat in World of Tanks.</p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How a Super Hellcat should tag along with...</h2><div><span><div>The Hellcat, with its blend of mobility, firepower, and limited armor, can significantly benefit from coordinating with certain types of vehicles on the battlefield. Here’s a breakdown of which vehicles a Hellcat should consider partnering with and why:</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Medium Tanks</h3><div>Medium tanks are versatile and can perform a wide range of roles, making them excellent partners for the Hellcat. Their balance of speed, armor, and firepower allows them to effectively scout, flank, and engage enemies at various ranges. A Hellcat can support medium tanks by providing additional firepower from a second line or by exploiting openings created by the mediums’ aggressive maneuvers. This pairing can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions, moving to support weakened flanks or to capitalize on enemy vulnerabilities.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heavy Tanks</h3><div>While heavy tanks lack the Hellcat’s mobility, they make up for it with superior armor and firepower. Teaming up with heavy tanks allows the Hellcat to operate from behind the frontline, using the heavies as a shield while it delivers precise shots. This partnership is especially effective in areas with good cover and long sightlines, where the Hellcat can use its excellent gun to support the heavy tanks without exposing itself to enemy fire. The Hellcat should avoid blocking the retreat paths of allied heavy tanks and remain ready to reposition if the enemy breaks through the frontline.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Other TDs</h3><div>Pairing with other TDs, especially those with strong frontal armor, can create a formidable defensive line that can deter enemy advances. The Hellcat, with its good mobility, can act as a scout or flanker for this group, identifying targets for the more heavily armored TDs to engage. However, this requires good communication and coordination to ensure that the Hellcat does not become isolated or targeted by enemy artillery.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Artillery</h3><div>While not directly tagging along with artillery, a Hellcat can play a crucial role in protecting these valuable assets from enemy scouts and light tanks. By staying relatively close to friendly artillery, the Hellcat can use its mobility and firepower to intercept and eliminate threats to the team’s artillery pieces, ensuring they can continue to support the team effectively.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Light Tanks</h3><div>A somewhat less common but potentially effective partnership can be formed with light tanks. Light tanks excel in scouting and can quickly identify key enemy positions. A Hellcat following a light tank at a safe distance can capitalize on the scouting information, using its accurate gun to take out spotted enemies before they can react. However, this requires the Hellcat to stay alert and ready to move, as the light tank’s fast-paced scouting can lead them into rapidly changing situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>When pairing with any vehicle, the key for the Hellcat driver is to maintain situational awareness and adapt to the battle’s flow. The Hellcat\'s strength lies in its ability to deliver impactful damage from positions where it is not easily targeted. Effective communication with teammates and choosing the right moments to strike or relocate are crucial for leveraging the Hellcat’s capabilities to their fullest.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">How NOT to play the Super Hellcat!</h2></span></div><p style="text-align: left;">One of the worst ways to play the Hellcat in World of Tanks is to treat it like a frontline brawler or a heavy tank. The Hellcat is equipped with a powerful gun and excellent mobility but suffers from very thin armor and a relatively open turret design, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fire from almost all types of weapons it encounters on the battlefield.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Mistakes in Playing the Hellcat as a Frontline Tank:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Engaging in Direct Firefights: Attempting to trade shots with enemy tanks, especially heavies or well-armored mediums and TDs, is a quick way to get destroyed. The Hellcat\'s armor is insufficient to absorb hits, and its relatively large profile for a TD makes it an easy target when exposed.</li><li>Ignoring Cover and Concealment: Failing to use the terrain, bushes, and other forms of cover to hide your tank and mask your movements negates one of the Hellcat\'s main strengths – its ability to strike unseen. Being visible on the front lines means you\'ll likely be one of the first targets to be fired upon.</li><li>Static Gameplay: Staying in one position for too long, especially on the front lines, can make you an easy target for enemy artillery and tanks. The Hellcat thrives on its ability to relocate quickly, providing support where it\'s needed and avoiding return fire.</li><li>Not Using its Mobility: The Hellcat\'s speed is a key feature that allows it to flex across the map, responding to threats, reinforcing failing flanks, or exploiting gaps in the enemy lines. Playing it in a stationary, frontline role wastes this potential, making the tank much less effective than it could be.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Avoid These Mistakes:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Play to Your Strengths: Use the Hellcat\'s mobility and excellent gun handling to engage enemies from unexpected angles, relocate frequently to avoid being targeted, and always look for opportunities to support your team from a distance or the second line.</li><li>Stay Aware: Keep an eye on the mini-map and be ready to move if you\'re in danger of being flanked, or if there\'s a more advantageous position you can take to support your team.</li><li>Engage Wisely: Choose your battles carefully. Look for targets that are engaged with your teammates, isolated, or presenting their weaker armor to you. Avoid head-on engagements with tanks that can easily outgun or outarmor you.</li></ul><p></p><p>By avoiding the frontline brawler playstyle and focusing on mobility, stealth, and strategic engagement, you\'ll greatly increase your effectiveness and survivability in the Hellcat, turning it into a formidable asset for your team.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final thoughts...</h2><p>Mastering the Hellcat and Super Hellcat requires patience, good positioning, and an understanding of when to engage or retreat. Remember, your primary role is to support your team by providing accurate and timely damage from a distance or flanking. Avoid direct confrontations with heavier tanks unless you have a clear advantage or support. By following these strategies and adjusting your playstyle based on the battle\'s flow, you\'ll become a valuable asset to your team and help secure victory on the battlefield.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p>Jumping back into World of Tanks after long hiatus, and a big update felt a bit like a cold splash of water yesterday - especially when I dove straight into battle with my Super Hellcat and ended up more like a skittish kitten hiding in the bushes (literally) than the fierce TD I should\'ve been.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, my gameplay was rusty, and the match didn’t go well at all.

While Fincher\'s film has gained appreciation over time for its atmospheric and stylistic contributions to the franchise, Gibson\'s unproduced screenplay remains a fascinating "what if" scenario that hints at a different direction the "Alien" saga could have taken, potentially offering a more direct continuation of the themes and characters that fans had grown to love in the first two films.</div><div><p></p><p><a href="https://www.audible.ca/pd/Alien-III-Audiobook/B07QWZH5J6?bp_o=true&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAt5euBhB9EiwAdkXWOzX75ZpJJpU6Dii1CcYZWuvJqkjite68jE0tYKh79hvBv7VOWtw46xoCvOgQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;ipRedirectOverride=true&amp;language=en_CA&amp;overrideBaseCountry=true&amp;source_code=GDGPP30DTRIAL548011723005L" target="_blank">Audible\'s audio drama Alien 3 was a brilliant dramatization of the Gibson screenplay</a>, and I highly recommend you give it a listen!</p></div></div>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/exploring-what-if-review-of-william.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/exploring-what-if-review-of-william.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijZHVqQ4oyLsuTd86BXSKGK7ouqMc8C27X9MnhsA4O-V34biRXo4AP55knQnbagEaStNOzUUy4IXGMA_e_YWULmNyD1v5r_Gp7k5smPivZITfQaALFI4CjVeC7Jdop5DvN7NUMB9VoLs4Ozxh4xw2qL4YCJry9GqUMaiplxGjNOOrKANt6D5_2hg/s72-w640-h360-c/Sigourney-Weaver-and-xenomorph-in-Alien-3.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

This makes sense, as a proper compiler library will channel the efforts of contributors into building developer tools, which in turn, will increase the adoption rate of the language. However, progress on this topic has been slow, mainly due to two aspects: (1) the lack of a clear direction, and (2) the intimidating complexity of the DMD frontend, which requires significant work on the compiler codebase.</p>\n<p>The good news is that we now have a plan, which I will outline in this blog post. The bad news is that implementing this plan requires significant effort, and we need more contributors. However, the silver lining is that the work, while extensive, mostly involves refactoring the code. This provides an excellent opportunity for contributors to familiarize themselves with the compiler codebase while delivering real value. Before delving into the specifics, let me give you some background.</p>\n<h2 id="currentstatusandhowwegothere">Current Status And How We Got Here</h2>\n<p>To fully understand the work done so far on the compiler-as-a-library project, I highly recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/eKT3MYpRgYA?si=FwY84BMXYGLtpGgQ">my talk</a> on this subject.</p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Several years ago, we began packaging the compiler as a library.</li>\n<li>Our goal was to clearly separate compilation phases: lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, optimizations, and code generation.</li>\n<li>The parsing and semantic analysis modules were interdependent, necessitating a method for separation.</li>\n<li>We opted to template the parser with an ASTFamily template parameter, defining the AST nodes required for parsing.</li>\n<li>We created ASTBase (containing AST nodes essential for parsing) and ASTCodegen (containing AST nodes needed for code generation).</li>\n<li>ASTBase, as it stands, is code duplicated from ASTCodegen.</li>\n<li>We started extracting semantic routines and fields from AST nodes to eliminate ASTBase&#8217;s code duplication by importing a subset of modules used by ASTCodegen.</li>\n<li>Additionally, we began replacing third-party libraries (like <a href="https://github.com/dlang-community/libdparse/tree/master/src">libdparse</a>) with the DMD-as-a-library package.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more detailed information on each of these points, I recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/eKT3MYpRgYA?si=FwY84BMXYGLtpGgQ">the talk</a> I referenced.</p>\n<p>Recently, I proposed to Walter a modification to the codebase that would significantly enhance the flexibility of the compiler library, allowing any AST node to be overwritten. Walter was hesitant to accept my proposal, concerned about the potential &#8220;ugliness&#8221; it would introduce to the codebase. He cited the addition of ASTBase and the resulting code duplication as a precedent. He then suggested that if we eliminate ASTBase, he would reconsider my proposal.</p>\n<h2 id="whatyoucandotohelp">What You Can Do To Help</h2>\n<p>We are now focused on eliminating the duplication in ASTBase. To achieve this, we need to extract all information related to semantic analysis from the existing AST nodes. The challenge is the sheer number of AST nodes and the multitude of functions associated with each. I have been working on this sporadically over the past few months, and progress is slow due to the nature of the work: it mostly involves moving code, creating visitors, breaking dependencies, etc. While not overly complex, it isn&#8217;t particularly creative work either. However, for someone interested in understanding a real-life compiler codebase, it&#8217;s an ideal starting point.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re willing to support this initiative, I&#8217;ve put together <a href="https://github.com/dlang/dmd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#refactoring-the-dmd-ast">a guide on where to start and what you can do</a>. Feel free to contact me on Slack (razvan.nitu), Discord, or email (razvan.nitu1305@gmail.com) for more details or to request a review of your PR.</p>\n<p>I see this as an excellent opportunity to onboard new people into compiler development in a way that benefits both the language and the contributor. So, if you have some spare time, please join us in getting this work done!</p>'}]}

I even <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/winners.html">won an award</a> for it!</p>\n<p>Although I am a very slow learner, I do learn over time, and gradually the code got better. You’re probably having the same issues with your code. (Or the code written by coworkers, as I agree that <em>your</em> code certainly does not need improvement!)</p>\n<p>This article is about techniques that will help make code self-evident. You are probably already doing some of them. I bet there are some you aren&#8217;t. I also am sure you’re going to argue with me about some of them. Trust me, you’re wrong! If you don’t agree with me now, you will if you’re still programming five years hence.</p>\n<p>I know you’re busy, so let’s jump right in with an observation:</p>\n<p>“Anybody can write complicated code. It takes genius to write simple code.”</p>\n<p>or, if you prefer:</p>\n<p>“The highest accolade your code can garner is: oh pshaw, anybody could have<br />\nwritten that!”</p>\n<p>For example, since I started as an aerospace engineer:</p>\n<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3146" height="1600" src="https://dlang.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lever.jpg" width="1066" /></p>\n<p>consider this lever commonly found in aircraft cockpits. No fair if you already know what it does. Examine it casually. What is it for?</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>It raises and lowers the landing gear. What’s the clue? It’s got a little tire for a knob! Pull the lever up, and the gear gets sucked up. Push it down, the gear goes down. Is that self-evident or what? It’s a masterpiece of simplicity. It doesn’t even need any labels. If the cockpit is filled with smoke, or you&#8217;re focused on what&#8217;s outside the window, your hand knows immediately it’s on the gear lever&mdash;not the flaps or the throttles or the copilot’s ejection seat (just kidding). This kind of stupid simple control is what cockpit designers strive for because pulling the right lever is literally a life-and-death decision. I mean <em>literally</em> in the literal sense of the word.</p>\n<p>This is what we desperately want to achieve in programming. Stupid simple. We’ll probably fail, but the closer the better.</p>\n<p>Diving in&#8230;</p>\n<h3 id="justshootmenow">Just Shoot Me Now</h3>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">#define BEGIN {\n#define END   }</pre>\n<p>Believe it or not, this was common C practice back in the 1980s. It falls into the category of &#8220;Don’t try to make your new language look like your previous language&#8221;. This problem appears in multiple guises. I still tend to name variables in Fortran style from back when the oceans hadn’t yet formed. Before moving to D, I realized that using C macros to invent a personal custom language on top of C was an abomination. Removing it and replacing it with ordinary C code was a big improvement in clarity.</p>\n<h3 id="don’treinventbool">Don’t Reinvent bool</h3>\n<p>Learn what bool is and use it as intended.

It violates the principle that code should not pretend to be in another language. Imagine the inept error messages the compiler will bless you with if there&#8217;s a coding mistake with this. D makes this hard to do by only allowing arithmetic operators to be overloaded, which disallows things like an overloaded unary <code>*</code>.</p>\n<p>(It’s harder, but still possible, to abuse operator overloading in D. But fortunately, making it harder has largely discouraged it.)</p>\n<h4 id="metaprogrammingwithmacros">Metaprogramming with macros</h4>\n<p>Many people have requested macros be added to D. We&#8217;ve resisted this because macros inevitably result in people inventing their own custom, undocumented language layered over D. This makes it impractical for anyone else to make use of this code. In my not-so-humble opinion, macros are the reason why Lisp has never caught on in the mainstream. No Lisper can read anyone else&#8217;s Lisp code.</p>\n<h4 id="cargumentdependentlookup">C++ Argument Dependent Lookup</h4>\n<p>Nobody knows what symbol will actually be found. ADL was added so one could do operator overloading on the left operand. D just has a simple syntax for left or right operand overloading.</p>\n<h4 id="sfinae">SFINAE</h4>\n<p>Nobody knows if SFINAE is in play or not for any particular expression.</p>\n<h4 id="floorwaxortastydesserttopping">Floor Wax or Tasty Dessert Topping</h4>\n<p>This refers to the confusion between a struct being a value type or a reference type or some chimera of both. In D, a struct is a value type and a class is a reference type. To be fair, some people still try to build a D chimera type, but they should be cashiered.</p>\n<h4 id="multipleinheritance">Multiple inheritance</h4>\n<p>Nobody has ever made a convincing case for why this is needed. Things get really nasty when diamond inheritance is used. Pity the next guy and avoid the temptation. D has multiple inheritance for interfaces only, which has proved to be more than adequate.</p>\n<h3 id="codeflow">Code Flow</h3>\n<p>Code should flow from left to right, and top to bottom. Just like how this article is read.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">f() + g() // which executes first?</pre>\n<p>Fortunately, D guarantees a left-to-right ordering (C does not). But what about:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">g(f(e(d(c(b(a))),3)));</pre>\n<p>That executes inside out! Quick, which function call does the <code>3</code> get passed to? D’s Universal Function Call Syntax to the rescue:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">a.b.c.d(3).e.f.g;</pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s the equivalent, but execution flows clearly left-to-right. Is this an extreme example, or the norm?</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import std.stdio;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.algorithm;\n\nvoid main() {\n     stdin.byLine(KeepTerminator.yes).\n     map!(a =&gt; a.idup).\n     array.\n     sort.\n     copy(stdout.lockingTextWriter());\n}</pre>\n<p>This code reads from <code>stdin</code> by lines, puts the lines in an array, sorts the array, and writes the sorted result to <code>stdout</code>. It doesn’t quite meet our &#8220;stupid simple&#8221; criteria, but it is pretty close.

Eventually, I did run across a paper that did do such research and came to the same conclusion as my assumption. I excitedly sent it to Andrei, and to his great credit, he conceded defeat, which is why Andrei is an exceptional man (rare is the person who ever concedes defeat!).</p>\n<p>The lesson here is to avoid using negation in identifiers if at all possible.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (way)</pre>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t that better?</p>\n<h4 id="dmdsourcecodehallofshame">DMD Source Code Hall of Shame</h4>\n<p>My own code is hardly a paragon of virtue.

Only an identifier is allowed&mdash;no negation, AND, OR, or XOR. (Collectively call that <em>version algebra</em>.) Our users often chafe at this restriction, and I get that it&#8217;s difficult to accept the rationale at first. It’s not impossible to do version algebra:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">version (A) { } else {\n    // !A\n}\n\nversion (A) version (B) {\n    // A &amp;&amp; B\n}\n\nversion (A) version = AorB;\nversion (B) version = AorB;\nversion (AorB) {\n     // A || B\n}</pre>\n<p>and so forth. But it’s clumsy and unattractive <em>on purpose</em>. Why would D do such a thing? It’s meant to encourage thinking about versions in a positive manner. Suppose a project has a Windows and an OSX build:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">version (Windows) {\n     ...\n}\nelse version (OSX) {\n     ...\n}\nelse\n     static assert(0, &quot;unsupported operating system&quot;);</pre>\n<p>Isn’t that better than this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">...\nversion (!Windows){\n...\n}</pre>\n<p>I’ve seen an awful lot of that style in C. It makes it pointlessly difficult to add support for a new operating system. After all, what the heck is the &#8220;not Windows&#8221; operating system? That really narrows things down! The former snippet makes it so much easier.</p>\n<p>Taking this a step further:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C &amp;&amp; D)\n\nif (A || B || C || D)</pre>\n<p>are easy for a human to parse. Encountering:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">\nif (A &amp;&amp; (!B || C))</pre>\n<p>is always like transitioning from smooth asphalt to a cobblestone road. Ugh. I&#8217;ve made mistakes with such constructions all the time. Not only is it hard to even see the <code>!</code>, but it’s still hard to satisfy yourself that it is correct.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, De Morgan’s Theorem can sometimes come to the rescue:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">(!A &amp;&amp; !B) =&gt; !(A || B)\n(!A || !B) =&gt; !(A &amp;&amp; B)</pre>\n<p>It gets rid of one negation. Repeated application can often transform it into a much more easily understood equation while being equally correct.</p>\n<p>Anecdote: When designing digital logic circuits, the NAND gate is more efficient than the AND gate because it has one less transistor. (AND means (A &amp;&amp; B), NAND means !(A &amp;&amp; B)). But humans just stink at crafting bug-free NAND logic. When I worked on the design of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Boolean_Expression_Language">ABEL programming language</a> back in the 1980s, which was for programming Programmable Logic Devices, ABEL would accept input in positive logic. It would use De Morgan’s theorem to automatically convert it to efficient negative logic.

Sometimes you just gotta have them (to implement <code>malloc</code>, for example, the result needs a cast), but far too often they are simply there to correct sloppy misuse of types. Hence, in D casts are done with the keyword <code>cast</code>, not a peculiar syntax, making them easily greppable. It&#8217;s worthwhile to occasionally grep a code base for <code>cast</code> and see if the types can be reworked to eliminate the need for the cast and have the type system working for rather than against you.</p>\n<p>Pull Request: <a href="https://github.com/dlang/dmd/pull/15488">remove some dyncast calls</a></p>\n<h3 id="self-documentingfunctiondeclarations">Self-Documenting Function Declarations</h3>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">char* xyzzy(char* p)</pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Does <code>p</code> modify what it points to?</li>\n<li>Is <code>p</code> returned?</li>\n<li>Does <code>xyzzy</code> free <code>p</code>?</li>\n<li>Does <code>xyzzy</code> save <code>p</code> somewhere, like in a global?</li>\n<li>Does <code>xyzzy</code> throw <code>p</code>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These crucial bits of information are rarely noted in the documentation for the function.

Yes, it is called &#8220;attribute soup&#8221; for good reason, and takes some getting used to, but it&#8217;s still better than bad documentation, and adding attributes is optional.</p>\n<h3 id="functionargumentsandreturns">Function Arguments and Returns</h3>\n<p>Function inputs and outputs present in the function declaration are the &#8220;front door&#8221;. Any inputs and outputs that are not in the function declaration are &#8220;side doors&#8221;. Side doors include things like global variables, environment variables, getting information from the operating system, reading/writing files, throwing exceptions, etc. Side doors are rarely accounted for in the documentation. The poor sap calling a function has to carefully read its implementation to discern what the side doors are.</p>\n<p>Self-evident code should strive to run everything through the front door. Not only does this help with comprehension, but it also enables delightful things like easy unit testing.</p>\n<h3 id="memoryallocation">Memory Allocation</h3>\n<p>An ongoing problem faced by functions that implement an algorithm that needs to allocate memory is what memory allocation scheme should be used. Often a reusable function imposes the memory allocation method on the caller. That&#8217;s backward.</p>\n<p>For memory that is allocated and free&#8217;d by the function, the solution is that the function decides how to do it. For allocated objects that are returned by the function, the caller should decide the allocation scheme by passing an argument that specifies it. This argument often takes the form of a &#8220;sink&#8221; to send the output to. More on that later.</p>\n<h3 id="passabstract“sink”foroutput">Pass Abstract “sink” for Output</h3>\n<p>The auld way (extracted from the DMD source code):</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import dmd.errors;\nvoid gendocfile(Module m) {\n     ...\n     if (!success)\n         error(&quot;expansion limit&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<p><code>error()</code> is a function that error messages are sent to. This is a typical formulation seen in conventional code. The error message is going out through the side door. The caller of <code>gendocfile()</code> has no say in what&#8217;s done with the error message, and the fact that it even generates error messages is usually omitted by the documentation. Worse, the error message emission makes it impractical to properly unit test the function.</p>\n<p>A better way is to pass an abstract interface &#8220;sink&#8221; as a parameter and send the error messages to the sink:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import dmd.errorsink;\nvoid gendocfile(Module m, ErrorSink eSink) {\n     ...\n     if (!success)\n         eSink.error(&quot;expansion limit&quot;);\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Now the caller has total control of what happens to the error messages, and it is implicitly documented.

This kept the first two posts simpler in that they did not have to deal with function attribute inference, which I have referred to as &#8220;attribute auto inference&#8221; in earlier posts. However, both <code>auto</code> functions and templates are very common in D code, so a series on DIP1000 can&#8217;t be complete without explaining how those features work with the language changes. Function attribute inference is our most important tool in avoiding so-called &#8220;attribute soup&#8221;, where a function is decorated with several attributes, which arguably decreases readability.</p>\n<p>We will also dig deeper into unsafe code. The previous two posts in this series focused on the <code>scope</code> attribute, but this post is more focused on attributes and memory safety in general. Since DIP1000 is ultimately about memory safety, we can&#8217;t get around discussing those topics.</p>\n<h2 id="avoidingrepetitionwithattributes">Avoiding repetition with attributes</h2>\n<p><a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#function-attribute-inference">Function attribute inference</a> means that the language will analyze the body of a function and will automatically add the <code>@safe</code>, <code>pure</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, and <code>@nogc</code> attributes where applicable. It will also attempt to add <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> attributes to parameters and <code>return ref</code> to <code>ref</code> parameters that can&#8217;t otherwise be compiled. Some attributes are never inferred. For instance, the compiler will not insert any <code>ref</code>, <code>lazy</code>, <code>out</code> or <code>@trusted</code> attributes, because very likely they are explicitly not wanted where they are left out.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to turn on function attribute inference. One is by omitting the return type in the function signature. Note that the <code>auto</code> keyword is not required for this. <code>auto</code> is a placeholder keyword used when no return type, storage class, or attribute is specified. For example, the declaration <code>half(int x) { return x/2; }</code> does not parse, so we use <code>auto half(int x) { return x/2; }</code> instead. But we could just as well write <code>@safe half(int x) { return x/2; }</code> and the rest of the attributes (<code>pure</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, and <code>@nogc</code>) will be inferred just as they are with the <code>auto</code> keyword.</p>\n<p>The second way to enable attribute inference is to templatize the function. With our <code>half</code> example, it can be done this way:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">int divide(int denominator)(int x) { return x/denominator; }\nalias half = divide!2;</pre>\n<p>The D spec does not say that a template must have any parameters. An empty parameter list can be used to turn attribute inference on: <code>int half()(int x) { return x/2; }</code>. Calling this function doesn&#8217;t even require the template instantiation syntax at the call site, e.g., <code>half!()(12)</code> is not required as <code>half(12)</code> will compile.</p>\n<p>Another means to turn on attribute inference is to store the function inside another function. <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#nested">These are called nested functions</a>. Inference is enabled not only on functions nested directly inside another function but also on most things nested in a type or a template inside the function. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void parentFun()\n{\n    // This is auto-inferred.\n    int half(int x){ return x/2; }\n\n    class NestedType\n    {\n        // This is auto inferred\n        final int half1(int x) { return x/2; }\n\n        // This is not auto inferred; it\'s a\n        // virtual function and the compiler\n        // can\'t know if it has an unsafe override\n        // in a derived class.\n        int half2(int x) { return x/2; }\n    }\n\n    int a = half(12); // Works. Inferred as @safe.\n    auto cl = new NestedType;\n    int b = cl.half1(18); // Works. Inferred as @safe.\n    int c = cl.half2(26); // Error.\n}</pre>\n<p>A downside of nested functions is that they can only be used in lexical order (the call site must be below the function declaration) unless both the nested function and the call are inside the same struct, class, union, or template that is in turn inside the parent function. Another downside is that they don&#8217;t work with <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#pseudo-member">Uniform Function Call Syntax</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, attribute inference is always enabled for <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/expression.html#FunctionLiteral">function literals</a> (a.k.a. lambda functions). The halving function would be defined as <code>enum half = (int x) =&gt; x/2;</code> and called exactly as normal. However, the language does not consider this declaration a function. It considers it a function pointer. This means that in global scope it&#8217;s important to use <code>enum</code> or <code>immutable</code> instead of <code>auto</code>. Otherwise, the lambda can be changed to something else from anywhere in the program and cannot be accessed from <code>pure</code> functions. In rare cases, such mutability can be desirable, but most often it is an antipattern (like global variables in general).</p>\n<h3 id="limitsofinference">Limits of inference</h3>\n<p>Aiming for minimal manual typing isn&#8217;t always wise. Neither is aiming for maximal attribute bloat.</p>\n<p>The primary problem of auto inference is that subtle changes in the code can lead to inferred attributes turning on and off in an uncontrolled manner. To see when it matters, we need to have an idea of what will be inferred and what will not.</p>\n<p>The compiler in general will go to great lengths to infer <code>@safe</code>, <code>pure</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, and <code>@nogc</code> attributes. If your function <em>can</em> have those, it almost always will. The specification says that recursion is an exception: a function calling itself should not be <code>@safe</code>, <code>pure</code>, or <code>nothrow</code> unless explicitly specified as such. But in my testing, I found those attributes actually are inferred for recursive functions. It turns out, there is an ongoing effort to get recursive attribute inference working, and it partially works already.</p>\n<p>Inference of <code>scope</code> and <code>return</code> on function parameters is less reliable. In the most mundane cases, it&#8217;ll work, but the compiler gives up pretty quickly. The smarter the inference engine is, the more time it takes to compile, so the current design decision is to infer those attributes in only the simplest of cases.</p>\n<h3 id="wheretoletthecompilerinfer">Where to let the compiler infer?</h3>\n<p>A D programmer should get into the habit of asking, &#8220;What will happen if I mistakenly do something that makes this function unsafe, impure, throwing, garbage-collecting, or escaping?&#8221; If the answer is &#8220;immediate compiler error&#8221;, auto inference is probably fine. On the other hand, the answer could be &#8220;user code will break when updating this library I&#8217;m maintaining&#8221;. In that case, annotate manually.</p>\n<p>In addition to the potential of losing attributes the author intends to apply, there is also another risk:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe pure nothrow @nogc firstNewline(string from)\n{\n    foreach(i; 0 .. from.length) switch(from[i])\n    {\n        case \'\\r\':\n        if(from.length &gt; i+1 &amp;&amp; from[i+1] == \'\\n\')\n        {\n            return &quot;\\r\\n&quot;;\n        }\n        else return &quot;\\r&quot;;\n\n        case \'\\n\': return &quot;\\n&quot;;\n\n        default: break;\n    }\n\n    return &quot;&quot;;\n}\n</pre>\n<p>You might think that since the author is manually specifying the attributes, there&#8217;s no problem. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s wrong. Suppose the author decides to rewrite the function such that all the return values are slices of the <code>from</code> parameter rather than string literals:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe pure nothrow @nogc firstNewline(string from)\n{\n    foreach(i; 0 .. from.length) switch(from[i])\n    {\n        case \'\\r\':\n        if (from.length &gt; i + 1 &amp;&amp; from[i + 1] == \'\\n\')\n        {\n            return from[i .. i + 2];\n        }\n        else return from[i .. i + 1];\n\n        case \'\\n\': return from[i .. i + 1];\n\n        default: break;\n    }\n\n    return &quot;&quot;;\n}</pre>\n<p>Surprise! The parameter <code>from</code> was previously inferred as <code>scope</code>, and a library user was relying on that, but now it&#8217;s inferred as <code>return scope</code> instead, breaking client code.</p>\n<p>Still, for internal functions, auto inference is a great way to save both our fingers when writing and our eyes when reading. Note that it&#8217;s perfectly fine to rely on auto inference of the <code>@safe</code> attribute as long as the function is used in explicitly in <code>@safe</code> functions or unit tests. If something potentially unsafe is done inside the auto-inferred function, it gets inferred as <code>@system</code>, not <code>@trusted</code>. Calling a <code>@system</code> function from a <code>@safe</code> function results in a compiler error, meaning auto inference is safe to rely on in this case.</p>\n<p>It still sometimes makes sense to manually apply attributes to internal functions, because the error messages generated when they are violated tend to be better with manual attributes.</p>\n<h3 id="whatabouttemplates">What about templates?</h3>\n<p>Auto inference is always enabled for templated functions. What if a library interface needs to expose one? There is a way to block the inference, albeit an ugly one:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">private template FunContainer(T)\n{\n    // Not auto inferred\n    // (only eponymous template functions are)\n    @safe T fun(T arg){return arg + 3;}\n}\n\n// Auto inferred per se, but since the function it calls\n// is not, only @safe is inferred.\nauto addThree(T)(T arg){return FunContainer!T.fun(arg);}</pre>\n<p>However, which attributes a template should have often depends on its compile-time parameters. It would be possible to use metaprogramming to designate attributes depending on the template parameters, but that would be a lot of work, hard to read, and easily as error-prone as relying on auto inference.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s more practical to just test that the function template infers the wanted attributes. Such testing doesn&#8217;t have to, and probably shouldn&#8217;t, be done manually each time the function is changed. Instead:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">float multiplyResults(alias fun)(float[] arr)\n    if (is(typeof(fun(new float)) : float))\n{\n    float result = 1.0f;\n    foreach (ref e; arr) result *= fun(&amp;e);\n    return result;\n}\n\n@safe pure nothrow unittest\n{\n    float fun(float* x){return *x+1;}\n    // Using a static array makes sure\n    // arr argument is inferred as scope or\n    // return scope\n    float[5] elements = [1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f];\n\n    // No need to actually do anything with\n    // the result. The idea is that since this\n    // compiles, multiplyResults is proven @safe\n    // pure nothrow, and its argument is scope or\n    // return scope.\n    multiplyResults!fun(elements);\n}</pre>\n<p>Thanks to D&#8217;s compile-time introspection powers, testing against unwanted attributes is also covered:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe unittest\n{\n    import std.traits : attr = FunctionAttribute,\n        functionAttributes, isSafe;\n\n    float fun(float* x)\n    {\n        // Makes the function both throwing\n        // and garbage collector dependant.\n        if (*x &gt; 5) throw new Exception(&quot;&quot;);\n        static float* impureVar;\n\n        // Makes the function impure.\n        auto result = impureVar? *impureVar: 5;\n\n        // Makes the argument unscoped.\n        impureVar = x;\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    enum attrs = functionAttributes!(multiplyResults!fun);\n\n    assert(!(attrs &amp; attr.nothrow_));\n    assert(!(attrs &amp; attr.nogc));\n\n    // Checks against accepting scope arguments.\n    // Note that this check does not work with\n    // @system functions.\n    assert(!isSafe!(\n    {\n        float[5] stackFloats;\n        multiplyResults!fun(stackFloats[]);\n    }));\n\n    // It\'s a good idea to do positive tests with\n    // similar methods to make sure the tests above\n    // would fail if the tested function had the\n    // wrong attributes.\n    assert(attrs &amp; attr.safe);\n    assert(isSafe!(\n    {\n        float[] heapFloats;\n        multiplyResults!fun(heapFloats[]);\n    }));\n}</pre>\n<p>If assertion failures are wanted at compile time before the unit tests are run, adding the <code>static</code> keyword before each of those <code>assert</code>s will get the job done. Those compiler errors can even be had in non-unittest builds by converting that unit test to a regular function, e.g., by replacing <code>@safe unittest</code> with, say, <code>private @safe testAttrs()</code>.</p>\n<h2 id="thelivefireexercise:system">The live fire exercise: @system</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that D is a systems programming language. As this series has shown, in most D code the programmer is well protected from memory errors, but D would not be D if it didn&#8217;t allow going low-level and bypassing the type system in the same manner as C or C++: bit arithmetic on pointers, writing and reading directly to hardware ports, executing a <code>struct</code> destructor on a raw byte blob&#8230; D is designed to do all of that.</p>\n<p>The difference is that in C and C++ it takes only one mistake to break the type system and <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213">cause undefined behavior</a> anywhere in the code. A D programmer is only at risk when not in a <code>@safe</code> function, or when using dangerous compiler switches such as <code>-release</code> or <code>-check=assert=off</code> (failing a disabled assertion is undefined behavior), and even then the semantics tend to be less UB-prone. For example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">float cube(float arg)\n{\n    float result;\n    result *= arg;\n    result *= arg;\n    return result;\n}</pre>\n<p>This is a language-agnostic function that compiles in C, C++, and D. Someone intended to calculate the cube of <code>arg</code> but forgot to initialize <code>result</code> with <code>arg</code>. In D, nothing dangerous happens despite this being a <code>@system</code> function. No initialization value means <code>result</code> is default initialized to <code>NaN</code> (not-a-number), which leads to the result also being <code>NaN</code>, which is a glaringly obvious &#8220;error&#8221; value when using this function the first time.</p>\n<p>However, in C and C++, not initializing a local variable means reading it is (sans a few narrow exceptions) <em>undefined behavior</em>. This function does not even handle pointers, yet according to the standard, calling this function could just as well have <code>*(int*) rand() = 0XDEADBEEF;</code> in it, all due to a trivial mistake. While many compilers with enabled warnings will catch this one, not all do, and these languages are full of similar examples where even warnings don&#8217;t help.</p>\n<p>In D, even if you explicitly requested no default initialization with <code>float result = void</code>, it&#8217;d just mean the return value of the function is undefined, not anything and everything that happens if the function is called. Consequently, that function could be annotated <code>@safe</code> even with such an initializer.</p>\n<p>Still, for anyone who cares about memory safety, as they probably should for anything intended for a wide audience, it&#8217;s a bad idea to assume that D <code>@system</code> code is safe enough to be the default mode. Two examples will demonstrate what can happen.</p>\n<h3 id="whatundefinedbehaviorcando">What undefined behavior can do</h3>\n<p>Some people assume that &#8220;Undefined Behavior&#8221; simply means &#8220;erroneous behavior&#8221; or crashing at runtime. While that is often what ultimately happens, undefined behavior is far more dangerous than, say, an uncaught exception or an infinite loop. The difference is that with undefined behavior, you have no guarantees at all about what happens. This might not sound any worse than an infinite loop, but an accidental infinite loop is discovered the first time it&#8217;s entered. Code with undefined behavior, on the other hand, might do what was intended when it&#8217;s tested, but then do something completely different in production. Even if the code is tested with the same flags it&#8217;s compiled with in production, the behavior may change from one compiler version to another, or when making completely unrelated changes to the code. Time for an example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// return whether the exception itself is in the array\nbool replaceExceptions(Object[] arr, ref Exception e)\n{\n    bool result;\n    foreach (ref o; arr)\n    {\n        if (&amp;o is &amp;e) result = true;\n        if (cast(Exception) o) o = e;\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}</pre>\n<p>The idea here is that the function replaces all exceptions in the array with <code>e</code>. If <code>e</code> itself is in the array, it returns <code>true</code>, otherwise <code>false</code>. And indeed, testing confirms it works. The function is used like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto arr = [new Exception(&quot;a&quot;), null, null, new Exception(&quot;c&quot;)];\nauto result = replaceExceptions\n(\n    cast(Object[]) arr,\n    arr[3]\n);</pre>\n<p>This cast is not a problem, right? Object references are always of the same size regardless of their type, and we&#8217;re casting the exceptions to the parent type, <code>Object</code>. It&#8217;s not like the array contains anything other than object references.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not how <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/expression.html#AssignExpression">the D specification views it</a>. Having two class references (or any references, for that matter) in the same memory location but with different types, and then assigning one of them to the other, is undefined behavior. That&#8217;s exactly what happens in</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (cast(Exception) o) o = e;</pre>\n<p>if the array does contain the <code>e</code> argument. Since <code>true</code> can only be returned when undefined behavior is triggered, it means that any compiler would be free to optimize <code>replaceExceptions</code> to always return <code>false</code>. This is a dormant bug no amount of testing will find, but that might, years later, completely mess up the application when compiled with the powerful optimizations of an advanced compiler.</p>\n<p>It may seem that requiring a cast to use a function is an obvious warning sign that a good D programmer would not ignore. I wouldn&#8217;t be so sure. Casts aren&#8217;t that rare even in fine high-level code. Even if you disagree, other cases are provably bad enough to bite anyone. Last summer, this case <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/thread/t7qd45$1lrb$1@digitalmars.com">appeared in the D forums</a>:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">string foo(in string s)\n{\n    return s;\n}\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    import std.stdio;\n    string[] result;\n    foreach(c; &quot;hello&quot;)\n    {\n        result ~= foo([c]);\n    }\n    writeln(result);\n}</pre>\n<p>This problem was encountered by Steven Schveighoffer, a long-time D veteran who has himself <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/2016/09/28/how-to-write-trusted-code-in-d/">lectured about <code>@safe</code> and <code>@system</code></a> on <a href="https://dconf.org/2020/online/#steven">more than one occasion</a>. Anything that can burn him can burn any of us.</p>\n<p>Normally, this works just as one would think and is fine according to the spec. However, if one enables <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#in-params">another soon-to-be-default language feature</a> with the <code>-preview=in</code> compiler switch along with DIP1000, the program starts malfunctioning. The old semantics for <code>in</code> are the same as <code>const</code>, but the new semantics make it <code>const scope</code>.</p>\n<p>Since the argument of <code>foo</code> is <code>scope</code>, the compiler assumes that <code>foo</code> will copy <code>[c]</code> before returning it, or return something else, and therefore it allocates <code>[c]</code> on the same stack position for each of the &#8220;hello&#8221; letters. The result is that the program prints <code>[&quot;o&quot;, &quot;o, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;o&quot;]</code>. At least for me, it&#8217;s already somewhat hard to understand what&#8217;s happening in this simple example. Hunting down this sort of bug in a complex codebase could be a nightmare.</p>\n<p>(With my nightly DMD version somewhere between 2.100 and 2.101 a compile-time error is printed instead. With 2.100.2, the example runs as described above.)</p>\n<p>The fundamental problem in both of these examples is the same: <code>@safe</code> is not used. Had it been, both of these undefined behaviors would have resulted in compilation errors (the <code>replaceExceptions</code> function itself can be <code>@safe</code>, but the cast at the usage site cannot). By now it should be clear that <code>@system</code> code should be used sparingly.</p>\n<h3 id="whentoproceedanyway">When to proceed anyway</h3>\n<p>Sooner or later, though, the time comes when the guard rail has to be temporarily lowered. Here&#8217;s an example of a good use case:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">/// Undefined behavior: Passing a non-null pointer\n/// to a standalone character other than \'\\0\', or\n/// to an array without \'\\0\' at or after the\n/// pointed character, as utf8Stringz\nextern(C) @system pure\nbool phobosValidateUTF8(const char* utf8Stringz)\n{\n    import std.string, std.utf;\n\n    try utf8Stringz.fromStringz.validate();\n    catch (UTFException) return false;\n\n    return true;\n}</pre>\n<p>This function lets code written in another language validate a UTF-8 string using Phobos. C being C, it tends to use zero-terminated strings, so the function accepts a pointer to one as the argument instead of a D array. This is why the function has to be unsafe. There is no way to safely check that <code>utf8Stringz</code> is pointing to either <code>null</code> or a valid C string. If the character being pointed to is not <code>\'\\0\'</code>, meaning the next character has to be read, the function has no way of knowing whether that character belongs to the memory allocated for the string. It can only trust that the calling code got it right.</p>\n<p>Still, this function is a good use of the <code>@system</code> attribute. First, it is presumably called primarily from C or C++. Those languages do not get any safety guarantees anyway. Even a <code>@safe</code> function is safe only if it gets only those parameters that can be created in <code>@safe</code> D code. Passing <code>cast(const char*) 0xFE0DA1</code> as an argument to a function is unsafe no matter what the attribute says, and nothing in C or C++ verifies what arguments are passed.</p>\n<p>Second, the function clearly documents the cases that would trigger undefined behavior. However, it does not mention that passing an invalid pointer, such as the aforementioned <code>cast(const char*) 0xFE0DA1</code>, is UB, because UB is always the default assumption with <code>@system</code>-only values unless it can be shown otherwise.</p>\n<p>Third, the function is small and easy to review manually. No function should be needlessly big, but it&#8217;s many times more important than usual to keep <code>@system</code> and <code>@trusted</code> functions small and simple to review. <code>@safe</code> functions can be debugged to pretty good shape by testing, but as we saw earlier, undefined behavior can be immune to testing. Analyzing the code is the only general answer to UB.</p>\n<p>There is a reason why the parameter does not have a <code>scope</code> attribute. It could have it, no pointers to the string are escaped. However, it would not provide many benefits. Any code calling the function has to be <code>@system</code>, <code>@trusted</code>, or in a foreign language, meaning they can pass a pointer to the stack in any case. <code>scope</code> could potentially improve the performance of D client code in exchange for the increased potential for undefined behavior if this function is erroneously refactored. Such a tradeoff is unwanted in general unless it can be shown that the attribute helps with a performance problem. On the other hand, the attribute would make it clearer for the reader that the string is not supposed to escape. It&#8217;s a difficult judgment call whether <code>scope</code> would be a wise addition here.</p>\n<h3 id="furtherimprovements">Further improvements</h3>\n<p>It should be documented why a <code>@system</code> function is <code>@system</code> when it&#8217;s not obvious. Often there is a safer alternative&mdash;our example function could have taken a D array or the CString struct from the previous post in this series. Why was an alternative not taken? In our case, we could write that the ABI would be different for either of those options, complicating matters on the C side, and the intended client (C code) is unsafe anyway.</p>\n<p><code>@trusted</code> functions are like <code>@system</code> functions, except they can be called from <code>@safe</code> functions, whereas <code>@system</code> functions cannot. When something is declared <code>@trusted</code>, it means the authors have verified that it&#8217;s just as safe to use as an actual <code>@safe</code> function with any arguments that can be created within safe code. They need to be just as carefully reviewed, if not more so, as <code>@system</code> functions.</p>\n<p>In these situations, it should be documented (for other developers, not users) how the function was deemed to be safe in all situations. Or, if the function is not fully safe to use and the attribute is just a temporary hack, it should have a big ugly warning about that.</p>\n<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3131" height="383" src="https://dlang.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/unsafe-safe.jpg" width="651" /></p>\n<p>Such greenwashing is of course highly discouraged, but if there&#8217;s a codebase full of <code>@system</code> code that&#8217;s just too difficult to make <code>@safe</code> otherwise, it&#8217;s better than giving up. Even as we often talk about the dangers of UB and memory corruption, in our actual work our attitudes tend to be much more carefree, meaning such codebases are unfortunately common.</p>\n<p>It might be tempting to define a small <code>@trusted</code> function inside a bigger <code>@safe</code> function to do something unsafe without disabling checks for the whole function:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">extern(C) @safe pure\nbool phobosValidateUTF8(const char* utf8Stringz)\n{\n    import std.string, std.utf;\n\n    try (() @trusted =&gt; utf8Stringz.fromStringz)()\n      .validate();\n    catch (UTFException) return false;\n\n    return true;\n}</pre>\n<p>Keep in mind though, that the parent function needs to be documented and reviewed like an overt <code>@trusted</code> function because the encapsulated <code>@trusted</code> function can let the parent function do anything. In addition, since the function is marked <code>@safe</code>, it isn&#8217;t obvious on a first look that it&#8217;s a function that needs special care. Thus, a visible warning comment is needed if you elect to use <code>@trusted</code> like this.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, don&#8217;t trust yourself! Just like any codebase of non-trivial size has bugs, more than a handful of <code>@system</code> functions will include latent UB at some point. The remaining hardening features of D, meaning asserts, contracts, invariants, and bounds checking should be used aggressively and kept enabled in production. This is recommended even if the program is fully <code>@safe</code>. In addition, a project with a considerable amount of unsafe code should use external tools like LLVM address sanitizer and Valgrind to at least some extent.</p>\n<p>Note that the idea in many of these hardening tools, both those in the language and those of the external tools, is to crash as soon as any fault is detected. It decreases the chance of any surprise from undefined behavior doing more serious damage.</p>\n<p>This requires that the program is designed to accept a crash at any moment. The program must never hold such amounts of unsaved data that there would be any hesitation in crashing it. If it controls anything important, it must be able to regain control after being restarted by a user or another process, or it must have another backup program. Any program that &#8220;can&#8217;t afford&#8221; to run potentially crashing checks is in no business to be trusted with systems programming either.</p>\n<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>That concludes this blog series on DIP1000.

But D can refer to the stack in other ways, too, and that&#8217;s the topic of this article.</p>\n<h2 id="object-orientedinstancesaretheeasiestcase">Object-oriented instances are the easiest case</h2>\n<p>In Part 1, I said that if you understand how DIP1000 works with pointers, then you understand how it works with classes. An example is worth more than mere words:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe Object ifNull(return scope Object a, return scope Object b)\n{\n    return a? a: b;\n}</pre>\n<p>The <code>return scope</code> in the above example works exactly as it does in the following:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int* ifNull(return scope int* a, return scope int* b)\n{\n    return a? a: b;\n}</pre>\n<p>The principle is: if the <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> storage class is applied to an object in a parameter list, the address of the object instance is protected just as if the parameter were a pointer to the instance. From the perspective of machine code, it <strong>is</strong> a pointer to the instance.</p>\n<p>From the point of view of regular functions, that&#8217;s all there is to it. What about member functions of a class or an interface? This is how it&#8217;s done:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">interface Talkative\n{\n    @safe const(char)[] saySomething() scope;\n}\n\nclass Duck : Talkative\n{\n    char[8] favoriteWord;\n    @safe const(char)[] saySomething() scope\n    {\n        import std.random : dice;\n\n        // This wouldn\'t work\n        // return favoriteWord[];\n\n        // This does\n        return favoriteWord[].dup;\n\n        // Also returning something totally\n        // different works. This\n        // returns the first entry 40% of the time,\n        // The second entry 40% of the time, and\n        // the third entry the rest of the time.\n        return\n        [\n            &quot;quack!&quot;,\n            &quot;Quack!!&quot;,\n            &quot;QUAAACK!!!&quot;\n        ][dice(2,2,1)];\n    }\n}</pre>\n<p><code>scope</code> positioned either before or after the member function name marks the <code>this</code> reference as <code>scope</code>, preventing it from leaking out of the function. Because the address of the instance is protected, nothing that refers directly to the address of the fields is allowed to escape either. That&#8217;s why <code>return favoriteWord[]</code> is disallowed; it&#8217;s a static array stored inside the class instance, so the returned slice would refer directly to it. <code>favoriteWord[].dup</code> on the other hand returns a copy of the data that isn&#8217;t located in the class instance, which is why it&#8217;s okay.</p>\n<p>Alternatively one could replace the <code>scope</code> attributes of both <code>Talkative.saySomething</code> and <code>Duck.saySomething</code> with <code>return scope</code>, allowing the return of <code>favoriteWord</code> without duplication.</p>\n<h3 id="dip1000andliskovsubstitutionprinciple">DIP1000 and Liskov Substitution Principle</h3>\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">The Liskov substitution principle</a> states, in simplified terms, that an inherited function can give the caller more guarantees than its parent function, but never fewer. DIP1000-related attributes fall in that category. The rule works like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> if a parameter (including the implicit <code>this</code> reference) in the parent functions has no DIP1000 attributes, the child function may designate it <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code></li>\n<li> if a parameter is designated <code>scope</code> in the parent, it must be designated <code>scope</code> in the child</li>\n<li> if a parameter is <code>return scope</code> in the parent, it must be either <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> in the child</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there is no attribute, the caller can not assume anything; the function might store the address of the argument somewhere. If <code>return scope</code> is present, the caller can assume the address of the argument is not stored other than in the return value. With <code>scope</code>, the guarantee is that the address is not stored anywhere, which is an even stronger guarantee. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">class C1\n{   double*[] incomeLog;\n    @safe double* imposeTax(double* pIncome)\n    {\n        incomeLog ~= pIncome;\n        return new double(*pIncome * .15);\n    }\n}\n\nclass C2 : C1\n{\n    // Okay from language perspective (but maybe not fair\n    // for the taxpayer)\n    override @safe double* imposeTax\n        (return scope double* pIncome)\n    {\n        return pIncome;\n    }\n}\n\nclass C3 : C2\n{\n    // Also okay.\n    override @safe double* imposeTax\n        (scope double* pIncome)\n    {\n        return new double(*pIncome * .18);\n    }\n}\n\nclass C4: C3\n{\n    // Not okay. The pIncome parameter of C3.imposeTax\n    // is scope, and this tries to relax the restriction.\n    override @safe double* imposeTax\n        (double* pIncome)\n    {\n        incomeLog ~= pIncome;\n        return new double(*pIncome * .16);\n    }\n}</pre>\n<h2 id="thespecialpointerref">The special pointer, <code>ref</code></h2>\n<p>We still have not uncovered how to use <code>struct</code>s and <code>union</code>s with DIP1000. Well, obviously we&#8217;ve uncovered pointers and arrays. When referring to a <code>struct</code> or a <code>union</code>, they work the same as they do when referring to any other type. But pointers and arrays are not the canonical way to use structs in D. They are most often passed around by value, or by reference when <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#ref-params">bound to <code>ref</code> parameters</a>. Now is a good time to explain how <code>ref</code> works with DIP1000.</p>\n<p>They don&#8217;t work like just any pointer. Once you understand <code>ref</code>, you can use DIP1000 in many ways you otherwise could not.</p>\n<h3 id="asimplerefintparameter">A simple <code>ref int</code> parameter</h3>\n<p>The simplest possible way to use <code>ref</code> is probably this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void fun(ref int arg) {\n    arg = 5;\n}</pre>\n<p>What does this mean? <code>ref</code> is internally a pointer&mdash;think <code>int* pArg</code>&mdash;but is used like a value in the source code. <code>arg = 5</code> works internally like <code>*pArg = 5</code>. Also, the client calls the function as if the argument were passed by value:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto anArray = [1,2];\nfun(anArray[1]); // or, via UFCS: anArray[1].fun;\n// anArray is now [1, 5]</pre>\n<p>instead of <code>fun(&amp;anArray[1])</code>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(C%2B%2B)">Unlike C++ references</a>, D <code>ref</code>erences can be <code>null</code>, but the application will instantly terminate with a segmentation fault if a null <code>ref</code> is used for something other than reading the address with the <code>&amp;</code> operator. So this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">int* ptr = null;\nfun(*ptr);</pre>\n<p>&#8230;compiles, but crashes at runtime because the assignment inside <code>fun</code> lands at the null address.</p>\n<p>The address of a <code>ref</code> variable is always guarded against escape. In this sense <code>@safe void fun(ref int arg){arg = 5;}</code> is like <code>@safe void fun(scope int* pArg){*pArg = 5;}</code>. For example, <code>@safe int* fun(ref int arg){return &amp;arg;}</code> will not compile, just like <code>@safe int* fun(scope int* pArg){return pArg;}</code> will not.</p>\n<p>There is a <code>return ref</code> storage class, however, that allows returning the address of the parameter but no other form of escape, just like <code>return scope</code>. This means that <code>@safe int* fun(return ref int arg){return &amp;arg;}</code> works.</p>\n<h3 id="referencetoareference"><code>ref</code>erence to a reference</h3>\n<p><code>ref</code>erence to an <code>int</code> or similar type already allows much nicer syntax than one can get with pointers. But the real power of <code>ref</code> shows when it refers to a type that is a reference itself&mdash;a pointer or a class, for instance. <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> can be applied to a reference that is referenced to by <code>ref</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe float[] mergeSort(ref return scope float[] arr)\n{\n    import std.algorithm: merge;\n    import std.array : Appender;\n\n    if(arr.length &lt; 2) return arr;\n\n    auto firstHalf = arr[0 .. $/2];\n    auto secondHalf = arr[$/2 .. $];\n\n    Appender!(float[]) output;\n    output.reserve(arr.length);\n\n    foreach\n    (\n        el;\n        firstHalf.mergeSort\n        .merge!floatLess(secondHalf.mergeSort)\n    )   output ~= el;\n\n    arr = output[];\n    return arr;\n}\n\n@safe bool floatLess(float a, float b)\n{\n    import std.math: isNaN;\n\n    return a.isNaN? false:\n          b.isNaN? true:\n          a&lt;b;\n}</pre>\n<p><code>mergeSort</code> here guarantees it won&#8217;t leak the address of the <code>float</code>s in <code>arr</code> except in the return value. This is the same guarantee that would be had from a <code>return scope float[] arr</code> parameter. But at the same time, because <code>arr</code> is a <code>ref</code> parameter, <code>mergeSort</code> can mutate the array passed to it. Then the client can write:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">float[] values = [5, 1.5, 0, 19, 1.5, 1];\nvalues.mergeSort;</pre>\n<p>With a non-<code>ref</code> argument, the client would have to write <code>values = values.sort</code> instead (not using <code>ref</code> would be a perfectly reasonable API in this case, because we do not always want to mutate the original array). This is something that cannot be accomplished with pointers, because <code>return scope float[]* arr</code> would protect the address of the array&#8217;s metadata (the <code>length</code> and <code>ptr</code> fields of the array), not the address of it&#8217;s contents.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to have a returnable <code>ref</code> argument to a <code>scope</code> reference. Since this example has a unit test, remember to use the <code>-unittest</code> compile flag to include it in the compiled binary.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe ref Exception nullify(return ref scope Exception obj)\n{\n    obj = null;\n    return obj;\n}\n\n@safe unittest\n{\n    scope obj = new Exception(&quot;Error!&quot;);\n    assert(obj.msg == &quot;Error!&quot;);\n    obj.nullify;\n    assert(obj is null);\n    // Since nullify returns by ref, we can assign\n    // to it\'s return value.\n    obj.nullify = new Exception(&quot;Fail!&quot;);\n    assert(obj.msg == &quot;Fail!&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<p>Here we return the address of the argument passed to <code>nullify</code>, but still guard both the address of the object pointer and the address of the class instance against being leaked by other channels.</p>\n<p><code>return</code> is a free keyword that does not mandate <code>ref</code> or <code>scope</code> to follow it. What does <code>void* fun(ref scope return int*)</code> mean then? <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#ref-return-scope-parameters">The spec states</a> that <code>return</code> without a trailing <code>scope</code> is always treated as <code>ref return</code>. This example thus is equivalent to <code>void* fun(return ref scope int*)</code>. However, this only applies if there is <code>ref</code>erence to bind to. Writing <code>void* fun(scope return int*)</code> means <code>void* fun(return scope int*)</code>. It&#8217;s even possible to write <code>void* fun(return int*)</code> with the latter meaning, but I leave it up to you to decide whether this qualifies as conciseness or obfuscation.</p>\n<h2 id="memberfunctionsandref">Member functions and <code>ref</code></h2>\n<p><code>ref</code> and <code>return ref</code> often require careful consideration to keep track of which address is protected and what can be returned. It takes some experience to get confortable with them. But once you do, understanding how <code>struct</code>s and <code>union</code>s work with DIP1000 is pretty straightforward.</p>\n<p>The major difference to classes is that where the <code>this</code> reference is just a regular class reference in class member functions, <code>this</code> in a struct or union member function is <code>ref StructOrUnionName</code>.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">union Uni\n{\n    int asInt;\n    char[4] asCharArr;\n\n    // Return value contains a reference to\n    // this union, won\'t escape references\n    // to it via any other channel\n    @safe char[] latterHalf() return\n    {\n        return asCharArr[2 .. $];\n    }\n\n    // This argument is implicitly ref, so the\n    // following means the return value does\n    // not refer to this union, and also that\n    // we don\'t leak it in any other way.\n    @safe char[] latterHalfCopy()\n    {\n        return latterHalf.dup;\n    }\n}</pre>\n<p>Note that <code>return ref</code> should not be used with the <code>this</code> argument. <code>char[] latterHalf() return ref</code> fails to parse. The language already has to understand what <code>ref char[] latterHalf() return</code> means: the return value is a <code>ref</code>erence. The &#8220;ref&#8221; in <code>return ref</code> would be redundant anyway.</p>\n<p>Note that we did not use the <code>scope</code> keyword here. <code>scope</code> would be meaningless with this union, because it does not contain references to anything. Just like it is meaningless to have a <code>scope ref int</code>, or a <code>scope int</code> function argument. <code>scope</code> makes sense only for types that refer to memory elsewhere.</p>\n<p><code>scope</code> in a <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> means the same thing as it means in a static array. It means that the memory its members refer to cannot be escaped. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct CString\n{\n    // We need to put the pointer in an anonymous\n    // union with a dummy member, otherwise @safe user\n    // code could assign ptr to point to a character\n    // not in a C string.\n    union\n    {\n        // Empty string literals get optimised to null pointers by D\n        // compiler, we have to do this for the .init value to really point to\n        // a \'\\0\'.\n        immutable(char)* ptr = &amp;nullChar;\n        size_t dummy;\n    }\n\n    // In constructors, the &quot;return value&quot; is the\n    // constructed data object. Thus, the return scope\n    // here makes sure this struct won\'t live longer\n    // than the memory in arr.\n    @trusted this(return scope string arr)\n    {\n        // Note: Normal assert would not do! They may be\n        // removed from release builds, but this assert\n        // is necessary for memory safety so we need\n        // to use assert(0) instead which never gets\n        // removed.\n        if(arr[$-1] != \'\\0\') assert(0, &quot;not a C string!&quot;);\n        ptr = arr.ptr;\n    }\n\n    // The return value refers to the same memory as the\n    // members in this struct, but we don\'t leak references\n    // to it via any other way, so return scope.\n    @trusted ref immutable(char) front() return scope\n    {\n        return *ptr;\n    }\n\n    // No references to the pointed-to array passed\n    // anywhere.\n    @trusted void popFront() scope\n    {\n        // Otherwise the user could pop past the\n        // end of the string and then read it!\n        if(empty) assert(0, &quot;out of bounds!&quot;);\n        ptr++;\n    }\n\n    // Same.\n    @safe bool empty() scope\n    {\n        return front == \'\\0\';\n    }\n}\n\nimmutable nullChar = \'\\0\';\n\n@safe unittest\n{\n    import std.array : staticArray;\n\n    auto localStr = &quot;hello world!\\0&quot;.staticArray;\n    auto localCStr = localStr.CString;\n    assert(localCStr.front == \'h\');\n\n    static immutable(char)* staticPtr;\n\n    // Error, escaping reference to local.\n    // staticPtr = &amp;localCStr.front();\n\n    // Fine.\n    staticPtr = &amp;CString(&quot;global\\0&quot;).front();\n\n    localCStr.popFront;\n    assert(localCStr.front == \'e\');\n    assert(!localCStr.empty);\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Part One said that <code>@trusted</code> is a terrible footgun with DIP1000. This example demonstrates why. Imagine how easy it&#8217;d be to use a regular assert or forget about them totally, or overlook the need to use the anonymous union. I <em>think</em> this struct is safe to use, but it&#8217;s entirely possible I overlooked something.</p>\n<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>\n<p>We almost know all there is to know about using structs, unions, and classes with DIP1000. We have two final things to learn today.</p>\n<p>But before that, a short digression regarding the <code>scope</code> keyword. It is not used for just annotating parameters and local variables as illustrated. It is also used for <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/class.html#auto">scope classes</a> and <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/statement.html#scope-guard-statement">scope guard statements</a>. This guide won&#8217;t be discussing those, because the former feature is deprecated, and the latter is not related to DIP1000 or control of variable lifetimes. The point of mentioning them is to dispel a potential misconception that <code>scope</code> always means limiting the lifetime of something. Learning about scope guard statements is still a good idea, as it&#8217;s a useful feature.</p>\n<p>Back to the topic. The first thing is not really specific to structs or classes. We discussed what <code>return</code>, <code>return ref</code>, and <code>return scope</code> usually mean, but there&#8217;s an alternative meaning to them. Consider:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void getFirstSpace\n(\n    ref scope string result,\n    return scope string where\n)\n{\n    //...\n}</pre>\n<p>The usual meaning of the <code>return</code> attribute makes no sense here, as the function has a <code>void</code> return type. A special rule applies in this case: if the return type is <code>void</code>, and the first argument is <code>ref</code> or <code>out</code>, any subsequent <code>return</code> [<code>ref</code>/<code>scope</code>] is assumed to be escaped by assigning to the first argument. With struct member functions, they are assumed to be assigned to the struct itself.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe unittest\n{\n    static string output;\n    immutable(char)[8] input = &quot;on stack&quot;;\n    //Trying to assign stack contents to a static\n    //variable. Won\'t compile.\n    getFirstSpace(output, input);\n}</pre>\n<p>Since <code>out</code> came up, it should be said it would be a better choice for <code>result</code> here than <code>ref</code>. <code>out</code> works like <code>ref</code>, with the one difference that the referenced data is automatically default-initialized at the beginning of the function, meaning any data to which the <code>out</code> parameter refers is guaranteed to not affect the function.</p>\n<p>The second thing to learn is that <code>scope</code> is used by the compiler to optimize class allocations inside function bodies. If a <code>new</code> class is used to initialize a <code>scope</code> variable, the compiler can put it on the stack. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">class C{int a, b, c;}\n@safe @nogc unittest\n{\n    // Since this unittest is @nogc, this wouldn\'t\n    // compile without the scope optimization.\n    scope C c = new C();\n}</pre>\n<p>This feature requires using the <code>scope</code> keyword explicitly. Inference of <code>scope</code> does not work, because initializing a class this way does not normally (meaning, without the <code>@nogc</code> attribute) mandate limiting the lifetime of <code>c</code>. The feature currently works only with classes, but there is no reason it couldn&#8217;t work with <code>new</code>ed struct pointers and array literals too.</p>\n<h3 id="untilnexttime">Until next time</h3>\n<p>This is pretty much all that there is to manual DIP1000 usage. But this blog series shall not be over yet! DIP1000 is not intended to always be used explicitly&mdash;it works with attribute inference. That&#8217;s what the next post will cover.</p>\n<p>It will also cover some considerations when daring to use <code>@trusted</code> and <code>@system</code> code. The need for dangerous systems programming exists and is part of the D language domain. But even systems programming is a responsible affair when people do what they can to minimize risks. We will see that even there it&#8217;s possible to do a lot.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Walter Bright and Dennis Korpel for reviewing this article</em></p>'}]}

D provides the <code>@safe</code> function attribute to verify that a function uses only memory-safe features of the language. For instance, try this.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe string getBeginning(immutable(char)* cString)\n{\n    return cString[0..3];\n}</pre>\n<p>The compiler will refuse to compile this code. There&#8217;s no way to know what will result from the three-character slice of <code>cString</code>, which could be referring to an empty string (i.e., <code>cString[0]</code> is <code>\\0</code>), a string with a length of <code>1</code>, or even one or two characters without the terminating NUL. The result in those cases would be a memory violation.</p>\n<h3 id="safedoesnotmeanslow"><code>@safe</code> does not mean slow</h3>\n<p>Note that I said above that even a low-level systems programming project should use <code>@safe</code> where practical. How is that possible, given that such projects sometimes cannot use the garbage collector, a major tool used in D to guarantee memory safety?</p>\n<p>Indeed, such projects must resort to memory-unsafe constructs every now and then. Even higher-level projects often have reasons to do so, as they want to create interfaces to C or C++ libraries, or avoid the garbage collector when indicated by runtime performance. But still, surprisingly large parts of code can be made <code>@safe</code> without using the garbage collector at all.</p>\n<p>D can do this because the memory safe subset does not prevent raw memory access per se.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void add(int* a, int* b, int* sum)\n{\n    *sum = *a + *b;\n}</pre>\n<p>This compiles and is fully memory safe, despite dereferencing those pointers in the same completely unchecked way they are dereferenced in C. This is memory safe because <code>@safe</code> D does not allow creating an <code>int*</code> that points to unallocated memory areas, or to a <code>float**</code>, for instance. <code>int*</code> can point to the null address, but this is generally not a memory safety problem because the null address is protected by the operating system. Any attempt to dereference it would crash the program before any memory corruption can happen. The garbage collector isn&#8217;t involved, because D&#8217;s GC can only run if more memory is requestend from it, or if the collection is explicitly called.</p>\n<p>D slices are similar. When indexed at runtime, they will check at runtime that the index is less than their length and that&#8217;s it. They will do no checking whatsoever on whether they are referring to a legal memory area. Memory safety is achieved by preventing creation of slices that could refer to illegal memory in the first place, as demonstrated in the first example of this article. And again, there&#8217;s no GC involved.</p>\n<p>This enables many patterns that are memory-safe, efficient, and independent of the garbage collector.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Struct\n{\n    int[] slice;\n    int* pointer;\n    int[10] staticArray;\n}\n\n@safe @nogc Struct examples(Struct arg)\n{\n    arg.slice[5] = *arg.pointer;\n    arg.staticArray[0..5] = arg.slice[5..10];\n    arg.pointer = &amp;arg.slice[8];\n    return arg;\n}</pre>\n<p>As demonstrated, D liberally lets one do unchecked memory handling in <code>@safe</code> code. The memory referred to by <code>arg.slice</code> and <code>arg.pointer</code> may be on the garbage collected heap, or it may be in the static program memory. There is no reason the language needs to care. The program will probably need to either call the garbage collector or do some unsafe memory management to allocate memory for the pointer and the slice, but handling already allocated memory does not need to do either. If this function needed the garbage collector, it would fail to compile because of the <code>@nogc</code> attribute.</p>\n<h3 id="however...">However&#8230;</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s a historical design flaw here in that the memory may also be on the stack. Consider what happens if we change our function a bit.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe @nogc Struct examples(Struct arg)\n{\n    arg.pointer = &amp;arg.staticArray[8];\n    arg.slice = arg.staticArray[0..8];\n    return arg;\n}</pre>\n<p><code>Struct arg</code> is a value type. Its contents are copied to the stack when <code>examples</code> is called and can be ovewritten after the function returns. <code>staticArray</code> is also a value type. It&#8217;s copied along with the rest of the struct just as if there were ten integers in the struct instead. When we return <code>arg</code>, the contents of <code>staticArray</code> are copied to the return value, but <code>ptr</code> and <code>slice</code> continue to point to <code>arg</code>, not the returned copy!</p>\n<p>But we have a fix. It allows one to write code just as performant in <code>@safe</code> functions as before, including references to the stack. It even enables a few formerly <code>@system</code> (the opposite of <code>@safe</code>) tricks to be written in a safe way. That fix is DIP1000. It&#8217;s the reason why this example already causes a deprecation warning by default if it&#8217;s compiled with the latest nightly dmd.</p>\n<h2 id="bornfirstdeadlast">Born first, dead last</h2>\n<p>DIP1000 is a set of enhancements to the language rules regarding pointers, slices, and other references. The name stands for <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs">D Improvement Proposal</a> number 1000, <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/other/DIP1000.md">as that document is what</a> the new rules were initially based on. One can enable the new rules with the preview compiler switch, <code>-preview=dip1000</code>. Existing code may need some changes to work with the new rules, which is why the switch is not enabled by default. It&#8217;s going to be the default in the future, so it&#8217;s best to enable it where possible and work to make code compatible with it where not.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is to let people limit the lifetime of a reference (an array or pointer, for example). A pointer to the stack is not dangerous if it does not exist longer than the stack variable it is pointing to. Regular references continue to exist, but they can refer only to data with an unlimited lifetime&mdash;that is, garbage collected memory, or <code>static</code> or global variables.</p>\n<h3 id="letsgetstarted">Let&#8217;s get started</h3>\n<p>The simplest way to construct limited lifetime references is to assign to it something with a limited lifetime.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int* test(int arg1, int arg2)\n{\n    int* notScope = new int(5);\n    int* thisIsScope = &amp;arg1;\n    int* alsoScope; // Not initially scope...\n    alsoScope = thisIsScope; // ...but this makes it so.\n\n    // Error! The variable declared earlier is\n    // considered to have a longer lifetime,\n    // so disallowed.\n    thisIsScope = alsoScope;\n\n    return notScope; // ok\n    return thisIsScope; // error\n    return alsoScope; // error\n}</pre>\n<p>When testing these examples, remember to use the compiler switch <code>-preview=dip1000</code> and to mark the function <code>@safe</code>. The checks are not done for non-<code>@safe</code> functions.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/attribute.html#scope">the <code>scope</code> keyword</a> can be explicitly used to limit the lifetime of a reference.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int[] test()\n{\n    int[] normalRef;\n    scope int[] limitedRef;\n\n    if(true)\n    {\n        int[5] stackData = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5];\n\n        // Lifetime of stackData ends\n        // before limitedRef, so this is\n        // disallowed.\n        limitedRef = stackData[];\n\n        //This is how you do it\n        scope int[] evenMoreLimited\n            = stackData[];\n    }\n\n    return normalRef; // Okay.\n    return limitedRef; // Forbidden.\n}</pre>\n<p>If we can&#8217;t return limited lifetime references, how they are used at all? Easy. Remember, only the address of the data is protected, not the data itself. It means that we have many ways to pass scoped data out of the function.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int[] fun()\n{\n    scope int[] dontReturnMe = [1,2,3];\n\n    int[] result = new int[](dontReturnMe.length);\n    // This copies the data, instead of having\n    // result refer to protected memory.\n    result[] = dontReturnMe[];\n    return result;\n\n    // Shorthand way of doing the same as above\n    return dontReturnMe.dup;\n\n    // Also you are not always interested\n    // in the contents as a whole; you\n    // might want to calculate something else\n    // from them\n    return\n    [\n        dontReturnMe[0] * dontReturnMe[1],\n        cast(int) dontReturnMe.length\n    ];\n}</pre>\n<h3 id="gettinginterprocedural">Getting interprocedural</h3>\n<p>With the tricks discussed so far, DIP1000 would be restricted to language primitives when handling limited lifetime references, but the <code>scope</code> storage class can be applied to function parameters, too. Because this guarantees the memory won&#8217;t be used after the function exits, local data references can be used as arguments to <code>scope</code> parameters.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe double average(scope int[] data)\n{\n    double result = 0;\n    foreach(el; data) result += el;\n    return result / data.length;\n}\n\n@safe double use()\n{\n    int[10] data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];\n    return data[].average; // works!\n}</pre>\n<p>Initially, it&#8217;s probably best to keep <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#function-attribute-inference">attribute auto inference</a> off. Auto inference in general is a good tool, but it silently adds <code>scope</code> attributes to all parameters it can, meaning it&#8217;s easy to lose track of what&#8217;s happening. That makes the learning process a lot harder. Avoid this by always explicitly specifying the return type (or lack thereof with <code>void</code> or <code>noreturn</code>): <code>@safe const(char[]) fun(int* val)</code> as opposed to <code>@safe auto fun(int* val)</code> or <code>@safe const fun(int* val)</code>. The function also must not be a template or inside a template. We&#8217;ll dig deeper on <code>scope</code> auto inference in a future post.</p>\n<p><code>scope</code> allows handling pointers and arrays that point to the stack, but forbids returning them. What if that&#8217;s the goal? Enter the <code>return scope</code> attribute:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">//Being character arrays, strings also work with DIP1000.\n@safe string latterHalf(return scope string arg)\n{\n    return arg[$/2 .. $];\n}\n\n@safe string test()\n{\n    // allocated in static program memory\n    auto hello1 = "Hello world!";\n    // allocated on the stack, copied from hello1\n    immutable(char)[12] hello2 = hello1;\n\n    auto result1 = hello1.latterHalf; // ok\n    return result1; // ok\n\n    auto result2 = hello2[].latterHalf; // ok\n    // Nice try! result2 is scope and can\'t\n    // be returned.\n    return result2;\n}</pre>\n<p><code>return scope</code> parameters work by checking if any of the arguments passed to them are <code>scope</code>. If so, the return value is treated as a <code>scope</code> value that may not outlive any of the <code>return scope</code> arguments. If none are <code>scope</code>, the return value is treated as a global reference that can be copied freely. Like <code>scope</code>, <code>return scope</code> is conservative. Even if one does not actually return the address protected by <code>return scope</code>, the compiler will still perform the call site lifetime checks just as if one did.</p>\n<h3 id="scopeisshallow"><code>scope</code> is shallow</h3>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void test()\n{\n    scope a = "first";\n    scope b = "second";\n    string[] arr = [a, b];\n}</pre>\n<p>In <code>test</code>, initializing <code>arr</code> does not compile. This may be surprising given that the language automatically adds <code>scope</code> to a variable on initialization if needed.</p>\n<p>However, consider what the <code>scope</code> on <code>scope string[] arr</code> would protect. There are two things it could potentially protect: the addresses of the strings in the array, or the addresses of the characters in the strings. For this assignment to be safe, <code>scope</code> would have to protect the characters in the strings, but it only protects the top-level reference, i.e., the strings in the array. Thus, the example does not work. Now change <code>arr</code> so that it&#8217;s a static array:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void test()\n{\n    scope a = "first";\n    scope b = "second";\n    string[2] arr = [a, b];\n}</pre>\n<p>This works because static arrays are not references. Memory for all of their elements is allocated in place on the stack (i.e., they <em>contain</em> their elements), as opposed to dynamic arrays which contain a reference to elements stored elsewhere. When a static array is <code>scope</code>, its elements are treated as <code>scope</code>. And since the example would not compile were <code>arr</code> not <code>scope</code>, it follows that <code>scope</code> is inferred.</p>\n<h2 id="somepracticaltips">Some practical tips</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it, the DIP1000 rules take time to understand, and many would rather spend that time coding something useful. The first and most important tip is: avoid non-<code>@safe</code> code like the plague if doable. Of course, this advice is not new, but it appears even more important with DIP1000. In a nutshell, the language does not check the validity of <code>scope</code> and <code>return scope</code> in a non-<code>@safe</code> function, <em>but</em> when calling those functions the compiler assumes that the attributes are respected.</p>\n<p>This makes <code>scope</code> and <code>return scope</code> terrible footguns in unsafe code. But by resisting the temptation to mark code <code>@trusted</code> to avoid thinking, a D coder can hardly do damage. Misusing DIP1000 in <code>@safe</code> code can cause needless compilation errors, but it won&#8217;t corrupt memory and is unlikely to cause other bugs either.</p>\n<p>A second important point worth mentioning is that there is no need for <code>scope</code> and <code>return scope</code> for function attributes if they receive only static or GC-allocated data. Many langauges do not let coders refer to the stack at all; just because D programmers can do so does not mean they must. This way, they don&#8217;t have to spend any more time solving compiler errors than they did before DIP1000. And if a desire to work with the stack arises after all, the authors can then return to annotate the functions. Most likely they will accomplish this without breaking the interface.</p>\n<h2 id="whatsnext">What&#8217;s next?</h2>\n<p>This concludes today&#8217;s blog post. This is enough to know how to use arrays and pointers with DIP1000. In principle, it also enables readers to use DIP1000 with classes and interfaces. The only thing to learn is that a class reference, including the <code>this</code> pointer in member functions, works with DIP1000 just like a pointer would. Still, it&#8217;s hard to grasp what that means from one sentence, so later posts shall illustrate the subject.</p>\n<p>In any case, there is more to know. DIP1000 has some features for <code>ref</code> function parameters, structs, and unions that we didn&#8217;t cover here. We&#8217;ll also dig deeper on how DIP1000 plays with non-<code>@safe</code> functions and attribute auto inference. Currently, the plan is to do two more posts for this series.</p>\n<p>Do let us know in the comment section or the D forums if you have any useful DIP1000 tips that were not covered!</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Walter Bright for reviewing this article.</em></p>'}]}

Finally, the latter half of the month saw <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#schedule">the publication of the DConf &#8217;22 schedule</a>, we found a sponsor for the DConf tradition of BeerConf, and May 31st marks <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#register">the final day of DConf &#8217;22 early-bird registration</a>.</p>\n<p><em>A video version of this blog post is available on <a href="https://youtu.be/qTH1S6z-n-s">the D Language Foundation YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id="d2.100.0">D 2.100.0</h2>\n<p><a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html">This latest release of DMD</a> comes to us courtesy of 41 contributors who brought us 22 major changes and 179 fixed Bugzilla issues. Although the community attached a bit of significance to the 2.100.0 version number, there isn&#8217;t anything overly exciting in the changelog. This is largely a house-cleaning release&mdash;a number of deprecation periods that should have already ended have been terminated&mdash; but there are a couple of interesting additions to the language.</p>\n<h3 id="d1-styleopertatoroverloading">D1-style operator overloading</h3>\n<p>One of these is <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html#d1_style_operators">the deprecation of D1-style operator overloads</a>. Originally, these were designed to make their purpose clear. Want to overload the addition operator? Then implement <code>opAdd</code>. What to overload the multiplication operator? Then implement <code>opMul</code>. Walter took this approach with operator overloading because of one of the major complaints about the feature in C++: people often overload an operator to do something different from what it is expected to do. An example: overloading the <code>+</code> operator to append rather than perform addition. Walter&#8217;s reasoning was that if the intent of the operator is included in the name of the function, then anyone overloading it to do something different is essentially violating its contract. Perhaps it would encourage people to stick to the intent.</p>\n<p>No one can say for sure if Walter&#8217;s approach worked like he hoped, but <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/operatoroverloading.html">a more generic design was implemented in D2</a>, and this is the approach all D code must use today. The D1 operators were kept around largely to ease porting D1 code to D2, with the intention that they would one day be deprecated. <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.088.0.html">It finally happened in D 2.088.0</a>, which was released in the fall of 2019. <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/accepted/DIP1013.md">Following the deprecation process</a>, the deprecation period should have ended with 2.098.0 (the first release after 10 non-patch releases including the deprecation).</p>\n<h3 id="delete">delete</h3>\n<p>The <code>delete</code> keyword was another D1 feature that was ultimately axed in D2. It <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.079.0.html">was deprecated in D 2.079.0</a>, which was released in the spring of 2018. This was something that had long been planned (<a href="https://dlang.org/deprecate.html#delete">see the deprecation page for the rationale</a>), and its use had been discouraged for some time.</p>\n<p>N<code>delete</code> would both destroy an object instance (call its destructors) and release the memory allocated for it by the GC. Now, we use the <code>destroy</code> function from the <code>object</code> module which is imported by default in all D programs. This will call the destructor on an instance and optionally reset the instance to its default <code>.init</code> state. The GC will then free the memory allocated for the instance when necessary, or the programmer can do it manually via <code>GC.free</code> static member function in <code>core.memory</code>.</p>\n<h3 id="mustuse">@mustuse</h3>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/accepted/DIP1038.md">Paul Backus took DIP 1038</a> through the review process from beginning to end. Initially, it introduced an <code>@nodiscard</code> attribute for functions and types. During the Formal Assessment after the review rounds were completed, Walter and Átila were willing to approve it with changes. The final version renamed the attribute to <code>@mustUse</code> and restricted its application to structs and unions.</p>\n<p><a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html#mustUse">The feature was implemented in D 2.100.0</a> as <code>@mustuse</code>, and is now available to use in your D code. When a type marked with the attribute is the result of an expression, the result cannot be ignored.</p>\n<h3 id=".tupleofforstaticarrays">.tupleof for static arrays</h3>\n<p>Many D programmers are familiar with the <code>.tupleof</code> property of structs, which is particularly useful when interfacing with C libraries:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Circle {\n    float x, y;\n    float radius;\n    ubyte r, g, b, a;\n}\n\n@nogc nothrow\nextern(C) void draw_circle (\n    float cx, float cy, float radius,\n    ubyte r, ubyte g, ubyte b, ubyte a\n);\n\nvoid foo() {\n    Circle c = makeCircle();\n    draw_circle(c.tupleof);\n}</pre>\n<p>Now we can <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html#static_array_tupleof">do the same thing with static arrays</a>:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void foo(int, int, int) { /* ... */ }\n\nint[3] ia = [1, 2, 3];\nfoo(ia.tupleof); // same as `foo(1, 2, 3);\n\nfloat[3] fa;\n//fa = ia; // error\nfa.tupleof = ia.tupleof;\nassert(fa == [1F, 2F, 3F]);</pre>\n<h2 id="dconf22">DConf &#8217;22</h2>\n<p>DConf &#8217;22 is happening in London, August 1&nbsp;4.

One of the talks on Day 3 is slated for 25&#8211;30 minutes, so we&#8217;ve slotted it such that we have a longer lunch that day.</p>\n<p>The schedule (excluding the keynotes, as the details of those haven&#8217;t yet been provided) has a loose theme. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;ll do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Day One is mostly status reports and tutorials</li>\n<li>Day Two is largely intermediate to advanced and heavy on the tech</li>\n<li>Day Three is about the D ecosystem</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the talks will be livestreamed and recorded, so they&#8217;ll be available on our YouTube channel at some point after the conference has ended. Still, DConf is about more than just the talks, <a href="https://youtu.be/nvo7wzjVDQc">as Razvan Nitu and Dennis Korpel noted in an interview</a>.

Every year, we would designate an &#8220;official&#8221; hotel somewhere in the vicinity of the venue. This would be our gathering spot in the evenings, usually in the hotel lobby or bar. Typically, would people break off into groups for dinner, then several of them would wander over to the gathering spot to hang out and chat, usually over beers. At DConf 2017, Ethan Watson branded this gathering BeerConf and the name has stuck.</p>\n<p>At DConf 2019 in London, we couldn&#8217;t find a suitable hotel to select as the site of BeerConf. Instead, we hired out the upper floor of a pub close to the venue, thanks to the sponsorship of Mercedes Benz Research and Development North America. For DConf &#8217;22, we&#8217;re back in the same general area, and so we again have to hire out a pub.</p>\n<p>The 2019 pub was a bit crowded for us, and is a bit too far of a walk from our &#8217;22 venue, so we&#8217;ve got our eyes on another pub within walking distance of the venue and near <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#venue">some of the budget hotels listed at dconf.org</a>. What we&#8217;ve been missing is funding.</p>\n<p>That has changed, <a href="https://funkwerk.com/en/?noredirect=en-US">thanks to Funkwerk</a>! With their sponsorship, we&#8217;re able to cover the minimum spend the pub asks for the each of the evenings of August 1&nbsp;3. This means that DConf attendees dropping by this pub on those nights can order food and drinks (alcoholic and or otherwise) for free until the DConf tab runs out. We&#8217;ll have a separate tab for each night so that we don&#8217;t blow it all in one go.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t announce the specifics about the pub just yet. <a href="https://symmetryinvestments.com/">Our DConf host, Symmetry Investments</a>, is handling the arrangements for us since they&#8217;re in London and we aren&#8217;t. Once I receive confirmation that the deal is set, I&#8217;ll announce all of the details in the forums, here on the blog, and at dconf.org. So keep your ears open!</p>\n<p>Thanks again to Funkwerk for helping us out.</p>\n<h2 id="nexttime">Next time</h2>\n<p>The next big news roundup will come in late August or early September, but I&#8217;ll keep the blog updated with announcements before DConf as they come. If you are planning to attend DConf, then I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing you in London. And if you aren&#8217;t, then change your plans!</p>'}]}

Three of them were unable to make it to the end. So it came down to two: Teodor Dutu and Luís Ferreira. Teodor was working on converting DRuntime hooks to templates, and Luís on getting support for D into LLDB, the LLVM debugger.</p>\n<p>SAOC is sponsored by Symmetry Investments. Each year, participants promise to work on their projects at least 20 hours per week across four month-long milestones. At the end of each of the first three milestones, a panel of judges evaluates their progress to decide if they pass or fail. A passing participant is awarded a $1000 payment and allowed to continue in the next milestone. A failing participant might be given a reduced payment or none at all, and removed from the event or given a warning, depending on the circumstances leading to the failure. At the end of the fourth milestone, the judges evaluate the overall progress of each participant across the entire event and select one to receive a final $1000 payment and a free trip to DConf.</p>\n<p>For the first time in four editions of the event, the SOAC 2021 judges were unable to agree on who should receive the final rewards. It was a three-judge panel, each of whom is a veteran of every edition of SAOC: Jon Colvin, Átila Neves, and Robert Schadek. Two of them split, and the third felt there wasn&#8217;t enough to make either of the two participants stand out above the other. Teodor and Luís both did their work, wrote detailed milestone reports, and kept up with their forum updates to the same degree. So the conflicted judge took a proposal to Laeeth Isharc of Symmetry: why not award both candidates the final payment and the DConf trip?</p>\n<p>Congratulations to Teodor and Luís on being the first dual recipients of the final SAOC reward. They have continued working on their projects, and we look forward to seeing the work they do in the future. Thanks to all of the SAOC participants, mentors, and judges, and to Symmetry Investments for sponsoring the event every year.</p>\n<h2 id="thenewpullrequestandissuemanager">The New Pull Request and Issue Manager</h2>\n<p>For over a year, Razvan Nitu has been working hard at closing Bugzilla issues and merging pull requests in his role as our Pull Request and Issue Manager. His position is sponsored by Symmetry Investments, which provided funding for two such positions. Unfortunately, real-world circumstances conspired to prevent the person selected for the second position from filling it, so it remained vacant through most of 2021.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of this year, Symmetry committed to continuing funding for both positions (as well as a different position, that of my assistant, filled by Max Haughton). In January, we put out a call for applications. In February, we announced that Dennis Korpel was selected for the job. His proven track record as a volunteer contributor to the core D repositories made him the top contender.</p>\n<p>Dennis officially started his new job on March 1, and he hit the ground running. We&#8217;re happy to have him on board.</p>\n<h3 id="tellthemaboutit--dbugfix">Tell them about it&#8211;#dbugfix</h3>\n<p>Razvan and Dennis are here to make sure the bugs are fixed and pull requests are merged. If you have an issue that&#8217;s bugging you because it&#8217;s been open for ages, or if you feel like a pull request should be getting more attention, let them know! That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re here for.</p>\n<p>One way you can do that is by tweeting the issue number along with <strong>#dbugfix</strong>. We initiated this hashtag a while back so that D users could bring attention to specific issues, but then the hard part was finding someone with the time and inclination to fix it. Now, with both Razvan and Dennis paid to make sure issues get fixed, the hard part is a lot easier. You can also post about issues in the forums or email social@dlang.org, and I will make sure that they see it.</p>\n<p>Razvan and Dennis have their criteria for deciding their priorities in the absence of input, but if you bring an issue or PR to their attention, they will work to resolve it as quickly as they can.</p>\n<h2 id="d2.099.0">D 2.099.0</h2>\n<p>Version 2.099.0 of DMD, the reference D compiler, was released on March 6. This is a <em>massive</em> release, containing 20 major changes and 221 closed Bugzilla issues from 100 contributors. Some highlights from this release: D modules can be imported into C code via ImportC; D now has <em>throw expressions</em>; and PE/COFF output is now the default in DMD on Windows. <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.099.0.html">See the changelog</a> for the complete list.</p>\n<h3 id="importmodulesincsourcecodewithimportc">Import modules in C source code with ImportC</h3>\n<p>ImportC is proving to be a valuable addition to D. Once all the kinks are ironed out and a solution for handling C preprocessor directives is implemented, the need for bindings to C libraries will largely disappear&mdash;you&#8217;ll be able to bring C headers, and compile C source files, directly into your D programs without any external tools.</p>\n<p>As of D 2.099.0, you can also <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.099.0.html#__import">bring D modules directly into C files</a> via the <code>__import</code> keyword.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// dsayhello.d\nimport core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nextern(C) void helloImport() {\n    puts(&quot;Hello __import!&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">// dhelloimport.c\n__import dsayhello;\n__import core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    helloImport();\n    puts(&quot;Cool, eh?&quot;);\n    return 0;\n}</pre>\n<p>Compile with:</p>\n<pre>dmd dhelloimport.c dsayhello.d</pre>\n<p>You can also use it to import C modules that have been compiled via ImportC:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">// csayhello.c\n__import core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nvoid helloImport() {\n    puts(&quot;Hello _import!&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">// chelloimport.c\n__import csayhello;\n__import core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    helloImport();\n    puts(&quot;Cool, eh?&quot;);\n    return 0;\n}</pre>\n<p>Compile with:</p>\n<pre>dmd chelloimport.c csayhello.c</pre>\n<h3 id="thethrowexpressionhasbeenimplemented">The throw expression has been implemented</h3>\n<p>For all of D&#8217;s lifetime, <code>throw</code> has been a statement and only a statement. It couldn&#8217;t be used in expressions because expressions must have a type, and since <code>throw</code> doesn&#8217;t return a value, there was no suitable type. This prevented it from being used with the following syntax:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">(string err) =&gt; throw new Exception(err);</pre>\n<p>And required this form instead:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">(string err) { throw new Exception(err); }</pre>\n<p>DIP 1034, which introduced a bottom type to the language, <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/accepted/DIP1034.md#flow-analysis-across-functions">provided the means to enable throw expressions</a>: when &#8220;a throw statement is seen as an expression returning a bottom type&#8221;. As of D 2.099.0, <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/expression.html#throw_expression">the following code snippet compiles</a>:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void foo(int function() f) {}\n\nvoid main() {\n    foo(() =&gt; throw new Exception());\n}</pre>\n<h3 id="pecoffisthedefaultdmdoutputonwindows">PE/COFF is the default DMD output on Windows</h3>\n<p>For many years, DMD outputs object files in the OMF format on Windows. There&#8217;s a story behind this, a large part of it related to the culture of software development on Windows, but it can be summarized in two bullet points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Walter Bright already had a C compiler backend that generated OMF output, a license to distribute OMF link libraries for the Win32 API, and a linker that understands OMF (OPTLINK).</li>\n<li>There was no de facto system linker on Windows when he started working on D in 1999, so he could not rely on a specific linker being installed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reusing the compiler backend and the linker allowed Walter to distribute DMD as a compiler that worked out of the box, without the need to install any further development tools. He felt this was important for D&#8217;s early adoption. The downside was that it also restricted DMD on Windows to 32-bit. Eventually, he had to support PE/COFF and require the Microsoft linker in order to support 64-bit output, and he implemented PE/COFF 32-bit at the same time, but he was adamant that DMD continue to work out of the box for those who didn&#8217;t want to install the Microsoft Build Tools (for the linker) and Windows SDK (for the Win32 link libraries).</p>\n<p>Eventually, OPTLINK started showing its age. Linker errors became more common as D codebases grew. There were calls to enable PE/COFF by default. Finally, someone raised the idea of shipping <a href="https://lld.llvm.org/">the LLVM linker, LLD</a>, along with link libraries generated from <a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">the MinGW project</a>. This would allow DMD to eventually default to PE/COFF while maintaining the out-of-the-box experience.</p>\n<p>DMD has been shipping with LLD for several releases, and it seems enough of the kinks have been worked out that it has been ready to become the default for a while now. Nicholas Wilson finally took the step to make that happen, Walter eventually gave it his blessing, and now PE/COFF is the default DMD output on Windows.</p>\n<p>Practically, this means that the <code>-m32mscoff</code> switch has been deprecated, <code>-m32</code> now specifies PE/COFF, and the new switch <code>-m32omf</code> can be used to produce OMF output if needed (but its OMF support will eventually be dropped). The <code>-m64</code> switch has always produced PE/COFF output, so has not changed.</p>\n<h3 id="ldc">LDC</h3>\n<p>The beta release of LDC 1.29.0 <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/post/tgvvhqvyugfrsdhuhiyo@forum.dlang.org">was announced on March 10</a>. This version of the LLVM-based D compiler is based on D 2.099.0+. It includes support for LLVM 13, no longer defaults to the <code>ld.gold</code> linker on Linux (LLD is recommended), and includes a breaking change for the <code>extern(D)</code> ABI. See <a href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases/tag/v1.29.0-beta1">the full release log for details</a>.</p>\n<h2 id="dconf22inlondon">DConf &#8217;22 in London</h2>\n<p>After an unexpected and unwanted hiatus, DConf is returning to the real world! Hosted once again by Symmetry Investments, <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html">we&#8217;ll be in London, Aug 1&ndash;4, 2022</a>. We&#8217;re currently accepting submissions and early-bird registration is open.</p>\n<h3 id="guestkeynotespeaker">Guest keynote speaker</h3>\n<p>Our guest speaker this year is Roberto Ierusalimschy, Associate Professor at the PUC-Rio Department of Informatics and head designer of the Lua programming language. We&#8217;re excited that he&#8217;s able to join us. Several D community members have used or are using Lua in their D projects, including the gas dynamics toolkit at the University of Queensland that <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/2022/02/02/a-gas-dynamics-toolkit-in-d/">its maintainers wrote about on this blog</a>. (You can also count me in that group. I&#8217;ve used Lua in different capacities over the years, and I maintain <a href="https://github.com/BindBC/bindbc-lua">a set of D bindings for Lua&#8217;s C API</a>).</p>\n<p>Roberto was the mentor who shepherded the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386323#:~:text=The%20D%20programming%20language%20began,development%20and%20maintenance%20since%201982.">Origins of the D Programming Language</a> paper <a href="https://hopl4.sigplan.org/">through the HOPL IV conference</a>, so he already has a connection to the D community.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know yet if his talk will be related to Lua, but I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing what he has to say.</p>\n<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>\n<p>Early-bird registration is open until May 31. The base early-bird rate is $352.75 ($423.30 after applying 20% VAT), which is 15% off the general registration of $415 ($498 with 20% VAT). We offer a student discount, a discount for major open source contributors, and a hardship rate. You can <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#register">register now or learn about the discounted rates at dconf.org</a>.</p>\n<h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>\n<p>At past editions of DConf, we&#8217;ve allotted talks in 50-minute blocks with 10-minute breaks in between. This year, we&#8217;re cutting that down: we&#8217;d like to keep the talks no longer than 40&ndash;45 minutes. Part of the magic of DConf is the time spent interacting face-to-face with other D enthusiasts, so it only makes sense to make as much room for that as we can while still allowing for educational and informative presentations.</p>\n<p>If you have something related to the D programming language that you&#8217;d like to share with the world, please send in a submission. Don&#8217;t know what to talk about? Then heed Ali Çehreli, <a href="https://youtu.be/E-78QqeDfI8?t=21">from one of his DConf Online 2020 Q &amp; A sessions</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nComing up with an idea for a talk is as simple as the way you use D. Just look at your code, and it makes a presentation&#8230;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you have used the D programming language, then you have material for a talk: describe your project; talk about specific problems you solved or interesting ways in which you&#8217;ve employed language features; expound on the ups and downs of your experience learning D so that others can benefit; and so on. Take a look at the DConf and DConf Online talks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDLanguageFoundation/playlists">available on our YouTube channel</a> for inspiration. Even if you&#8217;ve never presented at a conference, we encourage you to send us a submission! Several D community members have given their first presentation at DConf, and we are always happy to see more.</p>\n<p>The worst that can happen when you submit a talk is that it isn&#8217;t accepted. But if it <em>is</em> accepted, then you&#8217;ll be entitled to reimbursement for your transportation to and from London, and your lodging for the five nights of the conference. You get to hang out with people who share your interest in D and most of your expenses are covered, with nothing to lose if your talk isn&#8217;t accepted.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let doubt or hesitation hold you back. You can <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#schedule">find submission details at dconf.org</a>.</p>\n<h3 id="venue">Venue</h3>\n<p>DConf &#8217;22 is taking place <a href="https://www.codenode.live/">a nifty venue between Moorgate and Liverpool Street Stations called CodeNode</a>. All of our talks will be in their CTRL room on the first floor, and we&#8217;ll have the basement ESC room to ourselves for mingling between talks and during lunch. They have table tennis and foosball tables, and plenty of space in which to chill.</p>\n<p>CodeNode isn&#8217;t far from our DConf 2019 venue, so the same budget hotels we stayed at then are also within walking distance this year. You can find a list of <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#venue">those and several other budget hotels in the area at dconf.org</a>.</p>\n<h3 id="beerconf">BeerConf!</h3>\n<p>For every edition of DConf before 2019, we designated one area hotel as the official gathering spot. Many attendees would take rooms there, and a number of us would gather in the evenings in the hotel lobby or bar to chat over drinks and snacks. In one of our Berlin editions, Ethan Watson coined the term &#8220;BeerConf&#8221; to refer to these evening meetups. In 2019, we couldn&#8217;t find a suitable hotel in which to gather, so we hired space in a pub near the venue. When DConf was canceled in 2020, a couple of community members hosted an online BeerConf to make up for the loss of the real-world version, and <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Beerconf">they&#8217;ve been hosting it every month since</a>.</p>\n<p>This year, since we&#8217;re back in the same part of London, we&#8217;re again looking for a space we can rent for BeerConf. We&#8217;ve got our eyes on a couple of spaces, and we&#8217;re working to secure funding. I hope to have an update on that before the end of April.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, keep an eye on <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/group/announce">the D Announce forum</a> for news of our monthly online version of BeerConf, and consider picking up a BeerConf shirt from <a href="https://www.zazzle.com/store/dlang_swag?rf=238129799288374326">our DLang Swag Emporium</a>!</p>\n<h2 id="lookingahead">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to the rest of 2022. One of our big goals for this year is to lay the groundwork for bringing more structure and organization to the D ecosystem. The PR/Issue managers have made a big difference and brought order to a chaotic contribution process, but we still have a long way to get to where we&#8217;d like to be.</p>\n<p>Soon, I&#8217;ll start publishing tutorials on the foundation&#8217;s YouTube channel. These tutorials are going to cover more than just the language syntax and semantics. They&#8217;ll also dive into the tools we use as D programmers: compilers, linkers, loaders, object files, etc. These days, it&#8217;s not unsual for a programmer new to D to have gone years without ever touching a programming language that uses the same compile-link model. Questions about static linking errors, or confusion about compiler vs. linker errors, are not uncommon. These tutorials will be short and focused on specific topics, and will hopefully serve as a means for new D programmers to up their game with the tools they use.</p>\n<p>Once I&#8217;ve uploaded the tutorials, I&#8217;ll apply for our channel to join the YouTube Partner Program so that we can start raising money from the channel. We&#8217;re eligible now, but I don&#8217;t want to apply until I&#8217;ve established a more frequent pattern of updates.</p>\n<p>On that note, I&#8217;d like to remind you that the D Language Foundation is available to select as a charity for the Amazon Smile program.

They allow the programmer to generate efficient and correct code at compile time. Long gone are the days of preprocessor macros or handwritten, per-type data structures. D templates, though designed in the shadow of C++ templates, were not made in their image. D makes templates cleaner and more expressive, and also enables patterns like &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdzwvY8Mo-w">Design by Introspection</a>&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Here is a simple example of a template that would require the use of preprocessor macros in C or C++:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template sizeOfTypeByName(string name)\n{\n  enum sizeOfTypeByName = mixin(name, ".sizeof");\n}\nunittest\n{\n  assert(sizeOfTypeByName!"int" == 4);\n}</pre>\n<p>D&#8217;s templates are powerful tools but should not be used unthinkingly. Carelessness could result in long compile times or excessive code generation.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I introduce some simple concepts that can help in writing templates that minimize resource usage. Deeper intuition can also lead to the discovery of new abstractions or increased confidence in existing ones.</p>\n<h2 id="readthememo">Read the memo</h2>\n<p>The D compiler memoizes template instantiations: if I instantiate <code>MyTemplate!int</code> once, the compiler produces an AST for that instantiation; if I instantiate that exact template again, the previous computation is reused.</p>\n<p>As a demonstration, let&#8217;s write a generic addition function and use <code>pragma(msg, ...)</code> to print the number of instantiations at compile time. I&#8217;m going to use it twice with integers and twice with floating point numbers.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto genericAdd(T)(const T x, const T y)\n{\n  pragma(msg, "genericAdd instantiated with ", T);\n  return x + y;\n}\n\n// Instantiate with int\nwriteln(genericAdd!int(4, 5));\nwriteln(genericAdd!int(6, 1));\n\n// Now for the float type\nwriteln(genericAdd!float(24.0, 32.0));\nwriteln(genericAdd!float(0.0, float.nan));</pre>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s compile the code and look at what our <code>pragma(msg, )</code> says about template instantiations in the compiler.</p>\n<pre>dmd -c generic_add.d</pre>\n<p>This yields the following output during compilation:</p>\n<pre>genericAdd instantiated with int\ngenericAdd instantiated with float</pre>\n<p>We can see <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> as we expected, but notice that each is only mentioned once. Newcomers to languages with templates or generics can sometimes mistakenly think that using a template requires a potentially expensive instantiation on every use in the source code. For the benefit of those new users of D, the above is categoric proof that this is not the case; you <em>cannot</em> pay twice for templates you have already asked the compiler to instantiate. (You can, however, convince yourself that you <em>are</em> asking the compiler to do something it&#8217;s already done when you in fact are not. We&#8217;ll go over contrived and real-world examples of this later in this article.)</p>\n<p>The benefit of this feature should be obvious, but what may not be obvious is how it can be employed in writing templates. Within the bounds of our desire for ergonomics, we should design the <em>interfaces</em> of our templates to maximize the number of identical instantiations.</p>\n<h2 id="whatsinaname">What&#8217;s in a name?</h2>\n<p>The following example, adapted from a real-world change to a large D project, yielded a reduction in compile time of a few percent for unit-test builds.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we have an expensive template whose behavior we want to test over a simple type. Our type might be:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Vector3\n{\n  float x;\n  float y;\n  float z;\n}</pre>\n<p>To demonstrate the phenomenon, we don&#8217;t have to do anything fancy, so we&#8217;ll just declare a stub called <code>send</code>.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// Let\'s say this sends a value of type T to a database.\nvoid send(T)(T x);</pre>\n<p><strong>A note on syntax:</strong> Given a variable <code>val</code> of type <code>int</code>, this template could be explicitly instantiated as <code>send!(int)(val)</code>. However, the compiler can infer the type <code>T</code>, so we can instantiate it as if it were a normal function call as <code>send(val)</code>. Using D&#8217;s <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#pseudo-member">Uniform Function Call Syntax</a>, we could alternatively call it like a property or member, as <code>val.send()</code> (the approach used in the following example), or even <code>val.send</code>, since parentheses are optional in function calls when there are no arguments.</p>\n<p>Our test might then be something like:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Vector3\n{\n  float x;\n  float y;\n  float z;\n}\n\nunittest\n{\n  Vector3 value;\n  value.send();\n}</pre>\n<p>This is reasonable so far. However, an issue arises when we start to write more than one test. Should we want to test different behaviors of a fancy template, but instantiate it with the same type, then we end up spending more time in compilation than we would have expected. A lot more time. And we see large growth in the number of symbols emitted in the resulting binary, resulting in a larger file size than one would expect. Why is that?</p>\n<p>Despite our intuition that the compiler should consider multiple declarations of a type like <code>Vector3</code> in multiple <code>unittest</code> blocks as identical, it actually does not. We can demonstrate this effect with an extremely simple example. We&#8217;ll provide an implementation of <code>send</code> that prints at compile time the type of each instantiation. Then <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/version.html#staticforeach">we&#8217;ll use <code>static foreach</code></a> to generate five distinct implementations of a single unit test.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void send(T)(T x)\n{\n  pragma(msg, T); \n}\n\n// Generate 5 unittest blocks\nstatic foreach(_; 0..5)\n{\n  unittest\n  {\n    struct JustInt\n    {\n      int x;\n    }\n    JustInt value;\n    value.send;\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>This results in the following output from the compiler:</p>\n<pre>JustInt\nJustInt\nJustInt\nJustInt\nJustInt</pre>\n<p>Huh? Doesn&#8217;t this violate our &#8220;you can&#8217;t pay twice&#8221; rule? If you were to take this output from the compiler as gospel, then yes, but there&#8217;s a more subtle truth here.</p>\n<h2 id="fullyqualifiednames">Fully qualified names</h2>\n<p>The name of a type as you would write it in your editor is not the complete name of a type. Let&#8217;s amend the implementation of <code>send</code> to print the return value of a template called <code>fullyQualifiedName</code> rather than printing <code>T</code> directly. The rest of the example remains the same.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void send(T)(T x)\n{\n  import std.traits : fullyQualifiedName;\n  pragma(msg, fullyQualifiedName!T); \n}</pre>\n<p>Assuming the module is named <code>example</code>, this yields something like:</p>\n<pre>example.__unittest_L13_C3_1.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_2.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_3.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_4.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_5.JustInt</pre>\n<p>This explains our previous conundrum. By declaring the type <em>locally</em> in each test, we have actually declared a new type per test, each of which results in a new instantiation.</p>\n<p>A type&#8217;s fully qualified name includes the name of its enclosing scope (<code>{package-name.}module-name.{scope-name(s).}TypeName</code>). The compiler rewrites each <code>unittest</code> as a unique function with a generated name. We have five unique functions, each with its own local, distinct declaration of a <code>JustInt</code> type. And so we end up with five distinct types.</p>\n<p>We want to ensure that one instantiation is reused across <code>unittest</code> blocks. We do that by moving the declaration of <code>JustInt</code> to module scope, outside of the unit tests.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct JustInt\n{\n  int x;\n}\n\nstatic foreach(_; 0..5)\n{\n  unittest\n  {\n    JustInt value;\n    value.send;\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>The <code>send</code> template now prints:</p>\n<pre>example.JustInt</pre>\n<p>Much better.</p>\n<h3 id="someharddata">Some hard data</h3>\n<p>To collect some anecdata about the usefulness of these changes, we&#8217;ll look at compilation times and the size of compiled binaries. Since this template is <em>very</em> trivial, let&#8217;s generate a hundred copies of the same <code>unittest</code> rather than five so we can see a trend.</p>\n<p>On my system, timing the compilation of our programs shows the locally declared types took <strong>243ms</strong> to compile, but the version with a single global type declaration took <strong>159ms</strong> to compile. A difference of <strong>84ms</strong> is not all that much, sure, but in a large codebase, there may be <em>a lot</em> of these speedups waiting to be found. Any reduction in compile times is to be embraced, especially when it&#8217;s cumulative.</p>\n<p>As for binary size, I saw a savings of <code>69K</code> on disk. The quantity of machine code generated by the compiler is worth keeping a close eye on. Larger binaries mean more work for the linker, which in turn means more time waiting for builds to complete. The easiest job is the one you don&#8217;t have to do.</p>\n<h2 id="amorecomplexexample">A more complex example</h2>\n<p>The following example demonstrates a very simple but fundamental change to a template that yields an enormous improvement in compile times and other metrics.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we have a fairly simple interpreter, and we want to expose functions in our D code to the scripts executed by our interpreter. We can do that with some sort of registration function, which we&#8217;ll call <code>register</code>.</p>\n<h3 id="thesignatureoftheregisterfunction">The signature of the register function</h3>\n<p>To prove the point I&#8217;m discussing, we don&#8217;t need to implement this function&mdash;its <em>interface</em> is what can cause a big slow down.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say our <code>register</code> function looks like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// Context is something our hypothetical interpreter works with\nvoid register(alias func, string registeredName)(Context x); </pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty reasonable, right? It takes a template alias parameter that specifies the function to call (a common idiom in D) and a template value parameter of type <code>string</code> that represents the name of the function as it is exposed to scripts. The implementation of <code>register</code> will presumably map the value of <code>registeredName</code> to the <code>func</code> alias, and then scripts can call the function using that value. Functions can be registered with, e.g., the following:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">\ncontext = createAContext();\ncontext.register!(writeln!string, "writeln")();</pre>\n<p>The scripts can call the Phobos <code>writeln</code> function template using the name <code>writeln</code>.</p>\n<h3 id="thecompile-timeperformanceoftheregistertemplate">The compile-time performance of the register template</h3>\n<p>The interface for <code>register</code> looks harmless, but it turns out that it has a significant impact on compile time. We can test this by registering some random functions. The actual contents of the functions don&#8217;t matter&mdash;this article is about template compile times, so we just want a baseline figure for roughly how much time the infrastructure templates take to compile rather than the code they are hooking together.</p>\n<p>Although we will pull the functions out of a hat, the thing that will drive our intuition is to realize that a small number of interfaces will likely be reused many times. We could start with a basket of interface stubs like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">int stub1(string) { return 1; }\n\nint stub2(string) { return 2; }\n\nint stub3(string) { return 3; }\n\n// etc.</pre>\n<p>More broadly, with a bunch of functions that have identical signatures and a bunch of functions with random parameter lists and return types, we can get a rough baseline. With the set of stubs I used, compile times ended up at roughly <strong>5</strong> seconds.</p>\n<p>So what happens if we move the compile-time parameters to run time? Since <code>registeredName</code> is a template value parameter, we can just move it into the function parameter list with no change. We have to handle the <code>func</code> parameter differently. Almost any symbol can bind at compile time to a template alias parameter, but symbols can&#8217;t bind at run time to function parameters. We have to use a function pointer instead. In that case, we can use the type of the referenced function as a template parameter.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void register(FuncType)(Context x, FuncType ptr, string registeredName);</pre>\n<p>With this signature, the compile time drops to roughly <strong>1</strong> second.</p>\n<h3 id="whatsgoingon">What&#8217;s going on?</h3>\n<p>D is a fairly fast language to compile. Good decisions have been made over the lifetime of the language to make that possible. It is also the case that one can happily write slow-to-compile D code. Although we are choosing to ignore the compilation speeds of the non-infrastructure code to simplify the point being made, this can actually (in a certain sense) be the case in real projects, too. As such it is worthwhile to pay attention not to the quantity of metaprogramming being done <em>semantically</em> but rather the quantity of metaprogramming being performed <em>by the compiler</em>.</p>\n<p>In this case, with the first interface used for <code>register</code>, the compiler had no opportunity to reuse any instantiations. Because it accepted the registered functions as symbols, each instantiation was unique. By shifting instead to take the <em>type</em> of the registered function as a template parameter and a pointer to the function as a function parameter, the compiler could reuse instantiations. <code>stub1</code>, <code>stub2</code>, and <code>stub3</code> are distinct symbols, but they each have the same type of (<code>int function(string)</code>).</p>\n<p>To be clear, this is not an indictment of template alias parameters. There are good use cases for them (the Phobos algorithms API is an example). The point of this example is to show how the compile-time costs of unique template instantiations can be hidden. A decision about the trade-offs between compile-time and run-time performance can only be made if the programmer is aware there is a decision to make. So when implementing a template, consider how it will be used. If it&#8217;s going to end up creating many unique instantiations, then you can weigh the benefits of keeping that interface versus redesigning it to maximize reuse.</p>\n<h2 id="afalsefriend">A false friend</h2>\n<p>In linguistics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend">a false friend</a> is a pair of words from two different languages that look the same but have different meanings. I&#8217;m going to abuse this term by using it to refer to a pair of programming patterns that actually result in the same program behavior, but via different routes through the language implementation, i.e., one of these patterns has, say, worse performance or compile times than the other.</p>\n<h3 id="asimpleexample:">A simple example:</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we have a library that exposes a template as part of its API, like this one that prints a string when a module is loaded during run-time initialization:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template FunTemplate(string op)\n{\n  shared static this()\n  {\n    import std.stdio;\n    writeln(op);\n  }\n}\n\n// Use like this\nmixin FunTemplate!&quot;Hello from DLang&quot;;</pre>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s say we want to refactor the library in some way that it&#8217;s desirable to distinguish the name <code>FunTemplate</code> and its implementation. How would you go about doing that?</p>\n<p>One way would be to tack <code>Impl</code> onto the implementation name, then declare an eponymous template that aliases the shortened name to the implementation name and forwards the template argument like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template FunTemplate(string op)\n{\n  alias FunTemplate = FunTemplateImpl!op;\n}</pre>\n<p>This does the job, but it also creates an additional instantiation for each different value of <code>op</code>, one instance of <code>FunTemplate</code>, and one of <code>FunTemplateImpl</code>. So if we instantiate it with, e.g., five different values, we end up with ten unique instantiations. Now imagine doing that with a template that&#8217;s heavily used throughout a program.</p>\n<p>Since we only want to provide an alternate name for the implementation and aren&#8217;t doing anything to the parameter list, we can achieve the same result without adding another template into the mix: just use <code>alias</code> by itself.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">alias FunTemplate = FunTemplateImpl; </pre>\n<p>Since <code>FunTemplate</code> is no longer a template, <code>FunTemplate!&quot;Foo&quot;</code> only creates the one instance of <code>FunTemplateImpl</code>.</p>\n<h2 id="normalizationoftemplatearguments">Normalization of template arguments</h2>\n<p>Once we know what we want a template to look like, and we&#8217;re satisfied with the interface we want it to have, there are sometimes subtle ways to separate the interface and implementation of a template such that we can minimize the total amount of work the compiler has to do.</p>\n<p>The definition of &#8220;work&#8221; in this context can be important to consider, as we can find ways to balance a tradeoff between compile times and the amount of object code generated for each instantiation. One technique to reduce these costs is by normalizing a given list of template arguments into something called a <em>canonical form</em>.</p>\n<h3 id="canonicalforms">Canonical Forms</h3>\n<p>A canonical form, resulting from a process called canonicalization, is a mathematical structure that is intended to reduce multiple different-looking but identical objects into <em>one</em> form that we can then manipulate as we see fit. Using an automatic code formatter is an example of transforming input (in this case, source code) into a canonical form.</p>\n<h3 id="applicationtotemplates">Application to templates</h3>\n<p>Consider a template like this one:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template Expensive(Args...)\n{\n  /* Some kind of expensive metaprogramming or code generation */\n}</pre>\n<p>If we can think of a useful canonical form that isn&#8217;t too hard to compute, we can then write a second template <code>Reduce</code> to implement it, then inject it like in the following example.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template Expensive(Args...)\n{\n  // Reduce to some kind of canonical form\n  alias reduced = Reduce!(Args);\n\n  // Where ExpensiveImpl is the same as above but renamed\n  alias Expensive = ExpensiveImpl!(reduced);\n}</pre>\n<p>To be worth doing, <code>ExpensiveImpl</code> must be <em>significantly</em> more expensive than the reduction operation (pay attention to differences in <code>sys</code> time when measuring this), where &#8220;significant&#8221; is meant statistically rather than informally, i.e., any win is good as long as you can rigorously prove it&#8217;s real.</p>\n<h3 id="anexample:sortingtemplatearguments">An example: sorting template arguments</h3>\n<p>Take a templated aggregate like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct ExposeMethods(Types...)\n{\n  /* Some kind of internal state dependant on Types but not their order */\n\n  static foreach(Type; Types) {\n    bool test(Type x) { \n      /* Something slow to compile depending on Type */\n    }\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>If it&#8217;s instantiated with, e.g., five different types across a large codebase, we could spend a lot of time redoing semantically identical compilation. If all possible types are used as input many times, we could end up with a few permutations, and if not we will probably get a few identical subsets.</p>\n<p>A canonical form that might come to mind (i.e., a potential definition of <code>Reduce</code>) is simply sorting the arguments by their names. This can be achieved <a href="https://dlang.org/library/std/meta/static_sort.html">via the use of <code>staticSort</code></a>.</p>\n<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>D has powerful metaprogramming and code generation features. But like anything in programming, their use isn&#8217;t free. If you want to avoid the situation where you find yourself making coffee while your project builds, then it&#8217;s imperative to be aware of the cost vs. benefits of the metaprogramming features you use. Then you can make intelligent decisions about your compile-time interfaces and implementations.</p>\n<h2 id="appendix-tracingthedcompilertocounttemplateinstantiations">Appendix &#8211; Tracing the D compiler to count template instantiations</h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a simple lesson in Linux userspace tracing: you can use a tool like <code>bpftrace</code> or <code>DTrace</code> to spy on the D compiler compiling other things, so we can get basic figures about the compilation of other D programs without either hacking the compiler or changing their build process.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need a <code>bpftrace</code> file like the following (saved as e.g., <code>main.bt</code>):</p>\n<pre>BEGIN\n{\n  printf("Tracing a D file\\n");\n}\nuprobe:/home/mhh/dlang/dmd-2.097.0/linux/bin64/dmd:_Dmain\n{\n  printf("This is the main\\n");\n}\nuprobe:/home/mhh/dlang/dmd-2.097.0/linux/bin64/dmd:_D3dmd10dsymbolsem24templateInstanceSemanticFCQBs9dtemplate16TemplateInstancePSQCz6dscope5ScopePSQDr4root5array__T5ArrayTCQEq10expression10ExpressionZQBkZv\n{\n  //We do nothing with the knowledge here but if you write some code you can get info about the templates relatively easily\n  printf("Instantiating a template\\n");\n}</pre>\n<p>What am I hooking here? That big mangled name in the middle of the script is <code>templateInstanceSemantic</code> in the <code>dsymbolsem</code> module in the DMD source. By hooking it, we can get a rough idea of when a template is being worked on.</p>\n<p>Running it with <code>sudo bpftrace main.bt</code> (eBPF tracing currently requires root) when building DMD, for example, I see there are about 50,800 template hits.</p>\n<p>You can use a more complicated script in a system like <code>bcc</code> to reconstruct the compiler&#8217;s internal data structures. With that, we can get output a bit more like <code>09:05:17 69310 b\'/home/mhh/d_dev/dmd/src/dmd/errors.d:85\'</code> and actually reconstruct the source/line info (alongside a timestamp and PID).</p>'}]}

It&#8217;s a full-term course with lectures, practical lessons, and exams, although it&#8217;s all remote now. This is the story about how I got there, the challenges I encountered, and how students sometimes surpass their teachers.</p>\n<h2 id="whatsindforuniversitystudents">What&#8217;s in D for university students</h2>\n<p>The job market for D is very small. As I always say during the first lesson, it&#8217;s unlikely that students are going to write D code for a salary, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that learning D is useless. Firstly, it&#8217;s much easier to learn how to program with D than with C or C++. This is important because many students don&#8217;t know how to program even after a full C/C++ course. Secondly, a broader outlook makes for better code. My familiarity with D improved my C++ skills and made it much easier to learn Python, especially its iterators. Most importantly, D is the future&mdash;of C++ and beyond. Many C++11/17/20 novelties were first battle-tested in D, and even today D is a much more modern and feature-rich language than C++.</p>\n<h2 id="whoamiandwhatsindforme">Who am I and what&#8217;s in D for me</h2>\n<p>For simplicity, I would say that I am a C++ programmer. This is my main line of work. Before this course, I&#8217;d never been a teacher of any sort. Even on my job, I&#8217;m not involved much in mentoring. After earning my master&#8217;s degree in Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics at UNN (Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod) in 2014, I had no relation to academics at all.</p>\n<p>In my first months of university, I entertained the thought of being a school teacher. Now I realize that this was just a call for justice of sorts. There is a stark difference between a high school and a university, and for me, the latter was a much better experience. It felt like in just one month at university I learned more than in one term in high school, and that was so cool. <em>Why couldn&#8217;t they explain it <strong>this way</strong> back in high school</em>, was my common thought. If only educators applied the same educational methods in a regular school, it would make the experience much better. My desire to become a teacher vanished the second I received my first paycheck as a programmer (in Russia, &#8216;programmer&#8217; is a very well-paid job and &#8216;school teacher&#8217; is the total opposite), but some memory of that desire remained.</p>\n<p>This was also the time when I became interested in D. Compared to C++ it looked like a perfect programming language. You can write code that would be as fast, but without all those C atavisms. I used D for my master&#8217;s thesis, and I loved it. My program was twice as small and simple as the older C++ version while performing better. Implementing complex and more efficient algorithms in D was much easier; doing the same in C++ would be too much work, and, like any student, I always struggled with my deadlines.</p>\n<p>Since then I&#8217;ve followed D and used it for my little pet projects. I&#8217;ve always wanted to help the D community in some way, but I couldn&#8217;t write any useful library, nor could I find the motivation for contributing to open source.</p>\n<h2 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h2>\n<p>In 2018, an unusual offer surfaced on the D mailing list: does anyone by any chance want to teach students in Moscow, Russia?</p>\n<p>The initiator was Dmitry Olshansky, a well-known member of the D community, the creator of <code>std.regex</code> and more. I contacted him and said I was interested. I didn&#8217;t see myself as a full-fledged lecturer and expected to be just an assistant. At the beginning that was the plan, with someone else acting as a lecturer. He was going to give lectures remotely via Skype, and I would assist him on site.</p>\n<p>To my surprise, the university in question was RSUH, Russian State University for the <em>Humanities</em>. As it turned out, they do have technical faculty there, and the students do actually code. I checked their program: D was introduced for third-term students, and during the first two terms they learned C, C++, Prolog, and even some Lisp, I think (a bit too much, but why not). Their math course was solid, too (yes, I am among those who think that math is important for programmers).</p>\n<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>\n<p>I was introduced to the department staff. They explained everyone&#8217;s responsibilities and even offered the opportunity to join in scientific work as a programmer. We started working on the course program, although I barely included myself in that “we”. That was a mistake. With one month left until the classes started, the lecturer was suddenly leaving us. The news took me by surprise, but&#8230; there was still plenty of time, right?</p>\n<p>This was happening when it was time for me to complete all the formalities and start work. Though I knew they were hiring only me, for some reason I was still under the impression that I wouldn&#8217;t be alone. I can&#8217;t say why I thought so. Everything was saying that there would be no help and that I had to do the whole course by myself, but my impression was hard to shake. The grave realization only came one week before Day One. Only then did I start to prepare for real.</p>\n<h2 id="bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</h2>\n<p>This is supposed to be the part about the trials and tribulations of the endless bureaucracy awaiting a poor programmer&#8217;s soul. The amount of paperwork required to sign the contract was indeed an entertaining story to tell to my peers. And everyone was, as they say, “rolling on the floor laughing” when I described applying for a Mir payroll card (Mir is the Russian national payment system mandated in the state-funded sector). But that&#8217;s it, actually.</p>\n<p>The next bureaucratic task was composing the formal program, an official paper including the course program and the materials. There were indeed a lot of formalities there, but I got some help: they showed me the paper for a very similar course. At the end of the day, it was easier than I expected. For this, I should thank the university staff. It was a one-year contract. Renewing it every year only takes one piece of paper and a couple of pen strokes.</p>\n<h2 id="thefirstclass">The first class</h2>\n<p>The schedule was set up such that my first class happened to be a seminar (a.k.a. a practical lesson) instead of a lecture. This is only on paper, though with only one group consisting of just 14 people it didn&#8217;t make any difference. The schedule was adjusted later. I got two classes in a row and could decide which was a lecture and which was a seminar. I came up with the following arrangement: in the first class, I would lecture and answer general questions, and in the second, the students would program and ask practical questions.</p>\n<p>For the first lesson, I prepared a brief description of the language, a syntax overview, a compiler, and several problems to solve: calculating the area of a triangle, solving a quadratic equation, and similar problems that yield a simple output for simple input. The idea was to immerse students in the language and immediately give them something to do with it. The plan was a success. By the end of the class, most of the students had gotten the hang of using a command-line compiler, written some code in a text editor, and solved some problems.</p>\n<h2 id="notepadandthecommandline">Notepad and the command line</h2>\n<p>I bet many people would take issue with the command line and text editor part. Seriously? No IDE? IDEs for D exist, but I left it up to the students if they wanted to use them. The reason was my own experience in learning C++ and programming in general. Knowing how a compiler works and how to link several files into a project is integral to understanding the language as a whole.</p>\n<p>This is especially true for C and C++. Things like the difference between declaration and definition lose their meaning without understanding the build process. In D, such nuances are fewer. For example, header files are not required. Still, I meant to teach how to program in D, not how to use an IDE. Things like the principles of <code>import</code> are easier to grok when using a command-line compiler rather than some “intuitive interface”. And you learn the syntax faster if you write the code by hand without autocomplete doing it for you.</p>\n<h2 id="furtherdevelopment">Further development</h2>\n<p>Lifted by the success of the first seminar, I was slammed to the ground by the first lecture. It contained the full theoretical explanation of type systems and their various types, compared D with other languages, brought out the problems of C and C++, and demonstrated what makes D different. It was a total failure.</p>\n<p>I expected the lecture to take the whole 80-minute class, including questions, but it finished in less than an hour without a single question during or after the speech. I even asked if the students couldn&#8217;t hear or understand me, or if there was a problem with my diction. But the problem was with the lecture itself. First, it was too much for one class. Second, the lecture was based on the talks I did for my job that were intended for seasoned programmers. I realized that everything that I&#8217;d prepared for my future lectures must be tossed aside and rewritten from scratch.</p>\n<h2 id="thenewprogram">The new program</h2>\n<p>The first candidate for simplification, and by that I mean expunging, was metaprogramming. Getting rid of templates was impossible since even the most basic language features and algorithms are tied to them, but code generation of all sorts was the first to be removed. Following that was anything that required external libraries. What was left were things that D code can&#8217;t be written without.</p>\n<p>Since I had better success with live communication during actual programming, I decided to focus on that. Rewriting the course on the fly was tricky, but I came up with a solid plan: throughout the semester we would write a complex calculating program, during lectures we would study language features required for a given task, and then during seminars the ideas would be transformed into code.</p>\n<h2 id="thesemesterassignment">The semester assignment</h2>\n<p>If you’re a nerd like me, you’ve probably heard of <a href="https://youtu.be/-ruC5A9EzzE">the 10,958 problem</a>. The gist of it is that you need to put signs and parentheses between numbers composed of the digits 1 to 9 so that the result would be exactly 10,958. The solution exists for any number up to 11,000, except 10,958. There&#8217;s no proof that it doesn&#8217;t exist either, hence the 10,958 problem.</p>\n<p>I gave the students an assignment to write a program that would find the solution, brute-forcing any possible combination of signs and parenthesis. All calculations were done with <code>double</code> instead of some sort of <code>bignum</code>, so it&#8217;s not a real solution, but it&#8217;s simpler this way.</p>\n<p>I had several reasons to think that this was a well-fitting problem. First, I could write a solution I expected to see from the students in five hours or two evenings. Compensating for the students&#8217; level, it looked like a good project for a semester-long assignment. Second, the solution isn&#8217;t too straightforward. Simple brute force would take too much time so you need to cut off the equal variants in the beginning. And third, I was fascinated by this problem myself, so I thought the students would feel the same. I couldn&#8217;t be more wrong.</p>\n<p>Not only were a majority of students not into such mathematics, most of them couldn&#8217;t even grasp what the problem was about and what this 10,958 was for. I failed to get them interested.</p>\n<p>When I realized the problem, it was too late to change anything. So the first semester wasn&#8217;t very engaging. Only a few students could finish the assignment to its fullest. For the rest, it was impossible.</p>\n<h2 id="thesecondsemester">The second semester</h2>\n<p>Since it was a full-term course, I had time to make up for it. For the second semester, I tried to come up with something practical and interactive. I gave the students an assignment to write a game. They were learning networking, so it was to be a multiplayer game. I recalled playing “tic-tac-toe on an infinite field” with my peers during boring lectures. The smarter name for this game is Gomoku. Two players can play online, and the game logic is simple. I was hoping to spark students&#8217; interest. This assignment turned out much better than the previous one, but I still can&#8217;t call it a full success.</p>\n<p>I really wanted to show them how coroutines (fibers, as they are called in D) make async programming much more manageable, how nice <a href="https://vibed.org/">the vibe.d framework</a> is, and how easy it is to use external libraries with <a href="https://code.dlang.org/">the dub package manager</a>. Lesson One: don&#8217;t try to sell coroutines to those who don&#8217;t know what callback hell is. Lesson Two: always keep hardware limitations in mind.</p>\n<h2 id="problemsoutofnowhere">Problems out of nowhere</h2>\n<p>I would never have thought that single-threaded compilation could be thwarted by the memory limit. It happened because the computers at the university were equipped with only 2 GB of memory, and some students&#8217; netbooks worked on a mere 1 GB. Simple programs build just fine even on weak machines&mdash;D is much better than C++ in terms of compilation time&mdash;but a large framework like vibe.d requires a lot of memory for its compilation. Now imagine, I was just telling them how everything is so easy-peasy and then half the students couldn&#8217;t even compile a networked version of Hello World.</p>\n<p>In my defense, I checked everything in advance. I set up a virtual machine with 2 GB of memory and made sure that it worked with the special compiler flags. Theoretically, I was prepared. But dealing with a new library <em>and</em> a new build system <em>and</em> new compiler flags all at once was just too much for the students. Their brains were getting DoS’d and shut down. So even though I demonstrated how to compile a program on a low-memory machine, I still had to explain to them individually why the usual method of compilation wasn&#8217;t working. For those who had only 1 GB of memory, I didn&#8217;t even have a ready solution.</p>\n<p>But still, the results of the second semester were much better: absolutely everyone could write the client side of the game. Some had problems with coroutines on the server side, but in general, they got this part just fine. For me, that wasn&#8217;t enough. So I gave them a supertask: write a simple AI for the game. This would help them understand the advantages of the client-server architecture. They had to realize that an AI is just another client, so the server code should be left as it is, and on the client side, the only required modification was move polling. This was a good problem on architecture design, suitable for students who already had gotten a grip on programming.</p>\n<p>We also had a little contest. I invited the students to play some code golf, solving a simple problem with the smallest program possible. For encouragement, I promised to free the best-achieving students from writing a semester report. And if anyone could beat my solution, they would pass the semester examination automatically (in Russian universities, teachers are allowed to set arbitrary conditions, like participating in side projects, for passing the semester without the usual examination).</p>\n<p>As I expected, nobody could beat me, though a couple of students came up with some interesting tricks, like writing <code>10</code> instead of <code>"\\0"</code> to save two symbols. Some would say this is an abuse of the type system, but clever hacks like this speak to a student&#8217;s knowledge.</p>\n<h2 id="theresultsofthefirstyear">The results of the first year</h2>\n<p>I was asking too much for a single semester; only one student could write an AI that kind of worked (she said that the first time it made a sensible move, it made her really happy). Another student who complained the whole year that programming was not her thing and that she couldn&#8217;t understand anything managed to write her own client and server. At the end of the day, all was not for nothing.</p>\n<h2 id="thesecondtry">The second try</h2>\n<p>Everything described until this point happened during the 2018/2019 academic year. The higher-ups had no issues with the course, and I was able to continue on the following year. New students, new possibilities, a new program. This time I was much better prepared. I had materials for most of the lectures, no more need to redo everything on the fly, and during the summer I had time to fix the problems with the course.</p>\n<p>The 10,958 problem was expelled on the charge of being boring. Instead, the Gomoku game was expanded, now lasting <em>almost</em> the whole term. &#8220;Almost&#8221; because the first assignment was a problem regarding OOP: students had to implement various geometrical shapes as classes and draw them on screen with some customization. I made this the first step after Hello World so everyone could learn how to use the tools, and so I could judge their level.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that students are very different. Some are already working as programmers and attend the course out of curiosity, while some still struggle with variables and loops. From the beginning, I decided that my course would be not just for everyone, but for those who are interested. However, disregarding the others would be wrong, so we needed assignments for different levels.</p>\n<p>To jump-start the network study, I set up a server with the reference implementation, and everyone could connect to it and play. Even telnet would do. Allotting more time for an assignment and providing better explanations served students well. Many could finish the supertask. We even had a little contest between AIs. A human could still beat them with ease, but it was still a big improvement over the previous year.</p>\n<h2 id="apleasantsurprise">A pleasant surprise</h2>\n<p>I had the same code golf contest again. And again, I promised to give a free pass to whoever could beat me. I&#8217;m sure you can see where this is going, but first I must explain the problem in detail. The task was to implement a function, <code>challenge</code>, defined as follows:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import std;\n\n/**\n* Params:\n* s = Multiline string, each line containing positive integers separated by whitespace.\n* Returns: An array containing the sums of each line and the grand total as the last element.\n*/\nuint[] challenge(string s);\n\nunittest {\n    assert(challenge("0") == [0, 0]);\n    assert(challenge("1\\n1") == [1, 1, 2]);\n    assert(challenge("2\\n2\\n3") == [2, 2, 3, 7]);\n    assert(challenge("2\\n2 0 3\\n3 1 1 4") == [2, 5, 9, 16]);\n}</pre>\n<p>Only the symbols inside the function body count. Using any Phobos functionality is allowed, but no renamed imports.</p>\n<p>My solution from the previous year was pretty straightforward:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto r=s.split(\'\\n\').map!(a=&gt;a.split.map!(i=&gt;i.to!uint).sum); return r.array~r.sum; // 84 characters</pre>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t show them my solution, I just told them its character count. I was absolutely sure that, just like the previous year, nobody could beat it. Imagine my shock when I was outdone in a mere week:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto r=split(src,&quot;\\n&quot;).map!&quot;sum(map!(to!uint)(a.split))&quot;.array;return r~[sum(r)]; // 82 characters</pre>\n<p>Even with the unneeded brackets, this solution was better, thanks to the shortened <code>map</code> syntax: passing a lambda as a string in the first case and passing <code>to</code> directly in the second. The latter was just my oversight, but the former was a typical teacher&#8217;s mistake. You see, back when I first wrote my solution, it wasn&#8217;t possible to pass a string to <code>map</code> like that. I don&#8217;t remember well what the problem was, something about scopes. I missed that it was fixed at some point. That&#8217;s how in just one year you become an old geezer teacher who can&#8217;t keep up with the times.</p>\n<p>I stayed true to my word and granted a free pass to the resourceful student at the end of the semester. I was concerned that securing the pass in the middle of the semester would demotivate him to attend classes, but fortunately, I was wrong.</p>\n<h2 id="covid-19strikes">COVID-19 strikes</h2>\n<p>Of course, I can&#8217;t omit how the pandemic impacted the educational system. In the spring of 2020, all classes were moved online. There are some pros and cons to this.</p>\n<p>Giving lectures remotely turned out to be very convenient. You can mutually agree on a suitable time, and you don&#8217;t need to find a free lecture room. Another very good thing is that students can either ask questions vocally&mdash;as when they raise their hands offline&mdash;or write them in the chat so that the teacher can answer them when it&#8217;s most appropriate. I really think that this system works very well.</p>\n<p>Practical lessons are problematic though, especially with those students who aren&#8217;t involved enough. When they sit in a classroom they at least do something. Why show up at all if you&#8217;re not going to do anything? When it&#8217;s online, they just skip class. The chemistry of a group coding session with a teacher ready to help won&#8217;t kick in. I encouraged them to ask questions not only during class but at any time, hoping that this would allow me to assist them whenever they are coding. But this only worked for a couple of people.</p>\n<h2 id="lessonsofthesecondyear">Lessons of the second year</h2>\n<p>The second year was better than the first but still less than ideal. I saw no need to modify the course, but its presentation had to be addressed.</p>\n<p>We need to tear down this wall in communication. Mutual trust between the teacher and the student makes for a better educational process. It&#8217;s difficult to work with those who are wary of the teacher even when doing alright. I don&#8217;t yet know a robust solution; each case is tackled individually.</p>\n<p>Even those who are doing well need some control. I used to think that attendance scrutiny is for those students who don&#8217;t really want to learn, to intimidate them to show up. When I was a student, the best teachers never bothered about absentees. So I too was liberal with these things, even when half the group was missing. But everything has its limits. Bad students will skip classes anyway, but lazy B-graders could benefit from a little scolding.</p>\n<h2 id="fastforwardtothepresent">Fast forward to the present</h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have much to say about the last year-and-a-half. Teaching D is now part of my life. Due to the pandemic, we&#8217;ve had to move online completely. I couldn&#8217;t even meet my students face-to-face. Aside from what I said earlier about how this affects the educational process, this also disrupted one of the ideas I had.</p>\n<p>I need some way to track students&#8217; progress to be sure that they actually follow the course and don&#8217;t just show up for classes. The way I handled this during the previous two years worked for some students: if they had a problem, they asked questions during a lecture or a practical lesson. But some students just keep quiet when they have problems, so I need some means to identify them. I couldn&#8217;t do written tests for programming; that would be nonsense. So during the summer break, I came up with the idea of doing some small quizzes if COVID restrictions were to be lifted. These quizzes would affect the final grade, but not much, as the intention behind them was to help students who are having problems, not to be the final straw that breaks the camel&#8217;s back. Unfortunately, remote lessons made this nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>My students keep surprising me, coming up with newer and better solutions to the code golf puzzle. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have the exact code of the student who won in the third year (it appears that she deleted her Github account), but it was something like:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto r=s.split(\'\\n\').map!(a=&gt;a.split.to!(uint[]).sum); return r.array~r.sum; // 74 characters </pre>\n<p>Again, it was a feature I didn&#8217;t know about: <code>to</code> converts between arrays, too.</p>\n<p>I thought that this problem was done and that there was no room for further improvement. Oh, how wrong I was. This is what they&#8217;ve brought me this year:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">return(s.split(\'\\n\')~s).map!(a=&gt;a.split.to!(uint[]).sum).array; // 63 characters</pre>\n<p>This completely destroys my solution with all the improvements! Note that the trick is not in the syntax, but in the logic. This works by concatenating the split lines with the original string, making it unnecessary to declare an intermediate array, which allows implementing this function as a single statement. I would never have thought to do that! Algorithms win over micro-optimizations, even in code golf.</p>\n<p>The biggest change this year is a new, formalized evaluation system. In the semester, students earn points for doing assignments and writing reports on them. The first and simplest assignment is worth 5 points, and the last and hardest is worth 30. The maximum number of points a student can score without participating in code golf is 100. Code golf is scored by the formula <code>110 − length</code>. The code golf winner this year got 47 points for his solution which earned him an exemption from writing any reports. We have a table listing every student&#8217;s points so everybody knows how many points they need to score. Everything is very transparent, so I don&#8217;t need to worry about not being objective when evaluating students.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://dlang.org/blog/2022/02/19/how-i-taught-the-d-programming-language-at-a-russian-university/feed/', 'slash_comments': '3'}

A PDF of an early report with the title &lsquo;Single-Block Navier-Stokes Integrator&rsquo; <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA240385">can be found here</a>. It describes the simple finite-volume formulation of the code that allows simulation of a nonreacting gas on a single, structured grid. Thirty years on, many capabilities have been added through the efforts of a number of academic staff and students. These capabilities include high-temperature thermochemical effects with reacting gases and distributed-memory parallel simulations on cluster computers. The language in which the program was written changed from C to C++, with connections to Tcl, Python and Lua.</p>\n<p>The motivation for using C++ in combination with the scripting languages was to allow many code variations and user programmability so that we could tackle any number of initially unimagined gas-dynamic processes as new PhD students arrived to do their studies. By 2010, the Eilmer3 code (as it was called by then) was sitting at about 100k lines of code and was growing. We were, and still are, mechanical engineers and students of gas-dynamics first and programmers second. C++ was a lot of trouble for us. Over the next 4 years, C++ became even more trouble for us as the Eilmer3 code grew to about 250k lines of code and many PhD students used it to do all manner of simulations for their thesis studies.</p>\n<p>Also in 2010, a couple of us (<a href="https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/docs/introduction/dev-team-and-contributors/">PAJ and RJG</a>) living in different parts of the world (Queensland, Australia and Virginia, USA) came across the D programming language and took note of Andrei Alexandrescu’s promise of stability into the future. Here was the promise of a C++ replacement that we could use to rebuild our code and remain somewhat sane. We each bought <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Books">a copy of Andrei’s book</a> and experimented with the D language to see if it really was the <em>C++-done-right</em> that we wished for. One of us still has the copy of the initial printing of Andrei’s book without his name on the front cover.</p>\n<h3 id="rebuilding-in-d">Rebuilding in D</h3>\n<p>In 2014 we got serious about using D for the next iteration of Eilmer and started porting the core gas dynamics code from C++ to D. Over the next four years, in between university teaching activities, we reimplemented much of the Eilmer3 C++ code in D and extended it. We think that this was done to good effect. <a href="https://www.scientific.net/AMM.846.54">This conference paper</a>, from late 2015, documents our effort at the initial port of the structured grid solver. (<a href="https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/pdfs/T0316-eilmer-dlang-v2.pdf">A preprint is hosted on our site</a>.) The Eilmer4 program is as fast as the earlier C++ program but is far more versatile while being implemented in fewer lines of code. It now works with unstructured as well as structured grids and has a new flexible boundary condition model, a high-temperature thermochemistry module, and in the past two years we have added the Newton-Krylov-accelerated steady-state solver that was used to do the simulation shown above. And importantly for us, with the code now being in D, we now have have many fewer <em>WTF</em> moments.</p>\n<p>If you want more details on our development of the Eilmer4 code in D, we have the <a href="https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/docs/pub-n-pres/presentations/">slides from a number of presentations</a> given to the <a href="https://mechmining.uq.edu.au/research/hypersonics">Centre for Hypersonics</a> over the past six years.</p>\n<h3 id="features-of-d-that-have-been-of-benefit-to-us-include">Features of D that have been of benefit to us include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Template programming that other Mechanical Engineers can understand (thanks Walter!). Many of our numerical routines are defined to work with <code>numbers</code> that we define as an alias to either <code>double</code> or <code>Complex!double</code> values. This has been important to us because we can use the same basic update code and get the sensitivity coefficients via finite differences in the complex direction. We think this saved us a large number of lines of code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>String mixins have replaced our use of the M4 preprocessor to generate C++ code in Eilmer3. We still have to do a bit of head-scratching while building the code with mixins, but we have retained most of our hair—something that we did not expect to do if we continued to work with C++.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Good error messages from the compiler. We often used to be overwhelmed by the C++ template error messages that could run to hundreds of lines. The D compilers have been much nicer to us and we have found the “did you mean” suggestions to be quite useful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A comprehensive standard library in combination with language features such as delegates and closures that allow us to write less code and instead concentrate on our gas dynamics calculations. I think that having to use C++ Functors was about the tipping point in our 25-year adventure with C++.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ranges and the foreach loops make our D code so much tidier than our equivalent C++ code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Low-barrier shared-memory parallelism. We do many of the flow update calculations in parallel over blocks of cells and we like to take advantage of the many cores that are available on a typical workstation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Simple and direct linkage to C libraries. We make extensive use of Lua for our configuration and do large simulations by using many processors in parallel via the OpenMPI library.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The garbage collector is wonderful, even if other people complain about it. It makes life simpler for us. For the input and output, we take the comfortable path of letting the compiler manage the memory and then tell the garbage collector to tidy up after us. Of course, we don’t want to overuse it. <span class="citation">@nogc</span> is used in the core of the code to force us not to generate garbage. We allocate much of our data storage at the start of a simulation and then pass references to parts of it into the core functions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fast compilation and good optimizing compilers. Nearly an hour’s build time was fairly common for our old C++ code, and now we would expect a DMD or LDC debug build in about a quarter of a minute. This builds a basic version of the main simulation code on a Lenovo ThinkPad with Core i7 processor. An optimized build can take a little over a minute but the benefit of the faster simulation is paid back by orders of magnitude when a simulation job is run for several hours over hundreds of processors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>version(xxxx) { ... }</code> has been a good way to have variants of the code. Some use complex numbers and others are just double numbers. Also, some variants of the code can have multiple chemical species and/or just work with a single-species nonreacting gas. This reduction in physical modelling allows us to reduce the memory required by the simulation. For big simulations of 3D flows, the required memory can be on the order of hundreds of gigabytes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>debug { ... }</code> gets used to hide IO code in <code>@nogc</code> functions. If a simulation fails, our first action is often to run the debug-flavor of the code to get more information and then, if needed, run the debug flavor of the code under the control of <code>gdb</code> to dig into the details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a very specialized application and so don’t make use of much of the software ecosystem that has built up around the D language. For a build tool, we use <code>make</code> and for an IDE, we use emacs. The D major mode is very convenient.</p>\n<p>There are lots of other features that just work together to make our programming lives a bit better. We are six years in on our adventure with the D programming language and we are still liking it.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://dlang.org/blog/2022/02/02/a-gas-dynamics-toolkit-in-d/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5'}

Target your questions towards that, target your screening exercises towards that.</p>\n<p>Try your best to walk out of the screen with the ability to say, "They\'re a good fit because…" And if you fail to walk out with that, well- it\'s not really a statement about the candidate. It just doesn\'t work out. Nothing personal.</p>\n<p>But if the code they do write during the screen is uniquely terrible, feel free to send it to us anyway.

While that would likely be much smaller, regexes are expensive- in performance and frequently in cognitive overhead- and I actually have no objections to people scanning strings.</p>\n<p>But let\'s dig into what we\'re doing here.</p>\n<p>They start with a null check, which sure. Then they trim the string; never a good sign when your homemade <code>trim</code> method calls the built-in.</p>\n<p>Then, they iterate across the string, copying characters into a <code>StringBuffer</code>. If the current character is above unicode character 20- the realm of printable characters- <em>and</em> if the last character was a whitespace character, we copy a whitespace character into the output, and then the printable character into the output.</p>\n<p>What this function does is simply <em>replace</em> runs of whitespace with single whitespace characters. </p><pre>"This        string"</pre> becomes <pre>"This string"</pre><p></p>\n<p><em>Badly</em> I should add. Because there are plenty of whitespace characters which appear above <code>\\u0020</code>- like the non-breaking space (<code>\\u00A0</code>), and many other control characters. While you might be willing to believe your users will never figure out how to type those, you can\'t guarantee that they\'ll never copy/paste them.</p>\n<p>For me, however, this function does something far worse than being bad at removing extraneous whitespace.

This was in production, and had been in production for sometime.</p>\n<p><strong>Mike P</strong> picked up the ticket, and was able to track down the problem to a file called <code>Strings.java</code>. Yes, at some point, someone wrote a bunch of string helper functions and jammed them into a package. Of course, many of the functions were re-implementations of existing functions: reinvented wheels, now available in square.</p>\n<p>For example, the <code>trim</code> function.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-java">    <span class="hljs-comment">/**\n     * <span class="hljs-doctag">@param</span> str\n     * <span class="hljs-doctag">@return</span> The trimmed string, or null if the string is null or an empty string.\n     */</span>\n    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> String <span class="hljs-title function_">trim</span><span class="hljs-params">(String str)</span> {\n        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (str == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>) {\n            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;\n        }\n\n        <span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">ret</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> str.trim();\n\n        <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">len</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> ret.length();\n        <span class="hljs-type">char</span> <span class="hljs-variable">last</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">\'\\u0021\'</span>;    <span class="hljs-comment">// choose a character that will not be interpreted as whitespace</span>\n        <span class="hljs-type">char</span> c;\n        <span class="hljs-type">StringBuffer</span> <span class="hljs-variable">sb</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">StringBuffer</span>();\n        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">i</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; len; i++) {\n            c = ret.charAt(i);\n            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (c &gt; <span class="hljs-string">\'\\u0020\'</span>) {\n                <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (last &lt;= <span class="hljs-string">\'\\u0020\'</span>) {\n                    sb.append(<span class="hljs-string">\' \'</span>);\n                }\n                sb.append(c);\n            }\n            last = c;\n        }\n        ret = sb.toString();\n\n        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-string">""</span>.equals(ret)) {\n            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;\n        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {\n            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> ret;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, Mike\'s complaint is that this function could have been replaced with a regular expression. While that would likely be much smaller, regexes are expensive- in performance and frequently in cognitive overhead- and I actually have no objections to people scanning strings.</p>\n<p>But let\'s dig into what we\'re doing here.</p>\n<p>They start with a null check, which sure. Then they trim the string; never a good sign when your homemade <code>trim</code> method calls the built-in.</p>\n<p>Then, they iterate across the string, copying characters into a <code>StringBuffer</code>. If the current character is above unicode character 20- the realm of printable characters- <em>and</em> if the last character was a whitespace character, we copy a whitespace character into the output, and then the printable character into the output.</p>\n<p>What this function does is simply <em>replace</em> runs of whitespace with single whitespace characters. </p><pre>"This        string"</pre> becomes <pre>"This string"</pre><p></p>\n<p><em>Badly</em> I should add. Because there are plenty of whitespace characters which appear above <code>\\u0020</code>- like the non-breaking space (<code>\\u00A0</code>), and many other control characters. While you might be willing to believe your users will never figure out how to type those, you can\'t guarantee that they\'ll never copy/paste them.</p>\n<p>For me, however, this function does something far worse than being bad at removing extraneous whitespace. Because it has that check at the end- if I handed it a perfectly good string that is <em>only</em> whitespace, it hands me back a null.</p>\n<p>I can see the argument- it\'s a bad input, so just give me back an objectively bad result. No <code>IsNullOrEmpty</code> check, just a simple null check. But I still hate it- turning an actual value into a <code>null</code> just bothers me, and seems like an easy way to cause problems.</p>\n<p>In any case, the root problem with this bug was simply developer invented requirements: the users never <em>wanted</em> stray spaces to be automatically removed in the middle of the string.

I dunno, something like that really sounds like it could get you to some kind of universally unique value.</p>\n<p>Then again, since the throughput is well under 1,000 messages per second, you could probably <em>also</em> just let your database handle it, and maybe not generate the IDs in code.</p>\n<!-- Easy Reader Version: This easy reader version is a duplicate of a previous one, so I\'ll just take a nap. -->\n<div>\n\t<img src="https://thedailywtf.com/images/inedo/proget-icon.png" style="display: block; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" /> [Advertisement] \n\tKeep the plebs out of prod.

Thus, the finished product has a number of zones that\'s the union of all of the zones of its component widgets.</p>\n<p>Which someone decided to handle this way:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">zones.<span class="hljs-title function_">reduce</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">accumulator, currentValue</span>) =&gt;</span> accumulator = _.<span class="hljs-title function_">union</span>(currentValue))\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, we reduce across <code>zones</code> (which is an array of arrays, where the innermost arrays contain zone names, like <code>zone-0</code>, <code>zone-1</code>). In each step we <code>union</code> it with… nothing. The LoDash union function expects an array of arrays, and returns an array that\'s the union of all its inputs. This isn\'t how that function is meant to be used, but the behavior from this incorrect usage was that <code>accumulator</code> would end up holding the last element in <code>zones</code>. Which actually worked until recently, because until recently no one was splitting products across zones. When all the inputs were in the same zone, grabbing the last one was just fine.</p>\n<p>The code had been like this for years. It was only just recently, as the company expanded, that it became problematic. The fix, at least, was easy- drop the <code>reduce</code> and just <code>union</code> correctly.</p>\n<!-- Easy Reader Version: You know what, you should join a union. --><div>\n\t<img src="https://thedailywtf.com/images/inedo/proget-icon.png" style="display: block; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" /> [Advertisement] \n\tProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds. <a href="https://inedo.com/proget/private-nuget-server?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footer&amp;utm_content=GotYouCoveredFooter&amp;utm_campaign=Cyclops2020">Learn more.</a>\n</div>\n<div style="clear: left;"> </div>'}, 'slash_comments': '9', 'wfw_comment': 'https://thedailywtf.com/articles/comments/reduced-to-a-union'}

And honestly? That feels amazing. Fun escapism is on the horizon, and I’m here for it.</p><h4>Legion Remix</h4><p class="">Aside from the power-leveling of alts and awesome rewards, I have a feeling there are a few reasons why this is one of the expansions they decided to remix. From what I understand, Legion was one of the more popular expansions, but the end of the expansion also has strong lore ties to what is going on currently. I feel like they want us to go back for the story, or at least I want to go back for the story, and I’m just hoping they want us to as well.</p><p class="">I also think this ties into why they did the Mists of Pandaria remix, which I unfortunately missed. After watching episode 5 of a lore and history series on YouTube, <em>Before the Mists: What was Pandaria really like?</em> from Quaylin, I’ve been thinking a lot about the Thunder King and all the lore and history in Pandaria. (Also, highly recommend that series if you like lore: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEyTJ3_GpaHRKIZ31190_-OuxCTfCafXZ&amp;si=b-EWYQynXZojo_0O" target="_blank">Quaylin’s Playlist</a>).</p><p class="">On top of that, I want to create a short story that might turn into something longer for a character I’ve had in the back of my mind. Most, if not all, of my WoW characters have a backstory, but there’s one story in particular I want to play around with. I’m hoping it’ll help get me back into writing creatively and also make me a better writer. You know, the whole “practice makes perfect” thing. The first in that series is coming out next week, and I’m pretty excited about it.</p><h4>Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity</h4><p class="">As most of my friends know, I adore Guild Wars 2. It has such rich and deep lore, plus it does a really great job of giving you the story via your hero panel if you’ve been away awhile and forgotten what you were up to. Kind of like a gaming bookmark. On top of that, the game is visually stunning, and they just do a lot of things well that I feel some games (<em>cough</em> World of Warcraft <em>cough</em>) take and use for their own. Warbands, I’m looking at you.</p><p class="">I also recently got some new friends into the game. It’s such a delight seeing new players enjoy Guild Wars 2. At first, one of my friends was like, <em>“Oh, I’ll play when you’re on.”</em> Then the next thing I know, they went out and started exploring on their own. I was so proud of them! They’re gamers, but MMOs haven’t really been their thing before. Sadly, Lost Ark was their first MMO, and I was like, <em>“Girl, that is not a game you want to start with.”</em></p><p class="">And of course, the Halloween event is right around the corner. In real life, I’m not the hugest Halloween fan, but there’s something about the Guild Wars 2 version that brings me so much joy. It’s campy and lighthearted, with just the right touch of spooky and decoration. It’s always a good time, and I’m really looking forward to experiencing it with my friends.</p><h4>Dispatch &amp; Anno 117</h4><p class="">I’m looking forward to Dispatch and Anno 117 for different but also similar reasons. They’re both the kinds of games I love to sink into when I’m feeling socially overwhelmed and want to game without any pressure.</p><p class=""><strong>Anno 117</strong> is a city builder (my absolute favorite genre) that will take us to the Roman Empire this time around. I can’t wait to experiment with creating a city that not only functions well but also looks beautiful.</p><p class=""><strong>Dispatch</strong>, on the other hand, is a story-driven, choices-matter RPG with a superhero twist. It features an incredible cast of actors, including two of my favorites from the voice acting world, Travis Willingham and Laura Bailey, as well as Jeffrey Wright. I LOVE Jeffrey Wright.</p><p class="">Both games are ones I know I’ll enjoy for months and months: replaying Dispatch to explore different choices, and perfecting the greatest city I can in Anno.</p><h4>WoW Player Housing</h4><p class="">I cannot even contain my excitement for player housing coming to WoW. I love to decorate in any game that lets me, which is why I adore city builders. Decorating scratches a creative itch for me since I can’t really do that in real life. HGTV is one of my all-time favorite channels, and I’ve basically been using games as my own personal HGTV show ever since The Sims 1 released.</p><p class="">The controls for decorating in WoW also look really similar to Second Life, which I have a lot of experience with. I even have an interior design business in SL, so I know I’ll be able to pull off some pretty amazing things. Once December 2nd rolls around, I’m going to be knee-deep in not only decorating my house but also leveling up the renown for it so I can have <em>all the things</em>!</p><p class="">I also plan to showcase myself decorating and the whole process that goes into it. That should be a lot of fun, kind of like a virtual MMO version of HGTV. Maybe that’ll be the moment I give YouTube another try… probably not, but at the very least I have this space to share all my design ideas.</p><h4>Countdown to Cozy Chaos</h4><p class="">So that is everything on the horizon until the end of the year. I haven’t had this much gaming content to bring me joy in such a long time. It’s hard not to be overwhelmed, but also it feels like being a kid waiting for their birthday or Christmas. Which is ironic because both my birthday and Christmas will be in the middle of all these things.</p><p class="">So if you need me between now and the holidays, you’ll find me happily lost in one of these worlds. Much excite, indeed.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759370554986-2X8R5BJOO4FD5A3AAJ7H/Much+Excite.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

To say I’ve blogged in the past would be an understatement. I’ve had several, all short lived, so we’ll see how this goes. Lately the quick bursts I toss on Mastodon don’t feel like enough. “But blogging? That’s so old school,” I hear you say. Yes, a blog. I know it’s 2025, but I don’t want to stream. Making YouTube videos isn’t on the table for now. So here we are. Fingers to keyboard, thoughts to screen.</p><p class="">So what is this place? Exactly what it says on the tin: a blog. A spot to pull together the ways I play, explore, and create in games. Sometimes that means roleplay stories where characters start writing themselves. Other times it’s screenshots that capture moments I want to hold onto. And sometimes it’s just me reflecting on the gaming experience, the joy, the chaos, the little obsessions of whatever I’m into that week.</p><p class="">My gaming tastes are all over the map, and that’s how I like it. One day I’m chasing achievements in Guild Wars 2. The next I’m running delves in World of Warcraft. Or desperately trying to keep the tiny people in Frostpunk from freezing to death. If it’s a world worth exploring or a puzzle worth figuring out, odds are I’ll end up there.</p><p class="">Ready Pixel One isn’t about guides or dissecting patch notes. It’s about what happens inside the games and inside my head while I play them. It’s the spark of a new MMO story, the random character I get too attached to, the screenshots I can’t stop taking. A mix of RP stories, personal reflections, and snapshots from the journey.</p><p class="">This first post is just me setting the stage. There’s more to come, characters to meet, worlds to visit, and plenty of pixels to share along the way.</p><p class="">So… Pixel One has joined the game.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759292672837-C734CUZR5FF3N0TH5AYW/Ready+Pixel+One.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

Wuhu also sounds similar to &quot;woohoo,&quot; and this paired with &quot;goes flying&quot; would mean something like &quot;I\'m really happy.&quot; Which is stupid and funny.</p>\n<p>So anyways that concludes this stupid little post about puns.</p>\n<hr class="footnotes-sep" />\n<section class="footnotes">\n<ol class="footnotes-list">\n<li class="footnote-item" id="fn1"><p>Why do I say &quot;<em>stupid</em> puns&quot;?

Why?</p><p>I\'ll start by talking about my university days. I started as one of 108 students at that university in the chemistry department. By the time I got my diploma (masters degree), there were only 32 of us left. The other 70% had dropped out, having failed too many exams. On the other hand, we paid just 49 bucks in tuition per semester, so while we still had to pay for our cost of living and study materials, the financial burden was a lot lower. But that was in the 80\'s and 90\'s and in Germany.</p><p>Higher education has a lot fewer dropouts in the USA. The "overall status dropout rate" for high-school dropouts has gone down from 14.1% in 1976 to 5.3% in 2022.&nbsp;For colleges, between 1996 and 2017, the share of first-time, full-time students not graduating within six years fell by about 9 percentage points, from 44.6% to 35.5%. On the other hand, in the US over the last five decades, tuition cost has gone up by a factor of 4 *after* adjusting for inflation, and student loan debts are now&nbsp;the second-largest category of consumer debt after mortgages.</p><p>If you add up all those numbers, you realize something: The higher education system in the US doesn\'t treat the young people coming there as students, but rather as clients. In exchange for a rising fee, they will do their utmost to make sure you get the degree you are paying for. Educational standards be damned. On paper, that makes the US highly educated: From <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/fig_2.png" target="_blank">1940 to 2021 the percentage of population age 25+</a> without a high-school degree dropped from 75.9% to 8.9%, while the percentage of people with a bachelor\'s degree or more rose from 4.6% to 37.9%.</p><p>There are only two problems with that: The first one is that people who graduate from college in 2025 are a lot less educated than those who graduated 50 years ago. Especially over the last few years,&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/" target="_blank">AI has literally made students dumber</a>.&nbsp;One in five employed American adults with a bachelor’s degree <a href="https://www.opencampus.org/2021/06/10/a-troubling-lack-of-skills-in-literacy-and-numeracy/" target="_blank">lacks important skills in literacy, with one in three falling below proficient levels in numeracy</a>. A weird mix of economic incentives for teachers, and a belief that upholding academic standards was racist, have led to a widespread <a href="https://www.educations.com/higher-education-news/grade-inflation-in-education-a-growing-concern-for-us-students" target="_blank">US grade inflation</a>.</p><p>The second problem is that any economy only has so much use for highly educated people. If you would add a million Ph.D. level&nbsp;astrophysicists to an economy, that wouldn\'t be of much help, as most of them would end up serving fries at McDonalds.</p><p>Consider all that when you read about the jobocalypse. There are a lot of half-truths in that reporting. Have some jobs been lost to AI? Probably, but far fewer than you think. A lot of tech companies have simply hired too many people during the pandemic, and instead of admitting that, they explain their hiring freeze with AI, as that sounds better to investors. The growing unemployment numbers of college graduates have only a little to do with AI, and a lot to do with there being too many college graduates for the economy, and their actual education being of lower quality than it used to be. If you consider the US higher education system purely as a business, it is obvious that maximum throughput at maximum tuition fees produces the highest profits. The quality of the education isn\'t of much concern: You can identify the few actually brilliant people and encourage them to a career in academia, while any lack of education of the rest becomes a problem for other industries.</p><p>While higher education systems in other countries all have their own problems, they are mostly still retaining a higher percentage of meritocratic elements, and fewer business consideration. The result is on paper fewer graduates, but in reality higher education standards, and an output of people that aligns closer with the needs of industry.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': '<p>When I write about economics on this blog, I frequently write about global phenomena, like the growth of inequality, or how housing has globally become unaffordable.

Especially over the last few years,&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/" target="_blank">AI has literally made students dumber</a>.&nbsp;One in five employed American adults with a bachelor’s degree <a href="https://www.opencampus.org/2021/06/10/a-troubling-lack-of-skills-in-literacy-and-numeracy/" target="_blank">lacks important skills in literacy, with one in three falling below proficient levels in numeracy</a>. A weird mix of economic incentives for teachers, and a belief that upholding academic standards was racist, have led to a widespread <a href="https://www.educations.com/higher-education-news/grade-inflation-in-education-a-growing-concern-for-us-students" target="_blank">US grade inflation</a>.</p><p>The second problem is that any economy only has so much use for highly educated people. If you would add a million Ph.D. level&nbsp;astrophysicists to an economy, that wouldn\'t be of much help, as most of them would end up serving fries at McDonalds.</p><p>Consider all that when you read about the jobocalypse. There are a lot of half-truths in that reporting. Have some jobs been lost to AI? Probably, but far fewer than you think. A lot of tech companies have simply hired too many people during the pandemic, and instead of admitting that, they explain their hiring freeze with AI, as that sounds better to investors. The growing unemployment numbers of college graduates have only a little to do with AI, and a lot to do with there being too many college graduates for the economy, and their actual education being of lower quality than it used to be. If you consider the US higher education system purely as a business, it is obvious that maximum throughput at maximum tuition fees produces the highest profits. The quality of the education isn\'t of much concern: You can identify the few actually brilliant people and encourage them to a career in academia, while any lack of education of the rest becomes a problem for other industries.</p><p>While higher education systems in other countries all have their own problems, they are mostly still retaining a higher percentage of meritocratic elements, and fewer business consideration. The result is on paper fewer graduates, but in reality higher education standards, and an output of people that aligns closer with the needs of industry.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/5206067061090591794/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/5206067061090591794', 'title': '5 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5206067061090591794'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5206067061090591794'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/10/education-is-not-just-financial.html', 'title': 'Education is not just a financial transaction'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '5'}

Videogames are a bit different: People use other words, like complex, or "difficult to learn", to describe a game like Europa Universalis. But calling a videogame just "difficult" in the overwhelming majority of cases means only one thing: The game demanding a very fast reaction time, and you not being able to progress if you aren\'t fast enough.

If the difficulty of a game lies in its complexity, that is something that can be overcome by studying the game. But for reaction time, there is a hard cap, which is biological.

Older people have always had more money than younger people, because they had the time to accumulate wealth or experience that translates into higher salaries.

There are no official numbers, but estimates from various sources, based on various data collected by players about players.

Before the release of WoT 2.0, estimated player numbers were down to 2.5 million, and we don\'t have numbers yet how much the new version was able to revive.</div><div><br /></div><div>Declining player numbers not only pose a financial problem to Wargaming, the company running the game. It also poses a financial problem to a number of YouTube channels that have dedicated their channel to World of Tanks content. Fewer players means fewer potential viewers, which means less revenue from content creation. And of course the content creators each have their own idea why World of Tanks is declining, and frequently blame Wargaming for some decision or other. This is also somewhat typical for YouTube: If you run a channel for a game and don\'t frequently criticize the game, you will be seen as a shill. Also the occasional <i>"World of Tanks is dying"</i> sensationalist / controversial video is good for viewer numbers, as controversy gets more clicks than <i>"this is fine"</i> content.</div><div><br /></div><div>So while Wargaming was mostly concerned how to monetize the remaining players, many YouTube channels were complaining about that monetization. That went as far as some channels organizing a "boycott", in which they wouldn\'t review the tanks from loot boxes. Unsurprisingly, Wargaming wasn\'t amused, and removed content creator privileges from the YouTubers complaining the loudest. Which didn\'t make the content on YouTube about World of Tanks any more positive.</div><div><br /></div><div>World of Tanks has, and always had, a slower pace than other online shooters. Especially with heavier tanks at higher tiers and with players using terrain and cover well, a lot of shots simply didn\'t penetrate armor. Which kept tanks alive longer, and led to matches being up to 15 minutes long. Now on the one side, Wargaming felt that a faster game would attract more players. On the other side, Wargaming wanted to sell stuff to players, like premium tanks and premium ammunition. So over the years, power creep occurred: The tanks today penetrate armor a lot more often, due to players using premium "Pay2Win" features. In addition, one of the major changes in World of Tanks 2.0 is an "armor flashlight", that makes it easier for less experienced players to see where the armor of the enemy is weak and can be penetrated.</div><div><br /></div><div>Between that, and the drive to get players back, or new players into the game, veterans of World of Tanks aren\'t happy: Too many people in a typical battle aren\'t very experienced, and play in a more YOLO style, which has become more viable due to that power creep. Thus battles are now much faster, often last only around 5 minutes, and feel very different to the more careful style the veterans are used to. Thus an increasing number of World of Tank content creators are just ranting about the game these days, which doesn\'t really help to promote it, and contributes to the downward spiral. Which also reduces their own viewer numbers. A video 5 years ago from Quickybaby about the best starting tech tree got 692k views, while an equivalent video from 2 weeks ago about which free tech tree to pick only got 255k views. It is pretty obvious that the World of Tanks ecosystem is not in a good shape. The game company and the content creators all make a lot less money than a few years ago, and often blame each other for that.</div><div><br /></div><div>Undoubtedly related to declining player numbers and the resulting matchmaking problems is the fact that World of Tanks today has a lot more PvE parts than it had 5 years ago, when I played last. Today, unless you turn it off, your first battles every day are PvE battles against bots. And why would you turn that off, when you are more likely to win against bots than against real players, and you get full credits and xp for those wins, they just don\'t affect ranking. There are also a number of PvE events, and a badly defined "new player protection mode", in which new players are again more likely to face bots as enemies, or other newer players, and are protected from "seal clubbing", as the practice of veteran players farming new players for xp and credits was known.</div><div><br /></div><div>But while the increase of PvE actually makes World of Tanks more attractive to me, I don\'t think I will play WoT 2.0 a lot.

Fate is a board game by designer Matt Leacock. Matt got his breakthrough in the board game industry with Pandemic, and has since then made several board games that are variations of the Pandemic system. Z-Man Games even created a trademark for <a href="https://www.zmangames.com/universe/pandemic-system/" target="_blank">Pandemic System</a> games, and added some more games not designed by Matt. There are Pandemic System games with a World of Warcraft theme, a Fall of Rome theme, a Dutch dikes themes, a Cthulhu theme, and Star Wars theme, and now Fate joins them as a Pandemic System game with a The Lord of the Rings theme. So I wasn\'t too impressed on hearing this game being announced, it sounded a lot like yet another milking of the same old cash cow. Then I got to play the game at a board game night, and my attitude changed. I even rushed out to buy a copy.<div><br /></div><div>So, what is the Pandemic System? All games with this system are cooperative board games, where the players together struggle to hold back a growing threat. After every player move, some enemy cards are revealed that make bad things happen. If players aren\'t efficient enough to fight the threats faster than they appear, things go downhill quickly. As a special twist, at some points in the game the already played enemy cards are shuffled and put back on the <b>top</b> of the enemy deck. Which means that some enemy cards you\'ll see repeatedly, concentrating the threat locally, and others not at all.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fate adds a new twist to this system: The enemy (shadow) cards now have two different backs. When you turn over the top shadow card, the back of the next card tells you whether to apply the effect on the top or the bottom. Bottom effects put shadow troops (think orcs) into play, bottom effects move those troops in the direction of some haven. This makes the new system slightly more varied than the standard Pandemic System, and Fate just might be the best Pandemic game just from a pure game mechanics point of view.</div><div><br /></div><div>But the reason I would really recommend Fate as a board game is the theme. Which means that my recommendation is addressed to anybody who has at least a decent knowledge of The Lord of the Rings, either by having read the books, or by having seen the films, or ideally both. We played Fate once with a guy who had no clue who Gandalf was, and he still had fun, but there is a huge amount of additional fun to have if you are somewhat knowledgeable of Tolkien\'s work. On the one side, the growing threat produced by the improved Pandemic System is a perfect fit for the growing threat of Sauron in The Lord of the Rings. Also the group being split up all over the map of Middle Earth is an obvious fit to the story. On the other side of things, the game cleverly references the memorable scenes of the books / movies by turning them into quests. On my first game, I was playing Gandalf the Grey, and I had to go to Moria, confront the Balrog, and come back as Gandalf the White. There is a good selection of different quests for different characters, only Frodo having to throw the One Ring into Mount Doom is always the final quest to win the game. Playing Fate feels a lot like The Lord of the Rings, the theme is extremely well integrated into gameplay, and if you like the theme, it adds a lot to the fun of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship costs about $80, or slightly cheaper at €65 in Europe. That makes it a lot cheaper than many of the crowdfunded games I own, but still relatively expensive compared to other retail games. My main point of criticism of the game is that it includes a cardboard dice tower; that adds a lot to table presence, but it is somewhat fiddly to put together, and you have to partially disassemble it to put it back into the box. As you often only throw 3 dice or less, it seems like an unnecessary cost element to me, although some other people absolutely love that thing. I like that the characters are screen printed on wooden pieces instead of being plastic miniatures. The allied and shadow troops are a bit on the small side. But kudos to Asmodee, who without fuzz agreed to send me a replacement for a damaged dwarven troop in my copy of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>Personally I like the cooperative nature of Fate, and its variability. But there being no hidden information opens the game up to the risk of one alpha gamer trying to boss around everybody else at the table to do what he says. Fate needs cooperation, but one needs to balance that with the need for player agency. I guess it depends very much on your gaming group. A group that is working very well together can potentially play Fate at a higher player count of 4 or 5; for most groups 2 or 3 players is probably safer. Also a matter of personal preference is your acceptance of luck in a game. Random characters having to do random quests means that different games can be very different in difficulty; the random nature of the shadow cards can also produce spikes of difficulty, or just ruin your plans by a bad luck draw. On the positive side, this keeps Fate very interesting, you aren\'t going to get to a situation where you feel you have already won only half way through the game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'Winning the award for the board game with the most unwieldy title this year, I\'ll call&nbsp;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/436217/the-lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-fellowship" target="_blank">The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</a> just Fate for the rest of this post.

On the positive side, this keeps Fate very interesting, you aren\'t going to get to a situation where you feel you have already won only half way through the game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/5484888468973093854/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/5484888468973093854', 'title': '0 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5484888468973093854'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5484888468973093854'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-lord-of-rings-fate-of-fellowship.html', 'title': 'The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '0'}

They envision a future with elements from films like The Terminator, or A Space Odyssey, where AI becomes self-aware, super-intelligent, and intent on oppressing or wiping out humans. I don\'t think any of that will happen during my lifetime, armed robots simply aren\'t really a thing yet. In 2025 there is a possibility, albeit a small one, that you get killed by an AI-driven car. But we don\'t even have enough data, enough widespread adoption, and enough standardized AI driving technology that we could even say whether an AI driver kills more or less people than a human driver. The large language model generative AI from software like ChatGPT can kill people indirectly by causing mental harm, e.g. encouraging suicide, but that is still very far from a Terminator future.<div><br /></div><div>In the medium term, a much more realistic fear of AI is that of a disruption of the jobs market through artificial intelligence. The nature of work will change somewhat if companies move towards a wider adoption of AI. New jobs will emerge, but some old jobs will disappear. If you never heard anybody describing his job as "Vibe Coding Cleanup Specialist", that is because that job didn\'t exist before AI. Today it does, but the company hiring him is probably hiring fewer regular coders.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe there is a much bigger short term risk of AI, but I will have to precede my thoughts with a "this is not financial advice" disclaimer. Stock markets are at an all time high. The S&amp;P 500 is now over 40% tech stocks, and most of those tech stocks are heavily invested in artificial intelligence. There is at least a non-zero probability that there is an AI bubble, that investors overestimated the gains companies can make with AI over the coming years, and that the bubble could burst when these gains don\'t get realized as fast as they thought. How does that work?</div><div><br /></div><div>What one needs to understand is the concept of market capitalization, market cap for short. For example Nvidia has&nbsp;24.4 billion shares outstanding, and these shares today trade at $177.75. If you multiply these two numbers, you get the Nvidia market cap of $4.3 trillion. The problem with the concept is that this is imaginary money. It would be impossible to exchange 24.4 billion shares of Nvidia for $4.3 trillion in cash, because the act of selling Nvidia shares would make the share price drop. The same is true for every other share. As long as more people want to buy these shares than there are for sale, stock prices rise. As soon as people want to sell and cash in, stock prices drop. If you bought Nvidia shares on January 1st 2023 for under $15 and sell them now for $177, you made a huge profit. If you buy Nvidia shares for $177 now, and in a year the stock price dropped by half, you would lose money on selling.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fundamentally, stock prices are correlated to what investors think the future of a company will look like. Recently OpenAI made a deal with Oracle to invest $300 billion in AI data centers built by Oracle. This raised the stock price of Oracle, but also of Nvidia, where Oracle would buy the chips for those data centers. If everything in this deal happens as announced, Oracle and Nvidia are expected to have higher revenue, and thus their stock prices rose on an expectation of that. But the future is uncertain, and this optimistic expectation of the future might just be plain wrong. OpenAI is actually losing money every year, and the $300 billion would have to come from investors. And then there is the practical difficulty of buying and powering that many data centers in just a few years. Once Nvidia has made the chips, sold them to Oracle, and Oracle has built the data centers, OpenAI still needs to figure out how to turn that $300 billion investment into a profitable revenue stream. With AI adoption by non-tech companies apparently slowing down, all that future profit isn\'t obvious.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe that stock markets are failing to price in the unintended consequences of the AI boom. For example, a lot of Americans have noticed their electricity prices going up, especially in regions where data centers have been built. Electricity is a regionally traded commodity, and if a lot of new electricity consumers go live, supply doesn\'t go up as fast as demand, and prices generally rise. That is a problem for AI data center owners, but also of all other industry using electricity, and of regular households.</div><div><br /></div><div>Another "unintended" consequence of AI is more unemployment. Where do the stock markets think the profits from AI will ultimately come from? The most straightforward way for a general company to make money with AI is to replace people by it, paying less for an "AI worker" than for the person who did the same job before. But if everybody has "lower labor cost", it also means that a lot of people are unemployed or earn a lot less. And these people are the customers for the companies on the stock market. We already see companies like McDonalds struggling because many of their customers are lower income households, and can\'t afford fast food anymore. If you directly translate aggregate lower labor cost into aggregate lower consumer spending, the future for some companies on the stock market looks a lot less rosy. Those aren\'t necessarily the same companies, e.g. Oracle does very little business with low income households. But right now a glorious AI future, whether it will happen or not, has already been priced into the stock price of the companies that might gain from it, and not yet into the stock price of the companies that would be at the losing end of that deal. I don\'t see McDonalds replacing a lot of its staff by AI, as AI isn\'t yet very good at flipping burgers.</div><div><br /></div><div>Investor optimism leads to overpriced stocks.&nbsp;"Irrational exuberance" in the words of Alan Greenspan. The price to earnings ratio of Nvidia is over 50, that of Oracle over 75. The historical average P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is between 10 and 20.&nbsp;Current S&amp;P 500 PE Ratio is over 30. So the most short term risk from artificial intelligence is not some version of the Terminator, but what is politely called a "stock market correction", where investors realize that AI isn\'t going to pay out *that* fast, and stock prices drop a lot, because suddenly more people are trying to sell their overpriced AI shares than there are people wanting to buy them. And that also affects people who simply invested in ETFs, or who have money in a 401k pension plan. That is not to say that AI isn\'t a technology that will make money in the future, it just might take longer, or the profits will go to different companies than investors think today. Just like the dot com bubble burst, and the internet is doing fine, the AI bubble can burst while AI still has a bright future.

Especially games that don\'t just sell on artistic appeal, but on gameplay. We don\'t need to live in a world where half of the indie games are using pixel art. And I am sure that generative AI could also be used to turn interesting art from human artists into video game animations at much lower cost than today. I would rather see games competing on their merits on platforms like Steam without the gatekeeping of big budget artwork.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/6126267731058331676/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/6126267731058331676', 'title': '3 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6126267731058331676'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6126267731058331676'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-gatekeeping-of-big-budgets.html', 'title': 'The gatekeeping of big budgets'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '3'}

Not the chance to get struck by lightning, it is around that number, although it obviously depends a lot on where and how you live. A link between carrying a mobile phone and getting cancer has been discussed, but the chance to get cancer is higher than the chance to get struck by lightning, and the possible increase to that chance is so low as to be considered not scientifically proven. Right now, in the EU official classification, mobile phones are in the same category of increased cancer risk as pickles.

This week in the news is a possible link between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and the child being born with autism. In the United States the probability of a child being born with autism is estimated to be 1 in 36. That is certainly higher than a century ago, but it is unclear whether this is due to external factors like Tylenol, or simply to an increased awareness of autism. Now there are scientific studies that link Tylenol to autism, and there are scientific studies that show no such link. Just as there are scientific studies that link glyphosate to&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and there being scientific studies that show no such link.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The difference now being that these things have been politicised, and in the USA a Republican would be more likely to believe in the link between Tylenol and autism, while a Democrat would be more likely to believe in the link between glyphosate and&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It should be obvious that this isn\'t how probability or science works. But humans are notoriously bad with probabilities. And thus anything that science would consider to be an event of low probability can find its way into our belief systems. If you thought my example of a mobile phone getting you struck by lightning was ridiculous, how about the belief that it was your sins that would get you struck by lightning? That was pretty wide spread in humanity over many different cultures and religions. And our belief systems are evolving away from being religious to being political. Especially in two-party systems like the USA, party affiliation today has a stronger influence on what you believe to be true than your religious affiliation.</div><div><br /></div><div>For all questions of "does product X causes undesirable outcome Y", I would urge you to consider that whatever you read might be a result of political bias. You still should ask the relevant scientific question of how high the probability of undesirable outcome X is with and without product X. How strong or weak is the link? If the probability is relatively high to start with, and increases only by a small amount, how justified would it be to sue the producer of product X for damages? Although in a legal system where the probability of getting over 1 million dollars in a lawsuit is higher than the probability of winning 1 million dollars in the lottery, scientific proof is maybe the last thing you want.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'Imagine that your probability of getting struck by lightning is 1 in a million in a given year.

Just as there are scientific studies that link glyphosate to&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and there being scientific studies that show no such link.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The difference now being that these things have been politicised, and in the USA a Republican would be more likely to believe in the link between Tylenol and autism, while a Democrat would be more likely to believe in the link between glyphosate and&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It should be obvious that this isn\'t how probability or science works. But humans are notoriously bad with probabilities. And thus anything that science would consider to be an event of low probability can find its way into our belief systems. If you thought my example of a mobile phone getting you struck by lightning was ridiculous, how about the belief that it was your sins that would get you struck by lightning? That was pretty wide spread in humanity over many different cultures and religions. And our belief systems are evolving away from being religious to being political. Especially in two-party systems like the USA, party affiliation today has a stronger influence on what you believe to be true than your religious affiliation.</div><div><br /></div><div>For all questions of "does product X causes undesirable outcome Y", I would urge you to consider that whatever you read might be a result of political bias. You still should ask the relevant scientific question of how high the probability of undesirable outcome X is with and without product X. How strong or weak is the link? If the probability is relatively high to start with, and increases only by a small amount, how justified would it be to sue the producer of product X for damages? Although in a legal system where the probability of getting over 1 million dollars in a lawsuit is higher than the probability of winning 1 million dollars in the lottery, scientific proof is maybe the last thing you want.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/4166210046328438336/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/4166210046328438336', 'title': '6 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/4166210046328438336'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/4166210046328438336'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/science-probability-and-political-bias.html', 'title': 'Science, probability and political bias'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '6'}

In the first story mission we ended up in a situation where we were boxed in and couldn\'t move, and as it took several rounds to kill an enemy we had a series of rather boring turns. The second and third story mission we both lost, and couldn\'t replay because of the fail forward system. In both those mission the objective tokens were randomly distributed on the map, and we just had bad luck of them being in the worst possible spots in both cases.

It does not help you to know that at the start of EU4 it is a possible strategy to give away all your crownland to the estates in exchange for one monarch point per category per month, as EU5 doesn\'t even have monarch points. It is very likely that EU5 will have some systems in place that address the same fundamentals, e.g. a system that prevents you from having too many alliances.

Games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild / Tears of the Kingdom have relatively open worlds, but still provide the player with a clear path of progression and a main story line. That might actually be an optimum. If you get much more open, the player is increasingly likely to feel somewhat lost and aimless. It is a lot easier to follow a set of goals that is prescribed by the game than to set your own goals and follow those.<div><br /></div><div>I very much like the board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420033/vantage" target="_blank">Vantage</a> that recently came out. Having a lot of fun playing that occasionally with my wife, played some solo, and brought it several times to board game night. But Vantage sure isn\'t for everybody. Dice Tower made a video review, in which 2 of the 4 reviewers rated it very highly, while the 2 others didn\'t want to play that game again. As a game in which you follow the goals set by the game to win, Vantage doesn\'t work very well. It is more of a very open sandbox game in which you have to pursue your own goals, and the missions and destinies are just sprinkled in as optional content. If you get the concept of "winning" out of your head, Vantage becomes a much better game.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was thinking about that when reading the Reddit discussion on Europa Universalis V. One of the big changes from EU4 to EU5 is that the mission trees that are currently in EU4 have been abandoned. People liked the mission trees, because they provided a clear path to victory. On the one side they gave you specific goals to pursue, on the other side they rewarded you with bonuses, often in the form of permanent claims, that helped you on the way to the next goal. The downside of that is that the mission tree turns a country into a nearly linear experience towards winning the game. And winning Europa Universalis isn\'t much fun to begin with.</div><div><br /></div><div>I recently had a very weird game in which I wanted to try to play France for the first time. But having played countries nearby, and watched some videos, I was well aware of the two major events that happen to France, and the French mission tree. So by maximum use of the advance knowledge and a bit of luck I first exploited the Surrender of Maine event to crush England, and then finagled my way into the Burgundian Succession. Then when the Holy Roman Empire demanded the lowlands, I refused, and crushed Austria. Shortly after Marie of Burgundy had her "riding accident" event, and Burgundy got integrated into France. I also integrated all the apanages. Before I even reached the year 1500, my main problem was that the game couldn\'t find any other rival than Spain for me, I had simply grown too strong too fast. I stopped playing, because it got boring. I know that some people play EU4 with a goal of world conquest, but once you are already the strongest nation, that is just boring to me. I might play France again and just pretend I don\'t know about the events that will happen with England and Burgundy.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the EU4 mission trees telling you how to win and helping you with it, the devs from Paradox decided to not provide such a clear path towards victory for the countries in Europa Universalis V. From all I see, I believe that EU5, like Vantage, will best played without thinking of winning. It could be a lot of fun as an alternative history simulation game. But the different countries you can choose are clearly not equally strong, and very soon people will learn how to conquer the world, especially when starting with a stronger nation. I\'m not sure that will be fun to me, I don\'t rate the combat system of Europa Universalis high enough that I would want to play it as a war game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'A lot of games which people think of as being sandboxes in fact aren\'t. Games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild / Tears of the Kingdom have relatively open worlds, but still provide the player with a clear path of progression and a main story line. That might actually be an optimum. If you get much more open, the player is increasingly likely to feel somewhat lost and aimless. It is a lot easier to follow a set of goals that is prescribed by the game than to set your own goals and follow those.<div><br /></div><div>I very much like the board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420033/vantage" target="_blank">Vantage</a> that recently came out. Having a lot of fun playing that occasionally with my wife, played some solo, and brought it several times to board game night. But Vantage sure isn\'t for everybody. Dice Tower made a video review, in which 2 of the 4 reviewers rated it very highly, while the 2 others didn\'t want to play that game again. As a game in which you follow the goals set by the game to win, Vantage doesn\'t work very well. It is more of a very open sandbox game in which you have to pursue your own goals, and the missions and destinies are just sprinkled in as optional content. If you get the concept of "winning" out of your head, Vantage becomes a much better game.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was thinking about that when reading the Reddit discussion on Europa Universalis V. One of the big changes from EU4 to EU5 is that the mission trees that are currently in EU4 have been abandoned. People liked the mission trees, because they provided a clear path to victory. On the one side they gave you specific goals to pursue, on the other side they rewarded you with bonuses, often in the form of permanent claims, that helped you on the way to the next goal. The downside of that is that the mission tree turns a country into a nearly linear experience towards winning the game. And winning Europa Universalis isn\'t much fun to begin with.</div><div><br /></div><div>I recently had a very weird game in which I wanted to try to play France for the first time. But having played countries nearby, and watched some videos, I was well aware of the two major events that happen to France, and the French mission tree. So by maximum use of the advance knowledge and a bit of luck I first exploited the Surrender of Maine event to crush England, and then finagled my way into the Burgundian Succession. Then when the Holy Roman Empire demanded the lowlands, I refused, and crushed Austria. Shortly after Marie of Burgundy had her "riding accident" event, and Burgundy got integrated into France. I also integrated all the apanages. Before I even reached the year 1500, my main problem was that the game couldn\'t find any other rival than Spain for me, I had simply grown too strong too fast. I stopped playing, because it got boring. I know that some people play EU4 with a goal of world conquest, but once you are already the strongest nation, that is just boring to me. I might play France again and just pretend I don\'t know about the events that will happen with England and Burgundy.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the EU4 mission trees telling you how to win and helping you with it, the devs from Paradox decided to not provide such a clear path towards victory for the countries in Europa Universalis V. From all I see, I believe that EU5, like Vantage, will best played without thinking of winning. It could be a lot of fun as an alternative history simulation game. But the different countries you can choose are clearly not equally strong, and very soon people will learn how to conquer the world, especially when starting with a stronger nation.

You worked until a certain age, collected a gold watch and a farewell dinner, and then stepped into a quieter life of golf courses, morning walks, and long vacations. Retirement meant stopping. It meant putting down the tools and closing the office door for good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the closer I get to that stage, the more I realize that picture doesn’t fit. Stopping entirely isn’t the goal. In fact, what excites me isn’t the idea of doing nothing, but the freedom to reshape what I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask if I’m thinking about retiring, what they really mean is leaving my demanding corporate role. And yes, I think about it often. But stepping away from one kind of work doesn’t mean I want to stop working altogether. It means shifting the balance, redistributing my energy toward the things that matter most in this season of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, that might look like helping a company in a smaller, more flexible capacity. It might look like writing. It might look like mentoring younger professionals. It might even look like teaching college accounting, something I’ve often thought would be both meaningful and energizing. It will certainly mean being more available for family, especially as my youngest child sets out on his own path. Retirement, as I’ve come to define it, is less about leaving the game and more about choosing a different table.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-75" height="1024" src="https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is freedom in that redefinition. When you stop thinking of retirement as an on-off switch, you open up the possibility of many in-between stages. You can move from full-throttle to part-time, from demanding to flexible, from career-driven to purpose-driven. That spectrum allows for contribution without burnout, for learning without pressure, for presence without constant distraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I notice among friends and peers is that those who thrive after retirement don’t stop being useful. They simply redirect. Some become deeply involved in community work. Others launch second careers in entirely different fields. Some finally give attention to long-neglected passions, whether it’s music, art, or volunteering. The common thread is not absence of work but freedom in the kind of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, redefining retirement requires courage. Our culture still measures worth by productivity and titles. Walking away from the familiar markers of success feels risky, even when you know it’s the right move. But the deeper risk is clinging to an outdated definition of retirement and missing the chance to live a more balanced, meaningful chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t see retirement as the end of usefulness. I see it as the chance to redefine it. To trade in endless urgency for chosen commitments. To replace old demands with new rhythms. To measure value less by output and more by alignment with who you are becoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So no, I am not looking forward to stopping. I am looking forward to reshaping. Retirement, for me, is not a finish line. It is a redesign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And maybe that’s what it has always been meant to be.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/2025/09/22/redefining-retirement/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce6ab42cff977c9257c629feb9e6564cb5af44230695b42e3fdeaac8ee32f59?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2.png?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

But I’ve come to realize that change is just as much about geography. Where we are, and where we’re headed, shapes who we become.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve lived in Ohio for the past twenty years. Its seasons are familiar, its rhythms steady. There’s comfort in the known: the streets you’ve driven for decades, the community that recognizes your face, the office where you can almost walk the halls with your eyes closed. For a long time, I thought of that stability as the backdrop to my story. But lately, I’ve begun to wonder if geography isn’t just the backdrop. It’s part of the script.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-68" height="1024" src="https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Change often starts as a pull toward somewhere else. For me, that somewhere else is Texas. My son will likely be heading to Texas A&amp;M next year, and the prospect of relocating has shifted from hypothetical to something I can feel in my bones. It’s more than a change of scenery. It’s a chance to step into a new rhythm, a new set of habits, even a new version of myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places carry identity. Ohio has given me steadiness, community, and a deep sense of rootedness. Texas, I imagine, will bring openness, expansion, and the possibility of reinvention. Geography can do that. It can pull you into different versions of yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, leaving is never simple. Change means saying goodbye not just to people and places but to the versions of ourselves tied to them. In Ohio, I’ve been the finance leader, the steady hand, the one others count on to navigate complex systems. In Texas, I will not automatically be that. The geography of change strips away old assumptions and asks you to rebuild. That is both unsettling and liberating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve started to think of life as a map with two layers. One layer is the internal map, the values, relationships, and commitments that guide us wherever we are. The other is the external map, the literal geography of cities, communities, and opportunities. When they align, you feel at home. When they don’t, you feel restless.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-66" height="1024" src="https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So much of adulthood is learning to redraw the map. Careers shift. Families grow and scatter. Health and circumstance demand detours. Each move reshapes the landscape, but it also reshapes us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know exactly what Texas will hold, but I do know this: geography matters. And sometimes the surest way to change isn’t to wait for time to work its slow process. It’s to change your place, your view, your horizon line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the geography of change is also the geography of becoming.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/2025/09/17/the-geography-of-change/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce6ab42cff977c9257c629feb9e6564cb5af44230695b42e3fdeaac8ee32f59?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1.png?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.png?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

That’s often the signal: it’s time to push the chair back, thank the dealer, and step away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been thinking about that a lot lately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most of my career, I’ve been seated at the finance table. The stakes were high, the pace relentless, and for a long time, I thrived on it. Complex deals, leadership responsibilities, deadlines that left no room for error — those were challenges I was proud to take on. But over time, the thrill has shifted. What once felt like the right game has started to feel like the wrong table.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reading the Signals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The signs don’t come with fireworks. They creep in slowly:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>Diminishing returns.</strong> I can still do the work, and do it well, but the energy it takes doesn’t leave much left over.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Competing priorities.</strong> Family calls more loudly than balance sheets. My son will likely be heading off to college in Texas next year, and I want to be present in that transition — not buried under late-night calls and endless travel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identity shift.</strong> I’ve carried titles and responsibilities for decades, but lately I’ve been asking myself a different question: what do I want the next chapter of my life to be about?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These aren’t signs of failure. They’re markers of growth. They’re the reminder that a career is just one kind of table, and that life is bigger than any single game.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Fear of Folding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, leaving isn’t easy. For years, work has been a big part of my identity. Stepping back can feel like walking away from something I’ve built. There’s a voice that whispers, <em>Are you sure?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here’s the paradox: staying too long can be its own kind of loss. In poker, clinging to a hand past its value erodes your winnings. In life, it erodes your energy, your relationships, your health, your chance to explore what else might be possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I’m trying to reframe the choice. It’s not quitting; it’s reallocating. It’s choosing to invest my time, attention, and presence where the returns are higher — whether that’s in family, in writing, in mentoring, or simply being more present for the people I love.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Leaving Well, Beginning Again</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the time comes to leave, leaving well matters. That means preparing others to step in, honoring what the work has given me, and closing the loop with respect. But it also means not rushing to fill the silence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the truth is, there’s always another table. Some tables will look like work. Others might look like learning, creating, or just savoring life in a new place. For me, that may soon mean a fresh start in Texas, surrounded by new rhythms and different stakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision isn’t about whether to leave <em>a</em> table — it’s about whether you’re ready to choose the right one for the season you’re in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is stand up, step back, and trust that the next seat you take will be the one that fits who you’re becoming.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/2025/09/09/when-is-it-time-to-leave-the-table/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce6ab42cff977c9257c629feb9e6564cb5af44230695b42e3fdeaac8ee32f59?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

which he seemed to enjoy and was pretty good at.\u2002It has also limited his ability to do breaststroke going into swim season, but we&#8217;ll see if that eventually comes back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the work front, this was my first full year in my new role, which is more of a business unit finance role instead of my previous corporate controller / treasurer role.\u2002I&#8217;m more of a technical accountant by nature, so I&#8217;m still not the biggest fan of the new position.\u2002It generally requires more travel, which I&#8217;m not able to do because of my wife&#8217;s health issues.\u2002So that has been a challenge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My wife and I finished out the year by taking a short 3-day cruise to the Bahamas.\u2002It was the 5th or 6th cruise we&#8217;ve been on, mostly because my wife&#8217;s parents are big cruise people.\u2002I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;ll ever do one again.\u2002This was the last use of funds for a cruise that we had scheduled with the kids for spring break right when the pandemic started.\u2002We had a generally good time and a fantastic stateroom, but probably not something we&#8217;ll do again.\u2002We had a very disappointing excursion on the second day in Nassau, and that probably soured the experience a little bit.\u2003</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-51" height="1024" src="https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_0827.jpeg?w=768" width="768" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I also got roped into taking over Treasurer duties for my youngest&#8217;s high school water polo and swim teams.\u2002It&#8217;s significantly more work than I was expecting, so I&#8217;ve had to back off of a few other things that I&#8217;m involved in.\u2002I&#8217;ve stopped officiating swimming almost completely and also resigned from the Ohio Swimming Board.\u2002In addition to the high school teams, I&#8217;m also serving as the CFO of my youngest&#8217;s club team, and serving on the board of two local charities &#8211; Recreation Unlimited, which runs camps for children with disabilities, and Star House, a local drop in center for homeless youth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the last big activity during 2023 was continuing to work on my Master&#8217;s degree.\u2002I&#8217;m taking an online Masters of Accounting program through the University of Illinois.\u2002During 2023, I had courses in Management Accounting, Tax and Auditing.\u2002I&#8217;ll be finishing the degree up this spring.\u2002I&#8217;m taking the program because it&#8217;s a credential that I need in order to teach accounting at local universities, something I&#8217;d like to start doing as I approach retirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the year-in-review.\u2002Quite a bit going on.\u2002My hope is to begin posting in this space on various personal musings at least once a week, much like I do with the gaming blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/2024/01/02/2023-year-in-review/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce6ab42cff977c9257c629feb9e6564cb5af44230695b42e3fdeaac8ee32f59?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_0240.png?w=473', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/53262767781_17b3f0de94_o.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_0581.jpg?w=768', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_0827.jpeg?w=768', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I am terrified by what I see as a potential rise of fascism and authoritarianism but especially by the further fracturing of an already divided country.  And I wonder how much of this is the results of external actors trying to force just such a division.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me start by explaining that when you look up white privilege in the Urban Dictionary, there&#8217;s probably a picture of me or some asshole that looks a lot like me.  There&#8217;s a story about my day yesterday that probably sums this up perfectly.  A group is apparently planning to protest my country club today, but I won&#8217;t be able to be there, because I have a Board meeting for the multi-billion dollar public company that I work for.  Yeah, I&#8217;m that kind of dick head.  My country club has members from a variety of minority groups and has always been completely welcoming, but we definitely project the image of a bunch of rich white assholes.  And the reality is that we probably are 85% rich white asshole, but so is the community that I live in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also a pretty liberal guy for a rich white older guy.  Enough so that other members of the senior leadership team at my large public company sometimes feel uncomfortable around me.  They don&#8217;t necessarily like what Trump says or some of the things he does, but they think the things he has done for business are awesome.  I believe in racial justice, in economic equality.  I believe there should be free healthcare for everyone, free college and free day care / preschool.  And I&#8217;d love to be out there supporting the folks that are voicing their outrage and demanding justice, but I also feel like they&#8217;re going to take one look at me and tell me to go home, sit my privileged ass down, shut the fuck up and maybe do some reading or some donating to help their causes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of what I&#8217;m also struggling with is I&#8217;m also questioning the credibility of everything I see.  Everyone has an agenda and that agenda is often being manipulated by algorithms and outside actors that I barely even understanding, influencing what I see on social media and in the news.  I feel like the days where there were a few fairly objective sources of news that you could really trust are long behind us.  Maybe I was just naive then, but I really felt like Walter Cronkite wasn&#8217;t feeding me a line of bullshit.  Even for a self-professed liberal such as myself, I&#8217;ll acknowledge that both the NY Times and the Washington Post are often bringing a slanted perspective and agenda to things.  I feel like NPR remains fairly objective, but I also am confident that my conservative friends would tell me I&#8217;m nuts.  So I struggle with even understanding how much of what I see is true or twisted and taken out of context, by either side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with all that as context, right now I am terrified by what is going on here and in other places around the world.  And that terror is almost immobilizing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in no particular order, here are a few of my thoughts right now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>There is no question that we have a lot of police forces in this country right now where systemic racism is a severe problem.  I&#8217;m not saying that all cops are bad or even necessarily that most of them are bad.  The images from places like Flint clearly show there are good folks out there in blue.  But there are serious problems with police in a huge number of our major metropolitan areas that have needed to be addressed for decades.  We need to stop militarizing our police forces and begin holding them accountable to the same standard we would anyone else when people die or are injured at their hands.</li><li>We need real leadership in the country right now.  I frankly don&#8217;t give a shit if that leadership is Republican or Democrat.  We just need someone that can provide guidance and leadership in a crisis and work to unite, not to divide.  I&#8217;ve said this before on my Twitter feed, but I strongly believe that you could draw five names out of a hat at random and have those five people lead the country for four years, and they&#8217;d do a better job than many of our Presidents of the last century.</li><li>I&#8217;m going to talk in a future post about tribalism and polarization, or at least refer everyone to a really good book that Ezra Klein wrote recently on this topic, but part of the issue that keeps us from being able to reach solutions is the tribalism and us versus them mentality that divides our political system right now.  Neither of our political parties are about ideology right now.  It&#8217;s about making sure the other guy loses and continues to lose at all costs.  That&#8217;s clearly not working and we need to figure out how to undo that in order to move forward.  When the parties were less polarized in the past, it had more to do with racism than it being &#8220;the good old days&#8221;.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>My country feels broken to me right now.  I hear cries for freedom that feel synonymous with an embrace of ignorance.  And it&#8217;s really only freedom for white people, because when people of color come forward with the same cry, we respond with tear gas and rubber bullets.  The part that people are only starting to figure out, is it&#8217;s really just about freedom for rich white people.  For the person working multiple jobs and still struggling to make ends meet, I&#8217;m not sure how much freedom that really is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> So here is what this privileged white dick head is going to do for now.  I&#8217;ve ordered a bunch of copies of a couple of good books that I&#8217;ve seen recommended.  One is &#8220;Me and White Supremacy:  Combat Racism, Change the World, and Become a Good Ancestor&#8221; by Layla Saad.  Another is &#8220;How to Be an Antiracist&#8221; by Ibram Kendi.  I&#8217;m reading one of each and donating the rest to my local library.  I&#8217;m also donating to some organizations supporting Black Lives Matter.  I&#8217;ve always been a card carrying member of the ACLU, and I&#8217;ll be increasing my donations there and also adding donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, the Black Visions Collective and Campaign Zero.  People smarter than me that I respect on these topics have recommended these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More to come on these pages.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/2020/06/03/thoughts-from-a-privileged-white-asshole/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce6ab42cff977c9257c629feb9e6564cb5af44230695b42e3fdeaac8ee32f59?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

If you\'re quick you could be the fifth person ever to see it!</p><p>I expect people not to watch the videos. Hardly anyone ever does. I can see how many times they\'ve been viewed on <i>YouTube </i>(And yes, I checked, and watching it on the blog does increment the YouTube counter.).

Most posts stop picking up views after that although there can obviously be spikes at any time.<p></p><p>At this point, you\'re probably expecting me to say page views went up during Blaugust. That\'s always been the conventional wisdom and with this year having a record number of participants <i>and </i>with me consistently linking every post in the Blaugust Discord, it\'s more than reasonable to imagine it would hold true.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn\'t, though, or not for me. Most years I see little or no uptick in views from Blaugust and this year was much the same. Until the last week, that is.&nbsp;</p><p>From the 25th of August, page views almost doubled, averaging around seven or eight hundred. That bump carried on long after Blaugust ended and indeed became more pronounced as September went on, with quite a few posts hitting four figures, topping out at just over two thousand.</p><p>Why? No idea. I rarely have any clue why these things happen. And equally, I have no explanation for why they stop, which seems to be what\'s happened now. Only this time the drop is as spectacular as the rise was.</p><p>Generally, any post I put up gets most of its views in the first 24-48 hours, as you\'d expect. I haven\'t been keeping track but I\'m fairly sure back when they were finishing up with&nbsp; three or four hundred views, they\'d have seen half of those in the first two or three days.</p><p>The last two posts have so far managed 45 views in two days and 34 in 24 hours respectively. That doesn\'t seem normal to me, which is why this morning I started fiddling about in Google\'s stat cupboards to see if I could figure out what was going on.</p><p>I\'ll put you out of your suspense now. I did not figure out what was going on. I have no way of knowing whether regular readers have suddenly found better things to do or if Google has started tallying things differently. I\'ll just wait for it to change again, which it will.</p><p>I did, however, discover some other new and quite interesting things while I was rummaging and that\'s how this post came about.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/s1033/insights1.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="316" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/w400-h316/insights1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Firstly, I\'ll say that <i><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Google Search Console</span></a></i> is a huge improvement on Analytics for the casual user. If you have a Blogger blog, I\'d recommend giving it a look. It\'s much clearer, far&nbsp;easier to understand, and best of all it explains what the stats mean. You can set filters and use them to dig out some quite useful detail without a great deal of trouble.<p></p><p>I particularly liked the new <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/16308503"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Insights Report</span></a>, which gives you a very clear indication of which of your posts are trending up or down and enough granularity to take a shot at figuring out why. And that\'s where I noticed something very odd.</p><p>It wasn\'t that there\'d been a big spike in search requests for my post on housing in <i>Throne and Liberty</i>, which I put up just under a year ago. <i>T&amp;L</i> has just added housing so obviously people are googling for information on it, none of which they\'re going to find here.</p><p>It\'s harder to explain why there\'s been a surge of interest in <i>Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt</i>. If anything new is happening there, I\'ve missed it. Two of my posts about it do turn up on the first page of Google Search results though, so I guess if anyone is still interested, they might well give me a look.</p><p>The one that really set me thinking, though, was the sudden interest in&nbsp;<a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/09/stardust-memories-and-other-short.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">this post</span></a> from just over a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s a "<i>What I\'ve Been Listening To Lately</i>" post. No-one reads those. Okay, some people do, but clearly that series isn\'t going to come up in a general search very often. Yes, they do often have the names of famous people in the body of the post but hardly ever in the title and let\'s be realistic here - even putting <i>Taylor Swift</i>\'s name in the title of your blog post is not going to get you onto the first hundred pages on a search result, is it? I mean, there\'s a lot of competition there...</p><p>In the case of this particular post, I didn\'t mention Taylor Swift in the title (Although <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5URefVYaJrA"><span style="color: #04ff00;">A$AP Rocky\'s Taylor Swif </span></a></i>is one the featured tunes.) or anyone even close to being that famous. I did, as it happens, mention the name of a <i>Woody Allen </i>movie that doesn\'t even feature in the post at all, but that\'s not what people were searching for.</p><p>They were looking for a band called <i>X-Cetra,</i> a bunch of Californian tweenage girls who made a very odd album by the name of <i>Stardust </i>a couple of decades ago. I said in the post that X-Cetra didn\'t even have a Wikipedia page. I just checked and they still don\'t. I guess that explains why someone would bother to click through to a blog that mentioned them.</p><p>And they have. Not in the kind of numbers that click through to check on posts about clothes or housing in <i>Once Human</i>, which seem to be by far the biggest draw here over the last twelve months, but in numbers that feel statistically significant, especially since most of them appear to have happened not when I put the post up last year but in this last month.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/s1180/x-cetra%202.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="368" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/w640-h368/x-cetra%202.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>In fact, my top search query for September is "<i>X-cetra stardust</i>" and two more variations of the phrase are also in the top ten. Altogether, there were 829 searches for X-Cetra Stardust in the last 28 days and twenty-nine people clicked through to look at the page in full. It may not sound like a great conversion rate but in comparison, of more than a thousand inquiries about housing in Throne &amp; Liberty, only nine people clicked.</p><p>What\'s even more interesting is that, of the 39 clicks from search the post has ever received, 38 of them were in the last month. There was a huge spike (Seven clicks!) on 3 September and it\'s been ticking away ever since.</p><p>If there\'s been any general news about the album or the band, I\'m not aware of it. Google Trends does confirm a huge spike of interest on 3 September but a general search finds nothing special.</p><p>Enter Blaugustian <i>Calishat </i>with their invaluable selection of search refinement tools. With the inestimable <i><a href="https://searchtweaks.com/back-that-ask-up.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Back That Ask Up</span></a></i> utility I was able to narrow my search down to the exact moment of the spike and find the reason for it - an article in&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone</i>&nbsp;entitled "<span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/x-cetra-stardust-album-kids-story-1235418348/"><i>Four Best Friends Made an Album as Kids. 25 Years Later, It’s a Cult Classic</i></a></span>"</p><p>It\'s a big article with lots of new information. It even links to a "<i><a href="https://loki23.blogspot.com/2006/06/x-cetra_28.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Blogspot User</span></a></i>", sadly not me. I bet they got some page views that day. I just got the spill-over.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait. There\'s more.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given the paucity of information on the band, my post does appear on the first page of Google search results, but you have to scroll down a fair way. The thing that amazed me and led to this post, though, is what I saw at the top of the page.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s in the image up there at the head of this post. That\'s a screenshot of the top of a Google search page, the bit I rarely look at. I almost always scroll straight past all of the featured links and the AI summaries to the point where the old school listings start and go from there.</p><p>In the middle, with the eye-catching thumbnail of <i>Teri Gender Bender</i> from <i>Le Butcherettes</i>, is a link to my post. Why I\'m getting that prime spot rather than, say, the Rolling Stone article, I have no idea but I\'ll happily take it.&nbsp;</p><p>That big panel across the top of the results seems only to appear if you search for specific entity by name. It works for bands, albums, movies, actors, games... As soon as you add any detail to the query, though, it vanishes. Has it always been there? I guess I hardly ever search for anything purely by name so I would very rarely see it.&nbsp;</p><p>I might have to&nbsp; pay it more attention, now I discover that one of my posts has been featured that way. I guess it proves you don\'t have to pay to get featured on Google search, at least.</p><p>And after all that, I guess my extremely late for Blaugust advice on how to get more page views and clicks would have to be write about very obscure things no-one else is covering or clothes and housing in online games. That\'s what seems to be working for me, anyway.</p><p>For a given value of "<i>working</i>", that is. A very, very tiny one.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUxG9Ma1NWHR_5gXbH5rvuUtjZorN_Klzi1nO7VTGqh1ib5YJ2ztC9a0Krz7yZRQU-ELugUy_nRzjJ_pV66j8jXXhVl3M5LtkT2BJ0eFw9ZouA1Mka7nsgzGz7IoSo_xdfReDThbu7tessxVMUVPUu4CojTbIqW_X1uEfUNlsqyyzVZQee4_kC4uv29xQ/s1482/xcetragoogle1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="386" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUxG9Ma1NWHR_5gXbH5rvuUtjZorN_Klzi1nO7VTGqh1ib5YJ2ztC9a0Krz7yZRQU-ELugUy_nRzjJ_pV66j8jXXhVl3M5LtkT2BJ0eFw9ZouA1Mka7nsgzGz7IoSo_xdfReDThbu7tessxVMUVPUu4CojTbIqW_X1uEfUNlsqyyzVZQee4_kC4uv29xQ/w640-h386/xcetragoogle1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />Who\'s up for some blogging about blogging?

I\'ll just wait for it to change again, which it will.</p><p>I did, however, discover some other new and quite interesting things while I was rummaging and that\'s how this post came about.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/s1033/insights1.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="316" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/w400-h316/insights1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Firstly, I\'ll say that <i><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Google Search Console</span></a></i> is a huge improvement on Analytics for the casual user. If you have a Blogger blog, I\'d recommend giving it a look. It\'s much clearer, far&nbsp;easier to understand, and best of all it explains what the stats mean. You can set filters and use them to dig out some quite useful detail without a great deal of trouble.<p></p><p>I particularly liked the new <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/16308503"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Insights Report</span></a>, which gives you a very clear indication of which of your posts are trending up or down and enough granularity to take a shot at figuring out why. And that\'s where I noticed something very odd.</p><p>It wasn\'t that there\'d been a big spike in search requests for my post on housing in <i>Throne and Liberty</i>, which I put up just under a year ago. <i>T&amp;L</i> has just added housing so obviously people are googling for information on it, none of which they\'re going to find here.</p><p>It\'s harder to explain why there\'s been a surge of interest in <i>Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt</i>. If anything new is happening there, I\'ve missed it. Two of my posts about it do turn up on the first page of Google Search results though, so I guess if anyone is still interested, they might well give me a look.</p><p>The one that really set me thinking, though, was the sudden interest in&nbsp;<a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/09/stardust-memories-and-other-short.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">this post</span></a> from just over a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s a "<i>What I\'ve Been Listening To Lately</i>" post. No-one reads those. Okay, some people do, but clearly that series isn\'t going to come up in a general search very often. Yes, they do often have the names of famous people in the body of the post but hardly ever in the title and let\'s be realistic here - even putting <i>Taylor Swift</i>\'s name in the title of your blog post is not going to get you onto the first hundred pages on a search result, is it? I mean, there\'s a lot of competition there...</p><p>In the case of this particular post, I didn\'t mention Taylor Swift in the title (Although <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5URefVYaJrA"><span style="color: #04ff00;">A$AP Rocky\'s Taylor Swif </span></a></i>is one the featured tunes.) or anyone even close to being that famous. I did, as it happens, mention the name of a <i>Woody Allen </i>movie that doesn\'t even feature in the post at all, but that\'s not what people were searching for.</p><p>They were looking for a band called <i>X-Cetra,</i> a bunch of Californian tweenage girls who made a very odd album by the name of <i>Stardust </i>a couple of decades ago. I said in the post that X-Cetra didn\'t even have a Wikipedia page. I just checked and they still don\'t. I guess that explains why someone would bother to click through to a blog that mentioned them.</p><p>And they have. Not in the kind of numbers that click through to check on posts about clothes or housing in <i>Once Human</i>, which seem to be by far the biggest draw here over the last twelve months, but in numbers that feel statistically significant, especially since most of them appear to have happened not when I put the post up last year but in this last month.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/s1180/x-cetra%202.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="368" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/w640-h368/x-cetra%202.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>In fact, my top search query for September is "<i>X-cetra stardust</i>" and two more variations of the phrase are also in the top ten. Altogether, there were 829 searches for X-Cetra Stardust in the last 28 days and twenty-nine people clicked through to look at the page in full. It may not sound like a great conversion rate but in comparison, of more than a thousand inquiries about housing in Throne &amp; Liberty, only nine people clicked.</p><p>What\'s even more interesting is that, of the 39 clicks from search the post has ever received, 38 of them were in the last month. There was a huge spike (Seven clicks!) on 3 September and it\'s been ticking away ever since.</p><p>If there\'s been any general news about the album or the band, I\'m not aware of it. Google Trends does confirm a huge spike of interest on 3 September but a general search finds nothing special.</p><p>Enter Blaugustian <i>Calishat </i>with their invaluable selection of search refinement tools. With the inestimable <i><a href="https://searchtweaks.com/back-that-ask-up.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Back That Ask Up</span></a></i> utility I was able to narrow my search down to the exact moment of the spike and find the reason for it - an article in&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone</i>&nbsp;entitled "<span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/x-cetra-stardust-album-kids-story-1235418348/"><i>Four Best Friends Made an Album as Kids. 25 Years Later, It’s a Cult Classic</i></a></span>"</p><p>It\'s a big article with lots of new information. It even links to a "<i><a href="https://loki23.blogspot.com/2006/06/x-cetra_28.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Blogspot User</span></a></i>", sadly not me. I bet they got some page views that day. I just got the spill-over.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait. There\'s more.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given the paucity of information on the band, my post does appear on the first page of Google search results, but you have to scroll down a fair way. The thing that amazed me and led to this post, though, is what I saw at the top of the page.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s in the image up there at the head of this post. That\'s a screenshot of the top of a Google search page, the bit I rarely look at. I almost always scroll straight past all of the featured links and the AI summaries to the point where the old school listings start and go from there.</p><p>In the middle, with the eye-catching thumbnail of <i>Teri Gender Bender</i> from <i>Le Butcherettes</i>, is a link to my post. Why I\'m getting that prime spot rather than, say, the Rolling Stone article, I have no idea but I\'ll happily take it.&nbsp;</p><p>That big panel across the top of the results seems only to appear if you search for specific entity by name. It works for bands, albums, movies, actors, games... As soon as you add any detail to the query, though, it vanishes. Has it always been there? I guess I hardly ever search for anything purely by name so I would very rarely see it.&nbsp;</p><p>I might have to&nbsp; pay it more attention, now I discover that one of my posts has been featured that way. I guess it proves you don\'t have to pay to get featured on Google search, at least.</p><p>And after all that, I guess my extremely late for Blaugust advice on how to get more page views and clicks would have to be write about very obscure things no-one else is covering or clothes and housing in online games. That\'s what seems to be working for me, anyway.</p><p>For a given value of "<i>working</i>", that is. A very, very tiny one.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/page-counts-clicks-x-cetra.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/page-counts-clicks-x-cetra.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUxG9Ma1NWHR_5gXbH5rvuUtjZorN_Klzi1nO7VTGqh1ib5YJ2ztC9a0Krz7yZRQU-ELugUy_nRzjJ_pV66j8jXXhVl3M5LtkT2BJ0eFw9ZouA1Mka7nsgzGz7IoSo_xdfReDThbu7tessxVMUVPUu4CojTbIqW_X1uEfUNlsqyyzVZQee4_kC4uv29xQ/s72-w640-h386-c/xcetragoogle1.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '8'}

I played<i> EverQuest II.</i></p><p>I don\'t mean I logged in, collected my completed <i>Overseer </i>missions, set my new ones for the day and logged out, like I do every day. Although, I <i>did </i>do all of that... except the logging out part.</p><p>I\'d been getting a slight itch to play an MMORPG "<i>properly</i>" again for a couple of days. It started, weirdly, when I was on <i>Steam </i>and noticed there were some patch notes for <i>Rift</i>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>It\'s a constant surprise to see dribbles of content still dripping into the game during&nbsp;<i>Gamigo</i>\'s maintenance-mode custodianship but guess perhaps the oddest thing is that I still have Rift installed. It\'s not like I\'m going to play it again.&nbsp;</p><p>Or is it?</p><p>It was when I found myself seriously considering doing just that, wondering whether I ought to pick up one of my old characters and carry on with them or if it mightn\'t be better to roll up a new one and start over, that I had a little talk with myself and decided I\'d be better off doing something productive in one of the games I was supposedly still playing istead, not taking a wholly ill-advised trip back in time to one I\'d abandoned years ago.</p><p>The choice was pretty obvious. I clearly ought to patch up <i>Wuthering Waves</i> and try to get back up to date there yet again. There\'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuht8zMs93E"><span style="color: #04ff00;">another update</span></a> coming and I haven\'t touched the last one yet. I\'m already behind and soon I\'ll be too far behind to catch up.</p><p>So, I didn\'t do that.</p><p>Second choice would probably be <i>Once Human</i>. There\'s a lot <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20250919/40780_1260194.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">going on</span></a> there, too, and I haven\'t seen any of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Didn\'t do that, either.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSjNTl6_OhInHyhU2I3hER5Ptr5VeDiVFaOUdji_jiZ9gPzw8JTz7MOtMWAYCkNJIKtcuC2vI-ljoh_1k9V29qhklJk1zojehj-bsSBe2xOIIIM2Px8vFZSm9EdM1_ZBCIAexG0RnsmpTXVItHQ6O5KdniS9FgmFjU45SEk7Zy72bRp-TylKShZfiG62s/s1920/eq2totf2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSjNTl6_OhInHyhU2I3hER5Ptr5VeDiVFaOUdji_jiZ9gPzw8JTz7MOtMWAYCkNJIKtcuC2vI-ljoh_1k9V29qhklJk1zojehj-bsSBe2xOIIIM2Px8vFZSm9EdM1_ZBCIAexG0RnsmpTXVItHQ6O5KdniS9FgmFjU45SEk7Zy72bRp-TylKShZfiG62s/w640-h360/eq2totf2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Also in the running, albeit as an outsider, there\'s <i>New World</i>. I realy like New World. It\'s my second most-played game on Steam, after <i>Valheim</i>. There\'s <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/season-10-nighthaven-announcement"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a major update</span></a> - you could almost call it an expansion - coming to the game in less than two weeks and it looks very interesting, all vampires and werewolves and spooky castles. Just right for the season</p><p>It\'s a free update but you have to have <i>New World Aeternum</i> to get it and I don\'t. So I\'d have to buy that, which would then give me even more new-to-me content. And contrary to what you might expect, that\'s actually a point against going back. I don\'t have the time or inclination to take on a big tranche of content in any game right now. I\'m looking for something to fill the odd session, here and there, not some big commitment that could take weeks.</p><p>Something like, oh, I don\'t know, a new solo dungeon or an instance I haven\'t done. Even better, one that might have some drops I could use. I\'ve always been a big advocate of the gameplay being its own reward but good drops are cake.</p><p>All of that led me back to <i>EQII</i>, where there have been two Game Updates this year that I haven\'t touched.&nbsp;</p><p>Alright, that\'s not entirely true. I did set foot in the new, contested dungeon that came in GU128 back in April. It didn\'t go well.</p><p>That update is called <i>Lure of Darkness</i> and features a large dungeon by the name of <i>Spiral of Vul</i>. It\'s designed for multiple groups to explore at the same time, old-school style, but it does have a small, soloable area at the front, as has been the norm in EQII as far back as beta.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/s1920/eq2totf3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/w640-h360/eq2totf3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I can say from experience that the allocated area for solo players <i>is </i>soloable. I did a little bit of it back in April and I didn\'t die. I also didn\'t have much fun. The mobs were very tough and took ages to kill. If there are any soloable bosses, I never got far enough to try my luck with them. I did one quest, whch took about half an hour and gave up.</p><p>That was on my Berserker. Since then, I\'ve upgraded all his gear using the Anniversary gift. He was mostly in 475-495 Resolve gear then and now he\'s wearing all 525. Resolve is a very sound indicator of performance, much like Gear Score in other games, and 30-50 points is enough to make a difference so I was hopeful I might get a little further this time.</p><p>I did not. I map-hopped over to the <i>Sodden Archipelago</i> and flew halfway across the zone to the entrance of the dungeon, went inside and immediately picked up a couple of shinies that completed a collection. That made the trip worthwhile, which was just as well because the trash mobs seemed no easier to kill than before. I tried a couple, decided it wasn\'t going to be any more fun than last time, so I&nbsp; left.</p><p>The second of the annual updates arrived in August. It\'s called<i> Fear of Eternity</i> and consists of Fabled versions of the dungeons from the 2012 expansion, <i>Chains of Eternity</i>. Fabled dungeons are generally the same as the originals but with all the mobs revamped for the current level cap and all the loot similarly upgraded. They also come in all the regular flavors - Solo, Heroic I and Heroic II.</p><p>My experience with Fabled dungeons at the time they first appear has been patchy. There have been some I\'ve been able to make progress in but mostly they\'re too tough for me. I usually give them a go, decide it\'s too much like hard work and leave them for later. Sometimes I do come back and finish them when I\'m a bit tougher, sometimes I forget they exist.</p><p>I was fully expecting the first one I tried, <i>Fabled Temple of the Faceless</i>, to be at least as hard as Spiral of Vul. I mean, you\'d think so, woudn\'t you? It\'s six months later, after all. What would be the point of adding something easier to the game at level cap?</p><p>It <i>was </i>easier. It was a lot easier. At least it was once I got myself sorted out.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/s639/eq2tofs2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/w400-h388/eq2tofs2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>The zone-in is much more conveniently placed, right on the dock where you zone in to Sodden Archipelago. No flying right across the map this time. That was nice. You can access all the available dungeons from the update from the same portal, too. Also nice.<p></p><p>I picked the first instance on the list, zoned in and pulled a mob to test the waters. They were warm. The mob, a three-up arrow spider, theoretically tough for trash, died in a reasonable time and didn\'t pose much of&nbsp; threat. I worked my across the opening area towards the first boss, killing as I went and it felt comfortable. It wasn\'t a walkover but it wasn\'t a grind. I felt like I was moving through the zone at a reasonable pace.</p><p>I got in range of the boss and thought about looking him up for strats but I couldn\'t be bothered so I just pulled him to see what would happen. Nothing much. In fact, as far as he was concerned, nothing at all. His health stayed solidly at 100% no matter how hard and how often I hit him. Clearly there were unseen factors in play.</p><p>With my merc pumping out the healing and the Berserker having a pretty solid self-healing capacity of his own it was a stalemate, albeit one that was eventually only going to end one way, even if it was likely to take an hour to get there. I rummaged in my bags for a <i>Totem of Escape</i> to port myself to the zone entrance and couldn\'t find one so I just legged it to the zone-line with the boss beating on me all the way. He still didn\'t make much of a dent, even with my back turned.</p><p>Once I was safe outside, I looked at the wiki. It turns out there are two pillars, one in each of two side-temples, that have to be destroyed before the first boss can be damaged. I vaguely remembered that from whenever I did the dungeon when I was questing through the relevant expansion but that was years ago and I needed to be reminded.</p><p>I went back in, found the pillars, knocked them down, then had a second go at the boss. It went much better that time.&nbsp;</p><p>I was curious to see what he\'d drop. I was hoping it would be gear over 500 Resolve. In fact it was identical in quality to the Anniversary freebies - 525 Resolve. Since I was already fully kitted out in that, I was also hoping it wouldn\'t be Plate Armor.

I played<i> EverQuest II.</i></p><p>I don\'t mean I logged in, collected my completed <i>Overseer </i>missions, set my new ones for the day and logged out, like I do every day. Although, I <i>did </i>do all of that... except the logging out part.</p><p>I\'d been getting a slight itch to play an MMORPG "<i>properly</i>" again for a couple of days. It started, weirdly, when I was on <i>Steam </i>and noticed there were some patch notes for <i>Rift</i>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>It\'s a constant surprise to see dribbles of content still dripping into the game during&nbsp;<i>Gamigo</i>\'s maintenance-mode custodianship but guess perhaps the oddest thing is that I still have Rift installed. It\'s not like I\'m going to play it again.&nbsp;</p><p>Or is it?</p><p>It was when I found myself seriously considering doing just that, wondering whether I ought to pick up one of my old characters and carry on with them or if it mightn\'t be better to roll up a new one and start over, that I had a little talk with myself and decided I\'d be better off doing something productive in one of the games I was supposedly still playing istead, not taking a wholly ill-advised trip back in time to one I\'d abandoned years ago.</p><p>The choice was pretty obvious. I clearly ought to patch up <i>Wuthering Waves</i> and try to get back up to date there yet again. There\'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuht8zMs93E"><span style="color: #04ff00;">another update</span></a> coming and I haven\'t touched the last one yet. I\'m already behind and soon I\'ll be too far behind to catch up.</p><p>So, I didn\'t do that.</p><p>Second choice would probably be <i>Once Human</i>. There\'s a lot <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20250919/40780_1260194.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">going on</span></a> there, too, and I haven\'t seen any of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Didn\'t do that, either.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSjNTl6_OhInHyhU2I3hER5Ptr5VeDiVFaOUdji_jiZ9gPzw8JTz7MOtMWAYCkNJIKtcuC2vI-ljoh_1k9V29qhklJk1zojehj-bsSBe2xOIIIM2Px8vFZSm9EdM1_ZBCIAexG0RnsmpTXVItHQ6O5KdniS9FgmFjU45SEk7Zy72bRp-TylKShZfiG62s/s1920/eq2totf2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSjNTl6_OhInHyhU2I3hER5Ptr5VeDiVFaOUdji_jiZ9gPzw8JTz7MOtMWAYCkNJIKtcuC2vI-ljoh_1k9V29qhklJk1zojehj-bsSBe2xOIIIM2Px8vFZSm9EdM1_ZBCIAexG0RnsmpTXVItHQ6O5KdniS9FgmFjU45SEk7Zy72bRp-TylKShZfiG62s/w640-h360/eq2totf2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Also in the running, albeit as an outsider, there\'s <i>New World</i>. I realy like New World. It\'s my second most-played game on Steam, after <i>Valheim</i>. There\'s <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/season-10-nighthaven-announcement"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a major update</span></a> - you could almost call it an expansion - coming to the game in less than two weeks and it looks very interesting, all vampires and werewolves and spooky castles. Just right for the season</p><p>It\'s a free update but you have to have <i>New World Aeternum</i> to get it and I don\'t. So I\'d have to buy that, which would then give me even more new-to-me content. And contrary to what you might expect, that\'s actually a point against going back. I don\'t have the time or inclination to take on a big tranche of content in any game right now. I\'m looking for something to fill the odd session, here and there, not some big commitment that could take weeks.</p><p>Something like, oh, I don\'t know, a new solo dungeon or an instance I haven\'t done. Even better, one that might have some drops I could use. I\'ve always been a big advocate of the gameplay being its own reward but good drops are cake.</p><p>All of that led me back to <i>EQII</i>, where there have been two Game Updates this year that I haven\'t touched.&nbsp;</p><p>Alright, that\'s not entirely true. I did set foot in the new, contested dungeon that came in GU128 back in April. It didn\'t go well.</p><p>That update is called <i>Lure of Darkness</i> and features a large dungeon by the name of <i>Spiral of Vul</i>. It\'s designed for multiple groups to explore at the same time, old-school style, but it does have a small, soloable area at the front, as has been the norm in EQII as far back as beta.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/s1920/eq2totf3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/w640-h360/eq2totf3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I can say from experience that the allocated area for solo players <i>is </i>soloable. I did a little bit of it back in April and I didn\'t die. I also didn\'t have much fun. The mobs were very tough and took ages to kill. If there are any soloable bosses, I never got far enough to try my luck with them. I did one quest, whch took about half an hour and gave up.</p><p>That was on my Berserker. Since then, I\'ve upgraded all his gear using the Anniversary gift. He was mostly in 475-495 Resolve gear then and now he\'s wearing all 525. Resolve is a very sound indicator of performance, much like Gear Score in other games, and 30-50 points is enough to make a difference so I was hopeful I might get a little further this time.</p><p>I did not. I map-hopped over to the <i>Sodden Archipelago</i> and flew halfway across the zone to the entrance of the dungeon, went inside and immediately picked up a couple of shinies that completed a collection. That made the trip worthwhile, which was just as well because the trash mobs seemed no easier to kill than before. I tried a couple, decided it wasn\'t going to be any more fun than last time, so I&nbsp; left.</p><p>The second of the annual updates arrived in August. It\'s called<i> Fear of Eternity</i> and consists of Fabled versions of the dungeons from the 2012 expansion, <i>Chains of Eternity</i>. Fabled dungeons are generally the same as the originals but with all the mobs revamped for the current level cap and all the loot similarly upgraded. They also come in all the regular flavors - Solo, Heroic I and Heroic II.</p><p>My experience with Fabled dungeons at the time they first appear has been patchy. There have been some I\'ve been able to make progress in but mostly they\'re too tough for me. I usually give them a go, decide it\'s too much like hard work and leave them for later. Sometimes I do come back and finish them when I\'m a bit tougher, sometimes I forget they exist.</p><p>I was fully expecting the first one I tried, <i>Fabled Temple of the Faceless</i>, to be at least as hard as Spiral of Vul. I mean, you\'d think so, woudn\'t you? It\'s six months later, after all. What would be the point of adding something easier to the game at level cap?</p><p>It <i>was </i>easier. It was a lot easier. At least it was once I got myself sorted out.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/s639/eq2tofs2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/w400-h388/eq2tofs2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>The zone-in is much more conveniently placed, right on the dock where you zone in to Sodden Archipelago. No flying right across the map this time. That was nice. You can access all the available dungeons from the update from the same portal, too. Also nice.<p></p><p>I picked the first instance on the list, zoned in and pulled a mob to test the waters. They were warm. The mob, a three-up arrow spider, theoretically tough for trash, died in a reasonable time and didn\'t pose much of&nbsp; threat. I worked my across the opening area towards the first boss, killing as I went and it felt comfortable. It wasn\'t a walkover but it wasn\'t a grind. I felt like I was moving through the zone at a reasonable pace.</p><p>I got in range of the boss and thought about looking him up for strats but I couldn\'t be bothered so I just pulled him to see what would happen. Nothing much. In fact, as far as he was concerned, nothing at all. His health stayed solidly at 100% no matter how hard and how often I hit him. Clearly there were unseen factors in play.</p><p>With my merc pumping out the healing and the Berserker having a pretty solid self-healing capacity of his own it was a stalemate, albeit one that was eventually only going to end one way, even if it was likely to take an hour to get there. I rummaged in my bags for a <i>Totem of Escape</i> to port myself to the zone entrance and couldn\'t find one so I just legged it to the zone-line with the boss beating on me all the way. He still didn\'t make much of a dent, even with my back turned.</p><p>Once I was safe outside, I looked at the wiki. It turns out there are two pillars, one in each of two side-temples, that have to be destroyed before the first boss can be damaged. I vaguely remembered that from whenever I did the dungeon when I was questing through the relevant expansion but that was years ago and I needed to be reminded.</p><p>I went back in, found the pillars, knocked them down, then had a second go at the boss. It went much better that time.&nbsp;</p><p>I was curious to see what he\'d drop. I was hoping it would be gear over 500 Resolve. In fact it was identical in quality to the Anniversary freebies - 525 Resolve. Since I was already fully kitted out in that, I was also hoping it wouldn\'t be Plate Armor. I could give that to my Inquisitor but she\'s not Level 130 yet so she\'d have to do five more levels before she could wear it.</p><p>I was hoping for cloth so my Necro could have it and cloth was what I got. On the first boss, anyway.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/s1249/eq2totf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/w640-h302/eq2totf1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>It had been fun and profitable so far so I carried on.

I finally ran out of things I\nwrote or recorded in the 70s, 80s and 90s that I could refashion or remake into\nnew songs using AI. It\'s taken me more than six months, hacking away at the past\na little more every day, but now it\'s clear cut and there\'s nothing left but\nstumps.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Well, okay, not exactly. I could give the longer pieces another pass or two.\n  See if there\'s anything I missed. I didn\'t really pry all that much away from\n  the longer of the two extended pieces of fiction because most of it seemed\n  unsuitable for conversion into song lyrics but maybe a different musical genre\n  would shake something else loose. Everything can\'t be sad dreampop.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And there might be the odd fragment I haven\'t found, left lurking somewhere in\n  the house. I can think of a couple of pieces I remember writing that haven\'t\n  turned up yet. One of them would be perfect. But if they still exist, I\'ve run\n  out of ideas on where to look. They weren\'t in the loft and that was my last\n  hope.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or maybe not. There are a couple of outside possibilities. I doubt very much\n  that I\'m likely to find any of the printed zines but I have a couple of PC\n  floppy disks I haven\'t been able to read.

Which I still have. And the disks. The problem there is that I\'d need\na CRT monitor to plug the Amiga into and I got rid of the last of those just\nafter the pandemic, when I was having a clear-out. One more piece of evidence to\nsupport my belief that decluttering is never a good idea.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was looking into it and it seems you can get various adapters to connect an\n  Amiga to an HDMI display but my experience with such things in the past has\n  not always been great and honestly I don\'t think I can be bothered. If I\'m\n  honest, I don\'t even want to dig the Amiga out from the inaccessible\n  hidey-hole I buried it in when I was almost sure I\'d never want to use it\n  again...\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, I think I\'m just going to have to accept that those last, few fragments\n  are gone for good. And that\'s okay.

I finally ran out of things I\nwrote or recorded in the 70s, 80s and 90s that I could refashion or remake into\nnew songs using AI. It\'s taken me more than six months, hacking away at the past\na little more every day, but now it\'s clear cut and there\'s nothing left but\nstumps.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Well, okay, not exactly. I could give the longer pieces another pass or two.\n  See if there\'s anything I missed. I didn\'t really pry all that much away from\n  the longer of the two extended pieces of fiction because most of it seemed\n  unsuitable for conversion into song lyrics but maybe a different musical genre\n  would shake something else loose. Everything can\'t be sad dreampop.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And there might be the odd fragment I haven\'t found, left lurking somewhere in\n  the house. I can think of a couple of pieces I remember writing that haven\'t\n  turned up yet. One of them would be perfect. But if they still exist, I\'ve run\n  out of ideas on where to look. They weren\'t in the loft and that was my last\n  hope.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or maybe not. There are a couple of outside possibilities. I doubt very much\n  that I\'m likely to find any of the printed zines but I have a couple of PC\n  floppy disks I haven\'t been able to read.

Which I still have. And the disks. The problem there is that I\'d need\na CRT monitor to plug the Amiga into and I got rid of the last of those just\nafter the pandemic, when I was having a clear-out. One more piece of evidence to\nsupport my belief that decluttering is never a good idea.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was looking into it and it seems you can get various adapters to connect an\n  Amiga to an HDMI display but my experience with such things in the past has\n  not always been great and honestly I don\'t think I can be bothered. If I\'m\n  honest, I don\'t even want to dig the Amiga out from the inaccessible\n  hidey-hole I buried it in when I was almost sure I\'d never want to use it\n  again...\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, I think I\'m just going to have to accept that those last, few fragments\n  are gone for good.

I was up to about a couple of\nhours a day, mostly last thing every night, but now I spend that time on my\nlaptop, burning through Credits on <i>Suno </i>and stitching fragments together\ninto songs in <i>Audacity</i>.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'m still paying several subscriptions to streaming services all the same,\n  though, so I feel obligated to make at least some use of all of them. We did\n  pause&nbsp;<i>Netflix </i>for three months but I re-started it for\n  <i>Wednesday </i>(And happily caught the finale of <i>Upload </i>around the\n  same time.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  While I was looking through the schedules for more to watch, so as to get my\n  money\'s-worth, I noticed the missing seasons of couple of shows I had been\n  following a few months ago had miraculously appeared.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  One of them was <i>Roswell: New Mexico,</i> for which Netflix very annoyingly\n  had held the license to Seasons 1 and 2 in the UK but not Seasons 3 and 4,\n  which&nbsp;were exclusive to <i>Sky </i>over here&nbsp;a the time (If I\n  remember right...). That was great but also too late because, when I finished\n  the first two seasons, I didn\'t want to pay yet another sub so I used a VPN to\n  watch them on Netflix USA.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even more annoying was <i>Young Sheldon</i>, for which Netflix had the rights\n  to stream six out of seven seasons in both the UK and the US but no rights to\n  the final season for either. That was on some US station or service I forget\n  now. All I do remember about it was that I couldn\'t watch it, even with a VPN.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, that agreement, whatever it was, must be over now because Netflix has\n  the full run available to stream. I was finally able to catch up with the\n  show. I\'ll tell you what I thought of it later.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Our other streaming service is <i>Amazon Prime </i>but that one pays for\n  itself in shipping alone, particularly since Mrs. Bhagpuss buys at least one\n  thing on <i>Amazon </i>pretty much every day. What with that and the games and\n  music offers included in the bundle, I feel no urge to watch anything on Prime\n  at all if I don\'t feel like it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The problem there is that I also have <i>Apple+</i> through Prime as an\n  add-on. It was very cheap for three months and I didn\'t really care if I was\n  watching anything on Apple+ or not but now it\'s back up to full price it seems\n  like I should at least watch <i>something</i>. Mrs Bhagpuss doesn\'t currently\n  watch anything on the channel at all so it\'s up to me to pick up the\n  slack.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Luckily, there\'s no shortage of good stuff to choose from. I thought about\n  starting several series about which I\'d heard good things -\n  <i>Severance, Slow Horses, Foundation, The Studio</i> - but in the end I\n  decided on <i>Ted Lasso</i>. Main reason: the episodes were shorter. Secondary\n  reason: I like sitcoms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have now watched all of Young Sheldon Season 7 and Ted Lasso Season 1. The\n  end of one story, the start of another. Here\'s what I thought about them both.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Young Sheldon</i> - Season 7</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was quite dubious about the whole concept of Young Sheldon to begin with.\n  I\'ve never been a huge fan of prequels (Is anyone?) and prequels built around\n  main characters as children can come across as a bit desperate. Added to that,\n  this is just one character from an ensemble show, one that relies almost\n  entirely on the particular skills of the specific actor who played him,\n  <i>and </i>it\'s a character often considered to be difficult and\n  controversial.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The prospects didn\'t look good but contrary to expectations it turned out to\n  be a warm, comfortable, enjoyable watch. A lot less spiky and brittle than the\n  show that spawned it, in fact.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, it also had one other, major problem, something common to all\n  long-running shows that revolve around a young child. Children grow up.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In one respect, that worked in Young Sheldon\'s favor. Old Sheldon, if we can\n  call him that, is a divisive figure in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. A lot of\n  people have some very valid objections to the character in terms of the way it\n  can appear to promote and perpetuate some stereotypically negative views of\n  neuro-diversity. I personally feel the full character arc, taken across the\n  entire run of the show, counters many of those objections, producing a nuanced\n  and distinctly positive image of someone struggling with numerous challenges\n  they find it hard to overcome.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if that\'s true, though, you\'d need to have watched the entire 279\n  episodes to appreciate it. And no-one who thinks Sheldon is an offensive\n  caricature is going to sit through 93 hours of a show that makes their skin\n  crawl just to see if maybe it wasn\'t quite as bad as they thought it was after\n  all. As the saying goes, that\'s an awful lot of Shawshank before you get to\n  the Redemption.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I didn\'t think Young Sheldon had the same level of difficulty. In <i>TBBT</i>,\n  there are five central characters and it\'s not hard to make an argument that\n  all of them are potentially offensive in the way they\'re written and\n  performed. Young Sheldon just has... young Sheldon. And he\'s kinda cute.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All those mannerisms and affectations that seem so mannered and performative\n  in an adult seem a lot softer and more relatable in a child. Kids, after all,\n  <i>do </i>say and do<i>&nbsp;</i>the darnedest things, don\'t they? And it is\n  undeniably satisfying, if you\'ve watched a lot of TBBT, to see many of\n  Sheldon\'s tropes and foibles from that show get their start in some specific\n  event in this one, usually for an understandable and sympathetic reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that is in the show as a whole, though. What about the final\n  season?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, the most striking thing about it is that Sheldon isn\'t actually in it\n  all that much. He\'s in every episode but he\'s rarely the central character and\n  the main story arcs seldom revolve around him. He\'s almost a peripheral\n  character at times, chipping in with a few side-stories or popping up to add\n  some extra perspective to someone else\'s story.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, it\'s about his family, all of whom get some significant character\n  development that changes or enhances what we knew about them. For example...\n</p>\n<p>(This bit might get a bit spoilery from here on down...)</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Meemaw </i>really starts to show her age as she loses her home, her\n  business and her freedom all in quick succession. Her veneer of invincibility\n  begins to peel away and her indomitable spirit wilts a little.\n  <i>Missy </i>shows a good deal of unexpected maturity and character growth as\n  does <i>Georgie</i>, albeit each in very different ways. Sheldon\'s mother\'s\n  religious beliefs start to move her closer to the mania seen in the adult\n  show, while his father... dies.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That was a shock, even though if I\'d been counting the passage of time I\nought to have expected it. It happens right towards the end of the run, just\nwhen everything seems to be going pretty well for him and the family.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was not best pleased when it happened, not only because I liked the\n  character as played by <i>Lance Barber</i> but because I had Young Sheldon\n  firmly in my "<i>Send me off to sleep in a good mood</i>." slot and it seemed\n  like it was going to finish with a couple of episodes where all the cast would\n  be in mourning and filled with grief. Not what I want, right before I nod off.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the end, though, the whole thing was handled very gently, not side-stepping\n  the emotions but not losing the warmth and humor either. It was a particularly\n  telling way to show some of Sheldon\'s emotional growth or lack of it, too,\n  something I also thought was well-handled.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As a run, I\'d call Young Sheldon a success. It lasted seven seasons, which is\n  more than decent for a sitcom. It kept the whole cast together and it was\n  consistently written and well-played throughout by an excellent ensemble cast.\n  It was great to see Annie Potts and <i>Ed Begley Jr</i>. in meaty roles again,\n  too.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The underlying problem of child actors turning into adult actors was kept to a\n  minimum by the unusual expedient of partially writing the lead character out\n  of his own show. Missy and Georgie both seemed to age at a rate that allowed\n  the audience barely to notice it happening but by Season 7,<i>\n    Iain Armitage</i>, playing Sheldon, looked very odd indeed, like a much older child playing a\n  much younger one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The same mannerisms that had made him a cute-if-quirky kid turned him into a\n  slightly disturbing adolescent, never changing his expression, keeping his\n  hands stiffly by his sides and always wearing awkwardly formal clothes. That\n  looks funny in an eight-year old but uncomfortable and unsettling in a\n  teenager. It\'s not surprising they mostly wrote around him towards the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The ensemble cast was uniformly excellent. I liked everyone, which is ideal\n  for a sitcom. I especially enjoyed <i>Annie Potts </i>as Meemaw and her double\n  act with <i>Craig T Nelson</i> as her lover, <i>Dale</i>, was always a joy.\n  The entire cast - and it\'s a big one counting all the regular supporting parts\n  - was on top form throughout and possibly the highest praise I can offer is\n  that, by the end of the final season, I think I liked every one of the\n  characters more than I had at the start.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Actually, the highest praise I can offer is that I\'d happily watch the whole\n  run again. Which I almost certainly will.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Ted Lasso</i> - Season 1&nbsp;</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d heard a little about this show. I\'d heard it was heart-warming, upbeat and\n  positive. I\'d heard it was <i>nice</i>. I also knew it was about a sports\n  coach and, of course, that it was an American sitcom.&nbsp;When I was looking\n  for something to replace Young Sheldon, it seemed like another sweet slice of\n  Americana to send me off to sleep smiling.\n</p>\n<p>Yeah. About that...</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s not "<i>nice</i>", is it?&nbsp; It\'s not all that sweet either. It\'s\n  acerbic and sharp and occasionally even a little bitter. Ted Lasso (The\n  character no the show.) is irony personified.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For one thing, he may be American and a sports coach but he\'s not in America\n  and he\'s not coaching an American sport. Somehow, in all the things I\'d read,\n  I hadn\'t picked up on the "<i>Sit</i>" in the sitcom, which is that he\'s in\n  London, coaching at a Premier League football club.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Or, rather, managing one, which I\'m not sure they ever actually say. Everyone\n  keeps calling him "<i>Coach</i>" but he\'s doing the job we usually call\n  "<i>Manager</i>" over here and he has an actual coach standing next to him,\n  who everyone also calls "<i>Coach</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The show is full of oddnesses like that. I\'d say it does 98% of a great job of\n  being as convincing about life in modern Britain as 98% of British sitcoms can\n  manage but the 2% differences are wholly different in each case.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The writing doesn\'t actually lean that heavily into the\n  one-language-two-cultures comedy you\'d expect. There\'s plenty of that around\n  the margins but it\'s never the point of the show. Ironically, that makes the\n  moments when cultural infelicities do pop up all the more obvious.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, there\'s some considerable business in several episodes about\n  American sport not accepting a tie as a valid result. Which is fine. Except\n  that we don\'t really use the expression "tie" all that much over here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ted <i>always </i>uses the word "<i>tie</i>" in Season 1. Every British or\n  British-localized speaker he uses it to uses it back to him, frequently when\n  no-one here would ever use the word&nbsp;in that way. We\'d almost always say\n  "<i>draw</i>", which is what we call a sports match where the scores end up\n  tied.&nbsp; We use tie as a verb routinely but rarely as a noun.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, just to make it even more confusing, a "<i>tie</i>" as a noun in a\n  sporting comment usually means a fixture or a match. As in "<i>a cup tie</i>".\n  But then, a draw can be a fixture, too, as in "<i>We got Chelsea in the next round - that\'s a tough draw.</i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I can see how it could be confusing but I\'m not even that into sports and it\'s\n  all just second-nature to me because I grew up here. When the word-choices\n  don\'t ring true, it\'s distracting. And clearly I\'m not the only one who\n  noticed because, in the first episode of Season 2, when ties/draws become a\n  big plot point, both words are used and a context for the different usage is\n  established. It\'s just a shame they didn\'t think of that in Season 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of which might seem like nit-picking but it\'s a real nit-picking kind of\n  show. It\'s full of little bits of business about cultural differences and\n  expectations and about how sports teams operate, all of which revolve around\n  nuances of language and fine details of procedure or practice.\n</p>\n<p>I found all that quite engaging. And enlightening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  For example, a while back, <i>Wilhelm </i>posted something on\n  <i>TAGN </i>about bottled water and I left a comment in which I referred to\n  drinking carbonated bottled water, to which Wilhelm pointed out that Americans\n  generally wouldn\'t see much point in drinking fizzy water - they\'d just drink\n  soda if they wanted fizz.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did not know that. Despite having steeped myself in Americana, second-hand,\n  through comics, books, TV, music and movies since I was a child, I had never\n  come across the idea that sparkling water was un-American. And now here it is\n  as a running gag in Ted Lasso, where he keeps being given glasses of water to\n  drink and he takes a huge swig, expecting it to be plain, then spits it all\n  over himself or someone else because it turns out to be sparkling. Who\n  knew?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s plenty like that but the strength of the show isn\'t so much in the\n  jokes as the characters. Or perhaps I should say the caricatures, which is\n  what they seem like, at least in the first few episodes. It takes a good while\n  before the nuances and subtleties begin to reveal themselves or, I ought to\n  say, are revealed by the writers.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And by the end of the season, I still wasn\'t sure just how much depth lay\n  beneath most of the surfaces. The hints at anything more are so brief, so\n  fleeting, it sometimes felt as though I was imagining them. <i>Keeley </i>is a\n  bit older and smarter than she seems, <i>Coach Beard</i> has some quite\n  peculiar-sounding sexual history, <i>Jamie Tartt</i> has an overbearing dad...\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even as I try to tally those glimpses of character, though, I realize how\n  little is really there. Everything is suggestion, misdirection,\n  sleight-of-hand. After ten episodes, how much do we really know about anyone?\n  Not much more than you could write on an index card.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except, maybe, for Ted. <i>He </i>has some depths and they are, largely,\n  hidden. Not from the audience, who get to see him alone in his apartment at\n  night, but from everyone around him.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To everyone else, he\'s relentlessly upbeat but it doesn\'t seem to have gotten\n  him all that far. He coached one successful season of what I think must have\n  been college football and then got head-hunted by a vengeful divorcee in the\n  expectation his skills would not be transferable and he would be a disaster as\n  the "<i>coach</i>" of a top-flight club in the English Premier League, whose\n  prospects she hoped to damage so as to upset her (Unbearable.) ex.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Meanwhile, that very same relentlessly upbeat tendency is revealed as the\n  proximate cause of Ted\'s own impending divorce. He\'s so fucking nice his wife\n  can\'t stand to be around him any more.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Surprised by that swear-word I just threw in,&nbsp;seemingly so unnecessarily?\n  That\'s the show. It does that All. The. Time. It\'s another thing I wasn\'t\n  expecting. When someone tells you a sitcom is really nice and the main\n  character is really nice and "<i>nice</i>" is the word you hear associated\n  with it more than any other, you\'re probably expecting something along the\n  lines of a live-action <i>Wallace and Grommit. </i>Not a&nbsp;swear-fest.\n  Which is what you get.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a really sweary show. Everyone says "<i>fuck</i>" all the time. Except\n  Ted. Who also says it but only when it matters. Unlike&nbsp;over-the-hill\n  superstar <i>Roy Kent</i>, who has a series of running gags revolving around\n  the F-word, which he uses at every opportunity and in front of anyone\n  including, repeatedly and hilariously, his niece and a bunch of her eight-year\n  old pals. The funniest thing about it is his complete unawareness that it\'s\n  not entirely acceptable behavior. He ends up dropping a bunch of F-bombs in\n  his first post-footballing career gig as a TV pundit, which predictably\n  endears him to the audience, if not the presenters. (Although that\'s at the\n  start of Season 2 so I shouldn\'t mention it here...)\n</p>\n<p>\n  I do like me some good, creative swearing, so it\'s a plus point as far as I\'m\n  concerned. And Roy\'s probably my favorite character, unless that\'s Keeley.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a good show, sweary or not. I\'m not quite convinced it\'s a\n  <i>great </i>show, the way it seems to have been pitched in some of the things\n  I\'ve read about it, but it\'s funny and the characters are likeable and it has\n  that hard-to-resist sports narrative running in the background all the time,\n  where even though it\'s all made up, you still want to know whether the team is\n  going to win or not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just let\'s not talk about the actual footballing scenes. Has any show ever got\n  those right? I doubt it. Some of them here have been quite painful to watch,\n  and as I say I\'m not even a sports fan.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I am a sitcom fan, though, and this is a good one. I\'m on Season 2 now and I\n  notice, looking ahead, that the episodes are longer throughout.

We did\n  pause&nbsp;<i>Netflix </i>for three months but I re-started it for\n  <i>Wednesday </i>(And happily caught the finale of <i>Upload </i>around the\n  same time.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  While I was looking through the schedules for more to watch, so as to get my\n  money\'s-worth, I noticed the missing seasons of couple of shows I had been\n  following a few months ago had miraculously appeared.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  One of them was <i>Roswell: New Mexico,</i> for which Netflix very annoyingly\n  had held the license to Seasons 1 and 2 in the UK but not Seasons 3 and 4,\n  which&nbsp;were exclusive to <i>Sky </i>over here&nbsp;a the time (If I\n  remember right...). That was great but also too late because, when I finished\n  the first two seasons, I didn\'t want to pay yet another sub so I used a VPN to\n  watch them on Netflix USA.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even more annoying was <i>Young Sheldon</i>, for which Netflix had the rights\n  to stream six out of seven seasons in both the UK and the US but no rights to\n  the final season for either. That was on some US station or service I forget\n  now. All I do remember about it was that I couldn\'t watch it, even with a VPN.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, that agreement, whatever it was, must be over now because Netflix has\n  the full run available to stream. I was finally able to catch up with the\n  show. I\'ll tell you what I thought of it later.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Our other streaming service is <i>Amazon Prime </i>but that one pays for\n  itself in shipping alone, particularly since Mrs. Bhagpuss buys at least one\n  thing on <i>Amazon </i>pretty much every day. What with that and the games and\n  music offers included in the bundle, I feel no urge to watch anything on Prime\n  at all if I don\'t feel like it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The problem there is that I also have <i>Apple+</i> through Prime as an\n  add-on. It was very cheap for three months and I didn\'t really care if I was\n  watching anything on Apple+ or not but now it\'s back up to full price it seems\n  like I should at least watch <i>something</i>. Mrs Bhagpuss doesn\'t currently\n  watch anything on the channel at all so it\'s up to me to pick up the\n  slack.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Luckily, there\'s no shortage of good stuff to choose from. I thought about\n  starting several series about which I\'d heard good things -\n  <i>Severance, Slow Horses, Foundation, The Studio</i> - but in the end I\n  decided on <i>Ted Lasso</i>. Main reason: the episodes were shorter. Secondary\n  reason: I like sitcoms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have now watched all of Young Sheldon Season 7 and Ted Lasso Season 1. The\n  end of one story, the start of another. Here\'s what I thought about them both.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Young Sheldon</i> - Season 7</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was quite dubious about the whole concept of Young Sheldon to begin with.\n  I\'ve never been a huge fan of prequels (Is anyone?) and prequels built around\n  main characters as children can come across as a bit desperate. Added to that,\n  this is just one character from an ensemble show, one that relies almost\n  entirely on the particular skills of the specific actor who played him,\n  <i>and </i>it\'s a character often considered to be difficult and\n  controversial.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The prospects didn\'t look good but contrary to expectations it turned out to\n  be a warm, comfortable, enjoyable watch. A lot less spiky and brittle than the\n  show that spawned it, in fact.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, it also had one other, major problem, something common to all\n  long-running shows that revolve around a young child. Children grow up.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In one respect, that worked in Young Sheldon\'s favor. Old Sheldon, if we can\n  call him that, is a divisive figure in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. A lot of\n  people have some very valid objections to the character in terms of the way it\n  can appear to promote and perpetuate some stereotypically negative views of\n  neuro-diversity. I personally feel the full character arc, taken across the\n  entire run of the show, counters many of those objections, producing a nuanced\n  and distinctly positive image of someone struggling with numerous challenges\n  they find it hard to overcome.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if that\'s true, though, you\'d need to have watched the entire 279\n  episodes to appreciate it. And no-one who thinks Sheldon is an offensive\n  caricature is going to sit through 93 hours of a show that makes their skin\n  crawl just to see if maybe it wasn\'t quite as bad as they thought it was after\n  all. As the saying goes, that\'s an awful lot of Shawshank before you get to\n  the Redemption.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I didn\'t think Young Sheldon had the same level of difficulty. In <i>TBBT</i>,\n  there are five central characters and it\'s not hard to make an argument that\n  all of them are potentially offensive in the way they\'re written and\n  performed. Young Sheldon just has... young Sheldon. And he\'s kinda cute.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All those mannerisms and affectations that seem so mannered and performative\n  in an adult seem a lot softer and more relatable in a child. Kids, after all,\n  <i>do </i>say and do<i>&nbsp;</i>the darnedest things, don\'t they? And it is\n  undeniably satisfying, if you\'ve watched a lot of TBBT, to see many of\n  Sheldon\'s tropes and foibles from that show get their start in some specific\n  event in this one, usually for an understandable and sympathetic reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that is in the show as a whole, though. What about the final\n  season?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, the most striking thing about it is that Sheldon isn\'t actually in it\n  all that much. He\'s in every episode but he\'s rarely the central character and\n  the main story arcs seldom revolve around him. He\'s almost a peripheral\n  character at times, chipping in with a few side-stories or popping up to add\n  some extra perspective to someone else\'s story.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, it\'s about his family, all of whom get some significant character\n  development that changes or enhances what we knew about them. For example...\n</p>\n<p>(This bit might get a bit spoilery from here on down...)</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Meemaw </i>really starts to show her age as she loses her home, her\n  business and her freedom all in quick succession. Her veneer of invincibility\n  begins to peel away and her indomitable spirit wilts a little.\n  <i>Missy </i>shows a good deal of unexpected maturity and character growth as\n  does <i>Georgie</i>, albeit each in very different ways. Sheldon\'s mother\'s\n  religious beliefs start to move her closer to the mania seen in the adult\n  show, while his father... dies.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That was a shock, even though if I\'d been counting the passage of time I\nought to have expected it. It happens right towards the end of the run, just\nwhen everything seems to be going pretty well for him and the family.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was not best pleased when it happened, not only because I liked the\n  character as played by <i>Lance Barber</i> but because I had Young Sheldon\n  firmly in my "<i>Send me off to sleep in a good mood</i>." slot and it seemed\n  like it was going to finish with a couple of episodes where all the cast would\n  be in mourning and filled with grief. Not what I want, right before I nod off.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the end, though, the whole thing was handled very gently, not side-stepping\n  the emotions but not losing the warmth and humor either. It was a particularly\n  telling way to show some of Sheldon\'s emotional growth or lack of it, too,\n  something I also thought was well-handled.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As a run, I\'d call Young Sheldon a success. It lasted seven seasons, which is\n  more than decent for a sitcom. It kept the whole cast together and it was\n  consistently written and well-played throughout by an excellent ensemble cast.\n  It was great to see Annie Potts and <i>Ed Begley Jr</i>. in meaty roles again,\n  too.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The underlying problem of child actors turning into adult actors was kept to a\n  minimum by the unusual expedient of partially writing the lead character out\n  of his own show. Missy and Georgie both seemed to age at a rate that allowed\n  the audience barely to notice it happening but by Season 7,<i>\n    Iain Armitage</i>, playing Sheldon, looked very odd indeed, like a much older child playing a\n  much younger one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The same mannerisms that had made him a cute-if-quirky kid turned him into a\n  slightly disturbing adolescent, never changing his expression, keeping his\n  hands stiffly by his sides and always wearing awkwardly formal clothes. That\n  looks funny in an eight-year old but uncomfortable and unsettling in a\n  teenager. It\'s not surprising they mostly wrote around him towards the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The ensemble cast was uniformly excellent. I liked everyone, which is ideal\n  for a sitcom. I especially enjoyed <i>Annie Potts </i>as Meemaw and her double\n  act with <i>Craig T Nelson</i> as her lover, <i>Dale</i>, was always a joy.\n  The entire cast - and it\'s a big one counting all the regular supporting parts\n  - was on top form throughout and possibly the highest praise I can offer is\n  that, by the end of the final season, I think I liked every one of the\n  characters more than I had at the start.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Actually, the highest praise I can offer is that I\'d happily watch the whole\n  run again. Which I almost certainly will.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Ted Lasso</i> - Season 1&nbsp;</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d heard a little about this show. I\'d heard it was heart-warming, upbeat and\n  positive. I\'d heard it was <i>nice</i>. I also knew it was about a sports\n  coach and, of course, that it was an American sitcom.&nbsp;When I was looking\n  for something to replace Young Sheldon, it seemed like another sweet slice of\n  Americana to send me off to sleep smiling.\n</p>\n<p>Yeah. About that...</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s not "<i>nice</i>", is it?&nbsp; It\'s not all that sweet either. It\'s\n  acerbic and sharp and occasionally even a little bitter. Ted Lasso (The\n  character no the show.) is irony personified.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For one thing, he may be American and a sports coach but he\'s not in America\n  and he\'s not coaching an American sport. Somehow, in all the things I\'d read,\n  I hadn\'t picked up on the "<i>Sit</i>" in the sitcom, which is that he\'s in\n  London, coaching at a Premier League football club.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Or, rather, managing one, which I\'m not sure they ever actually say. Everyone\n  keeps calling him "<i>Coach</i>" but he\'s doing the job we usually call\n  "<i>Manager</i>" over here and he has an actual coach standing next to him,\n  who everyone also calls "<i>Coach</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The show is full of oddnesses like that. I\'d say it does 98% of a great job of\n  being as convincing about life in modern Britain as 98% of British sitcoms can\n  manage but the 2% differences are wholly different in each case.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The writing doesn\'t actually lean that heavily into the\n  one-language-two-cultures comedy you\'d expect. There\'s plenty of that around\n  the margins but it\'s never the point of the show. Ironically, that makes the\n  moments when cultural infelicities do pop up all the more obvious.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, there\'s some considerable business in several episodes about\n  American sport not accepting a tie as a valid result. Which is fine. Except\n  that we don\'t really use the expression "tie" all that much over here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ted <i>always </i>uses the word "<i>tie</i>" in Season 1. Every British or\n  British-localized speaker he uses it to uses it back to him, frequently when\n  no-one here would ever use the word&nbsp;in that way. We\'d almost always say\n  "<i>draw</i>", which is what we call a sports match where the scores end up\n  tied.&nbsp; We use tie as a verb routinely but rarely as a noun.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, just to make it even more confusing, a "<i>tie</i>" as a noun in a\n  sporting comment usually means a fixture or a match. As in "<i>a cup tie</i>".\n  But then, a draw can be a fixture, too, as in "<i>We got Chelsea in the next round - that\'s a tough draw.</i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I can see how it could be confusing but I\'m not even that into sports and it\'s\n  all just second-nature to me because I grew up here. When the word-choices\n  don\'t ring true, it\'s distracting. And clearly I\'m not the only one who\n  noticed because, in the first episode of Season 2, when ties/draws become a\n  big plot point, both words are used and a context for the different usage is\n  established. It\'s just a shame they didn\'t think of that in Season 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of which might seem like nit-picking but it\'s a real nit-picking kind of\n  show. It\'s full of little bits of business about cultural differences and\n  expectations and about how sports teams operate, all of which revolve around\n  nuances of language and fine details of procedure or practice.\n</p>\n<p>I found all that quite engaging. And enlightening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  For example, a while back, <i>Wilhelm </i>posted something on\n  <i>TAGN </i>about bottled water and I left a comment in which I referred to\n  drinking carbonated bottled water, to which Wilhelm pointed out that Americans\n  generally wouldn\'t see much point in drinking fizzy water - they\'d just drink\n  soda if they wanted fizz.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did not know that. Despite having steeped myself in Americana, second-hand,\n  through comics, books, TV, music and movies since I was a child, I had never\n  come across the idea that sparkling water was un-American. And now here it is\n  as a running gag in Ted Lasso, where he keeps being given glasses of water to\n  drink and he takes a huge swig, expecting it to be plain, then spits it all\n  over himself or someone else because it turns out to be sparkling. Who\n  knew?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s plenty like that but the strength of the show isn\'t so much in the\n  jokes as the characters. Or perhaps I should say the caricatures, which is\n  what they seem like, at least in the first few episodes. It takes a good while\n  before the nuances and subtleties begin to reveal themselves or, I ought to\n  say, are revealed by the writers.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And by the end of the season, I still wasn\'t sure just how much depth lay\n  beneath most of the surfaces. The hints at anything more are so brief, so\n  fleeting, it sometimes felt as though I was imagining them. <i>Keeley </i>is a\n  bit older and smarter than she seems, <i>Coach Beard</i> has some quite\n  peculiar-sounding sexual history, <i>Jamie Tartt</i> has an overbearing dad...\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even as I try to tally those glimpses of character, though, I realize how\n  little is really there. Everything is suggestion, misdirection,\n  sleight-of-hand. After ten episodes, how much do we really know about anyone?\n  Not much more than you could write on an index card.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except, maybe, for Ted. <i>He </i>has some depths and they are, largely,\n  hidden. Not from the audience, who get to see him alone in his apartment at\n  night, but from everyone around him.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To everyone else, he\'s relentlessly upbeat but it doesn\'t seem to have gotten\n  him all that far. He coached one successful season of what I think must have\n  been college football and then got head-hunted by a vengeful divorcee in the\n  expectation his skills would not be transferable and he would be a disaster as\n  the "<i>coach</i>" of a top-flight club in the English Premier League, whose\n  prospects she hoped to damage so as to upset her (Unbearable.) ex.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Meanwhile, that very same relentlessly upbeat tendency is revealed as the\n  proximate cause of Ted\'s own impending divorce. He\'s so fucking nice his wife\n  can\'t stand to be around him any more.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Surprised by that swear-word I just threw in,&nbsp;seemingly so unnecessarily?\n  That\'s the show. It does that All. The. Time. It\'s another thing I wasn\'t\n  expecting. When someone tells you a sitcom is really nice and the main\n  character is really nice and "<i>nice</i>" is the word you hear associated\n  with it more than any other, you\'re probably expecting something along the\n  lines of a live-action <i>Wallace and Grommit. </i>Not a&nbsp;swear-fest.\n  Which is what you get.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a really sweary show. Everyone says "<i>fuck</i>" all the time. Except\n  Ted. Who also says it but only when it matters. Unlike&nbsp;over-the-hill\n  superstar <i>Roy Kent</i>, who has a series of running gags revolving around\n  the F-word, which he uses at every opportunity and in front of anyone\n  including, repeatedly and hilariously, his niece and a bunch of her eight-year\n  old pals. The funniest thing about it is his complete unawareness that it\'s\n  not entirely acceptable behavior. He ends up dropping a bunch of F-bombs in\n  his first post-footballing career gig as a TV pundit, which predictably\n  endears him to the audience, if not the presenters. (Although that\'s at the\n  start of Season 2 so I shouldn\'t mention it here...)\n</p>\n<p>\n  I do like me some good, creative swearing, so it\'s a plus point as far as I\'m\n  concerned. And Roy\'s probably my favorite character, unless that\'s Keeley.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a good show, sweary or not. I\'m not quite convinced it\'s a\n  <i>great </i>show, the way it seems to have been pitched in some of the things\n  I\'ve read about it, but it\'s funny and the characters are likeable and it has\n  that hard-to-resist sports narrative running in the background all the time,\n  where even though it\'s all made up, you still want to know whether the team is\n  going to win or not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just let\'s not talk about the actual footballing scenes. Has any show ever got\n  those right? I doubt it. Some of them here have been quite painful to watch,\n  and as I say I\'m not even a sports fan.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I am a sitcom fan, though, and this is a good one. I\'m on Season 2 now and I\n  notice, looking ahead, that the episodes are longer throughout. I\'m guessing\n  that means more plot and deeper characterization rather than more jokes but\n  I\'ll be happy, either way.\n</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/beginnings-and-endings.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/beginnings-and-endings.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKqBRN0umxps8SeA9OiEEcvgVRybKVRUahkxtHEfGt7iHDjMn_3zYVQ6wm3yRe3QDq4eeAowjxS2lIBI13qdE2jSDsaHiQFVFNBckcXV9tfcTZRMELR40ch6dFjmqB1t2CQ9LBlwp6QIUALBhEvQ2fuysMlhQrZg8P6Z7n-SZp6lC7BxAq5GAXEP5Gg_U/s72-w640-h394-c/tls11.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

In Once Human it\'s <i>Deviants</i>. Pals roam around your\n  home. Deviants roam around your home. Pals come with you and fight stuff.\n  Deviants come with you and fight stuff.

Luckily for <i>Starry</i>, the studio behind Once Human, they didn\'t make it so you have you catch Deviants by throwing small spheres at them from a distance. No, you\n<i>  walk </i>up to the Deviant, which is <i>already </i>inside a sphere, and you catch\n  it by holding up your hand, which is <i>entirely </i>different.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not clear on whether the&nbsp; event is a one-way deal, with Pals\n  appearing in Once Human but not the other way around, or whether Deviants will also be popping up in\n  Palworld. Even if it\'s the latter, I doubt very much it would be enough to induce\n  me to go back, even for a visit.

Or "<i>Pre-Register</i>" as they put it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I mean, who wouldn\'t, after watching <i>this</i>?</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That\'s seven minutes of action I find hard to believe is taken directly\nfrom the game. But it is, apparently. Obviously it\'s been edited but as far as I\ncan tell everything you see is gameplay footage.\n<p></p>\n<p>And so is this, which just landed on <i>YouTube</i>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That\'s ten minutes of "<i>Official Extended Gameplay</i>" that\nabsolutely looks like a movie. Specifically, the center-piece car chase from a\npretty good movie. A movie I would certainly watch.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  My question isn\'t "<i>Is this game going to be any good?</i>" or "<i>Will it be Pay-to-Win</i>?" or any of those obvious things gamers always ask. It\'s not even "<i>Will it run on my aging PC?</i>", although that\'s a valid concern.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, my question is "<i>How the hell is that even possible?</i>" Apart from the\n  oddly stilted walking animations, the video looks like a bunch of clips from a movie.\n  <i>MOP </i>described it as a "<i>sizzle reel</i>" and that\'s really what it\n  is.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  After watching it, I found myself thinking back to something that happened more than thirty years ago, which I\'ve never forgotten. I happened to go into large store in a nearby city and I was walking through\n  the electronics department when I saw, on a large screen (For those days.), a video\n  game playing. It was a castle in a fantasy forest and it looked like just a movie.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never found out what the game was or what it was running on and I can\'t even remember now how I knew it was a game not a film. I\'m pretty\n  sure if I could see it now it would look like something you\'d see in\n  a&nbsp;<i>PS1</i>game. It probably <i>was </i>a PS1 game. It would have been around that time. Whatever it was, it looked like the future. Well, it looked like the past, what with it being a fantasy castle and all, but the past seen through the lens of the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/s1280/anantagirl2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/w640-h448/anantagirl2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Technologically, we are all living in the future now and we take it for granted.\n  Things we pay no attention to or even get anoyed by today would have seemed like literal, actual magic just thirty years ago. If I find it hard to believe something\n  like Ananta can even be real today, imagine how I\'d have felt if I could have watched that trailer\n  in 1995!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Something I hear often these days is that improved graphics can only take the\n  games industry so far and that the limit may already have been reached. And that\'s\n  probably true, as far as it goes. But what\'s hard to believe about this\n  trailer isn\'t so much the visual quality, impressive though it is; it\'s the world-building.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what draws me in to all of these new games, all these new worlds, from\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i> to <i>Neverness To Everness</i> to Ananta: their\n  cinematic, novelistic storytelling. I see clips and I want to know who the\n  characters are, what their lives are like, what they\'re doing. It\'s not new\n  but it <i>seems </i>like it\'s new. It\'s the new future of our long, storytelling past.</p>\n<p>\n  Also, someone\'s bound to be wearing bunny ears in one of these things and that\'s always a\n  bonus. I\'d say you don\'t see <i>that </i>in real life but I saw two people wearing bunny ears in the street only this week...\n</p>\n<p>\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>On MMORPGs And Why They\'re Kinda Done</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  As big, mass-market affairs, that is. Not as small to medium sized niche services\n  servicing small to medium size niches. They\'re still good there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was\n  <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/#comment-330459"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">something <i>Redbeard </i>said</span></a>\n  in response to <i>Wilhelm</i>\'s post about <i>Ship of Heroes</i> yesterday\n  that started me thinking. For some reason, the conversation took a detour\n  into<i> Guild Wars 2 </i>and how a big part of the revenue system there relies\n  on persuading players to part with cash to remove the inconveniences the devs\n  have added in, seemingly for that exact purpose.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a well-known mechanic in many MMOs. The very unpopular version is to put\n  up obvious pay-walls for in-game services and systems most players believe\n  should be part of the core gameplay. <i>Star Wars: the Old Republic</i> used\n  to be the leader in that awkward field, charging money for everything up to\n  and including enough hot bars to fit your skills.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They toned that down over time and recently they\'ve cut it right back to\n  something closer to what players expected in the first place. It still leaves\n  a whole lot of less controversial money-making opportunities in place, though,\n  one of which is always storage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>GW2 </i>has always had a serious storage problem. The game isn\'t overly\n  generous with inventory space to begin with but it does allow you to expand it\n  in various ways, all of which are technically free. As Redbeard points out,\n  though, its much, much easier to get out your credit card and pay.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never did and that\'s because I played GW2 like an old-school MMORPG. I played for a decade, virtually every day, often for several hours at a time. Just playing normally and not spending any real money, I ended up with a huge amount of\n  inventory space across multiple accounts and characters. On my most-played\n  characters I had all the bag and bank slots you were allowed. I hit the point\n  where even real money wouldn\'t have gotten me any more and I hadn\'t paid a\n  dime.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/s307/gw2leg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="367" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/w640-h367/gw2leg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  It still wasn\'t enough. I made bigger bags and <i>that </i>wasn\'t enough. Nothing was\n<i>  ever </i>enough. GW2 doesn\'t just have a storage problem, it has a loot problem.\n  There\'s far, far, far too much of it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is also the key to <i>not </i>spending any money on storage. You have the\n  choice, as Wilhelm suggests, of just throwing everything away. That\'ll fix it\n  for free and right away. Or you can sell all of the good stuff you find and use the\n  gold to buy Gems, the cash shop currency, then use those Gems to buy more\n  storage space, which is what I did.\n</p>\n<p>\n  People complain all the time about not being able to make enough gold in GW2.\n  I made thousands, easily. I still have most of it because I made far more than I ever needed. I didn\'t make any special effort, either. I had\n  just two tricks for making gold:\n</p>\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\n  <li>\n    <b>Never, ever make any Legendaries. Sell all the mats for them you find to to those who do.</b></li>\n  <li><b>Play every hour god sends</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The first isn\'t a problem. It\'s just sensible. No-one needs Legendary items in\n  GW2. They do nothing for gameplay. They\'re convenience items and cosmetics. Let others waste their time and pay you for the privilege.</p>\n<p>\n  The second is the reason MMORPGs are and always will be a niche interest. They absolutely do not respect your time.&nbsp;</p><p>Redbeard has inventory problems he can only, rationally, solve by paying real\n  money because he doesn\'t play GW2 several hours a day, every day, year in, year out. If he did,\n  the problem would solve itself, at least until there were no more slots left to\n  buy with all that gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All MMORPGs are designed to be played for several hours a day, every day,\n  forever. That\'s the business model. The reason the genre is being lapped\n  by open-world RPGs and survival games is that those offer the same level\n  of intensity and immersion that made MMORPGs successful in the first place but they don\'t go on forever and ever and ever like an\n  eternal treadmill. They don\'t necessarily come with a Game Over title card but they\n  have clear end-points that feel like a satisfying place to stop. And they have clear on-ramps every\n  time they add DLC or major updates, meaning you can dip in and out without worrying about falling far behind.</p>\n<p>\n  Or something. It\'s a theory. I haven\'t really thought it through. Feel free to elaborate and iterate on it.</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">AI Ruins Everything</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s made a lot of people happy, I bet. I don\'t mean that it does. I mean that I said it. Do I mean it, though? Depends what you mean by "<i>AI</i>", doesn\'t it?</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Greg Morris</i>, whose blog I picked up in Blaugust, has\n  <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2025/09/24/i-did-it-myself.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a good take</span></a>\n  on it. He, like me, isn\'t existentially opposed to AI. He sees some merits\n  and uses, as do I. He\'s just not very impressed with what people are doing\n  with it just now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  "<i>Widespread usage of generative products, particularly ChatGPT, by many\n    people I come in contact with is making my life more difficult</i>" he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, mine too. All of ours, I bet.\n</p>\n<p>Like Greg, I am not as sanguine as I could be about my doctor\'s surgery\n  moving to an AI triage system. Neither am I convinced that having AI answer\n  the phone when I call to try and buy something is the best way of\n  handling a commercial transaction. Unlike Greg, I\'m happy to say I don\'t\n  encounter AI in my work although no doubt it\'s only a matter of time, but I\n  have very low confidence in any of the current LLMs being able to send emails\n  that wouldn\'t have gotten me into trouble if I\'d written them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What I do think, perhaps over-optimistically, is that the AIs will either\n  have to get a lot better or most of the companies and services that have\n  adopted them so quickly will have to drop them again pretty quickly too, probably\n  as soon as they notice how much money they\'re losing and how many lawsuits\n  they\'re picking up. Those No Win No Fee lawyers must just <i>love </i>AI.</p>\n<p>\n  This is all LLMs, though. They\'re the bad AIs. Generative AI as a whole may be\n  morally and ethically bad but only some of it is practically bad, too. The real problem with the rest is that it\'s getting to be too\n  good at what it does.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/s512/wtcf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/w640-h640/wtcf1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'ve been a fan of line art since I was a child. I\'ve spent well over half\n  a century developing a fairly well-trained eye and a reasonably informed,\n  historical understanding of line art and illustration, particularly comics. I\n  have a reliably-formatted emotional and aesthetic reaction to every such image I see that allows me to parse it and contextualize it by way of decades of exposure.</p>\n<p>\n  And I like some of the AI images I\'m seeing these days as well as or better than many, many similar\n  pictures I\'ve seen that were drawn by humans. Humans draw a lot of really bad line art and a lot of them don\'t know how bad it is.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn\'t matter if I know an image is by AI, either. It doesn\'t put me off. The image is the image (cf. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/intentional-fallacy"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Intentional Fallacy,</span></a> as always.) It\'s not\n  like I\'m being tricked into thinking a human did it. AI images of a certain\n  kind stimulate the same level of endorphin production or synaptic snap or whatever it is that\n  makes me look at a line drawing and get a warm, tingly feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Doubly so if\n  it\'s one I\'ve caused to be made myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If I was making my living by drawing pictures, that would piss me off. Or\n  maybe it wouldn\'t. Maybe I\'d just see AI as a new kind of pencil and start drawing with it. At the moment, there\'s resistance to commissioned AI art but will\n  that attitude last? In the end, don\'t people mostly want the right image for\n  the purpose they\'ve commissioned it? Is the provenance of the picture that important? And if your primary (Or ancillary.) motivation is to give work to the artist, does that have anything at all to do with aesthetics?</p>\n<p>\n  To some people, yes, obviously. But to the mass market? I doubt it. And I was\n  never going to commission anyone to draw anything anyway so it\'s a moot point\n  as far as my money is concerned.\n</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>\n  The same applies to generative AI and music, another field where I can claim a\n  longstanding interest. Or at least it applies to music <i>I\'ve</i> made with\n  AI, which I currently prefer to listen to over almost anything else.&nbsp;\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/s894/aihg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/w640-h448/aihg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  I have to say that I have yet to hear anything <i>made </i>by anyone else using AI that has\n  the same impact. Most of it is horrible. But I suspect that says more about\n  the musical tastes of the people who are making it than the capacity and\n  potential of the AIs. When people who like the kind of music I like start\n  making music with AI, I\'m pretty sure I\'ll find plenty to enjoy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Always assuming I even know, that is. If people don\'t say they used AI, who\'s going to know?&nbsp;</p><p>There are some free apps around that\n  purport to be able to tell if a song has been made by AI or not. I tried a\n  couple. I\'d give you the links but I forgot to bookmark them.</p>\n<p>\n  One is extremely accurate but that one works by analyzing the frequencies of the\n  sample you submit rather than trying to make any aesthetic judgments. It\'s undeniable that AI has a particular sonic signature you can hear once your ear attunes to it and there\'s a technical accuracy to the timing that human musicians don\'t always\n  achieve. I imagine that could be coded out if the people making AI wanted to\n  hide it.&nbsp;</p><p>That app, unsurprisingly, pegged everything I sent it as having been made by AI. Which it was. I should have dummied it with some human music but I was just dicking around, not running some kind of double-blind experiment.</p>\n<p>\n  The other app, which attempts something more along the lines of a critical analysis, looking at things like the structure and the lyrics as well as the music, was much less certain whether an AI was involved or not. It tended to\n  think most of the songs I was sending it were mostly done by a human.&nbsp;</p><p>And so\n  they were. I wrote all the words. I came up with all the melodies. I gave the\n  AI a guide vocal, which I made sure the AI followed very closely. In my opinion, those songs were indeed made by a human. A human using AI as an instrument.</p>\n<p>I suspect most of the AI music being made doesn\'t have that degree of human input behind it, though. An astonishing amount of AI music is being uploaded to streaming sites every\n  day. Millions of songs. Almost all of them made purely by AI from a short prompt.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see why the platforms might want to filter it\n  out.

She\n    shares the house and garden with a girl in her late teens called Cat, a\n    young woman of indefinable age called Cathy and a woman in her early\n    thirties called Rachel. Phoebe has never left the house and garden. She has\n    no memories of ever being anywhere else. She thinks she had a brother but\n    she doesn\'t really remember him. She reads, plays chess with Cat, and just\n    generally gets through the day. She believes Cat and Cathy are ghosts. She\n    believes she\'s a half-ghost. She believes Rachel is fully real. Cat is\n    friendly and kind to her. Cathy is drifty and vague but unafraid of anything\n    and protective of Phoebe. Rachel is often angry because she wants to leave\n    to get back to her friends, about whom she often talks, but she doesn\'t know\n    how to leave. Rachel, when she\'s in a good mood, creates firework displays\n    and makes snow fall so she and Phoebe can build snow statues of Rachel\'s\n    absent friends. One day, after this has been going on for a long time, two\n    of Rachel\'s friends, Sally and Cado Babe, appear in the garden and soon\n    after they and Rachel are gone.

Specifically, the center-piece car chase from a\npretty good movie. A movie I would certainly watch.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  My question isn\'t "<i>Is this game going to be any good?</i>" or "<i>Will it be Pay-to-Win</i>?" or any of those obvious things gamers always ask. It\'s not even "<i>Will it run on my aging PC?</i>", although that\'s a valid concern.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, my question is "<i>How the hell is that even possible?</i>" Apart from the\n  oddly stilted walking animations, the video looks like a bunch of clips from a movie.\n  <i>MOP </i>described it as a "<i>sizzle reel</i>" and that\'s really what it\n  is.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  After watching it, I found myself thinking back to something that happened more than thirty years ago, which I\'ve never forgotten. I happened to go into large store in a nearby city and I was walking through\n  the electronics department when I saw, on a large screen (For those days.), a video\n  game playing. It was a castle in a fantasy forest and it looked like just a movie.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never found out what the game was or what it was running on and I can\'t even remember now how I knew it was a game not a film. I\'m pretty\n  sure if I could see it now it would look like something you\'d see in\n  a&nbsp;<i>PS1</i>game. It probably <i>was </i>a PS1 game. It would have been around that time. Whatever it was, it looked like the future. Well, it looked like the past, what with it being a fantasy castle and all, but the past seen through the lens of the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/s1280/anantagirl2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/w640-h448/anantagirl2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Technologically, we are all living in the future now and we take it for granted.\n  Things we pay no attention to or even get anoyed by today would have seemed like literal, actual magic just thirty years ago. If I find it hard to believe something\n  like Ananta can even be real today, imagine how I\'d have felt if I could have watched that trailer\n  in 1995!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Something I hear often these days is that improved graphics can only take the\n  games industry so far and that the limit may already have been reached. And that\'s\n  probably true, as far as it goes. But what\'s hard to believe about this\n  trailer isn\'t so much the visual quality, impressive though it is; it\'s the world-building.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what draws me in to all of these new games, all these new worlds, from\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i> to <i>Neverness To Everness</i> to Ananta: their\n  cinematic, novelistic storytelling. I see clips and I want to know who the\n  characters are, what their lives are like, what they\'re doing. It\'s not new\n  but it <i>seems </i>like it\'s new. It\'s the new future of our long, storytelling past.</p>\n<p>\n  Also, someone\'s bound to be wearing bunny ears in one of these things and that\'s always a\n  bonus. I\'d say you don\'t see <i>that </i>in real life but I saw two people wearing bunny ears in the street only this week...\n</p>\n<p>\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>On MMORPGs And Why They\'re Kinda Done</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  As big, mass-market affairs, that is. Not as small to medium sized niche services\n  servicing small to medium size niches. They\'re still good there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was\n  <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/#comment-330459"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">something <i>Redbeard </i>said</span></a>\n  in response to <i>Wilhelm</i>\'s post about <i>Ship of Heroes</i> yesterday\n  that started me thinking. For some reason, the conversation took a detour\n  into<i> Guild Wars 2 </i>and how a big part of the revenue system there relies\n  on persuading players to part with cash to remove the inconveniences the devs\n  have added in, seemingly for that exact purpose.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a well-known mechanic in many MMOs. The very unpopular version is to put\n  up obvious pay-walls for in-game services and systems most players believe\n  should be part of the core gameplay. <i>Star Wars: the Old Republic</i> used\n  to be the leader in that awkward field, charging money for everything up to\n  and including enough hot bars to fit your skills.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They toned that down over time and recently they\'ve cut it right back to\n  something closer to what players expected in the first place. It still leaves\n  a whole lot of less controversial money-making opportunities in place, though,\n  one of which is always storage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>GW2 </i>has always had a serious storage problem. The game isn\'t overly\n  generous with inventory space to begin with but it does allow you to expand it\n  in various ways, all of which are technically free. As Redbeard points out,\n  though, its much, much easier to get out your credit card and pay.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never did and that\'s because I played GW2 like an old-school MMORPG. I played for a decade, virtually every day, often for several hours at a time. Just playing normally and not spending any real money, I ended up with a huge amount of\n  inventory space across multiple accounts and characters. On my most-played\n  characters I had all the bag and bank slots you were allowed. I hit the point\n  where even real money wouldn\'t have gotten me any more and I hadn\'t paid a\n  dime.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/s307/gw2leg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="367" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/w640-h367/gw2leg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  It still wasn\'t enough. I made bigger bags and <i>that </i>wasn\'t enough. Nothing was\n<i>  ever </i>enough. GW2 doesn\'t just have a storage problem, it has a loot problem.\n  There\'s far, far, far too much of it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is also the key to <i>not </i>spending any money on storage. You have the\n  choice, as Wilhelm suggests, of just throwing everything away. That\'ll fix it\n  for free and right away. Or you can sell all of the good stuff you find and use the\n  gold to buy Gems, the cash shop currency, then use those Gems to buy more\n  storage space, which is what I did.\n</p>\n<p>\n  People complain all the time about not being able to make enough gold in GW2.\n  I made thousands, easily. I still have most of it because I made far more than I ever needed. I didn\'t make any special effort, either. I had\n  just two tricks for making gold:\n</p>\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\n  <li>\n    <b>Never, ever make any Legendaries. Sell all the mats for them you find to to those who do.</b></li>\n  <li><b>Play every hour god sends</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The first isn\'t a problem. It\'s just sensible. No-one needs Legendary items in\n  GW2. They do nothing for gameplay. They\'re convenience items and cosmetics. Let others waste their time and pay you for the privilege.</p>\n<p>\n  The second is the reason MMORPGs are and always will be a niche interest. They absolutely do not respect your time.&nbsp;</p><p>Redbeard has inventory problems he can only, rationally, solve by paying real\n  money because he doesn\'t play GW2 several hours a day, every day, year in, year out. If he did,\n  the problem would solve itself, at least until there were no more slots left to\n  buy with all that gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All MMORPGs are designed to be played for several hours a day, every day,\n  forever. That\'s the business model. The reason the genre is being lapped\n  by open-world RPGs and survival games is that those offer the same level\n  of intensity and immersion that made MMORPGs successful in the first place but they don\'t go on forever and ever and ever like an\n  eternal treadmill. They don\'t necessarily come with a Game Over title card but they\n  have clear end-points that feel like a satisfying place to stop. And they have clear on-ramps every\n  time they add DLC or major updates, meaning you can dip in and out without worrying about falling far behind.</p>\n<p>\n  Or something. It\'s a theory. I haven\'t really thought it through. Feel free to elaborate and iterate on it.</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">AI Ruins Everything</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s made a lot of people happy, I bet. I don\'t mean that it does. I mean that I said it. Do I mean it, though? Depends what you mean by "<i>AI</i>", doesn\'t it?</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Greg Morris</i>, whose blog I picked up in Blaugust, has\n  <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2025/09/24/i-did-it-myself.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a good take</span></a>\n  on it. He, like me, isn\'t existentially opposed to AI. He sees some merits\n  and uses, as do I. He\'s just not very impressed with what people are doing\n  with it just now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  "<i>Widespread usage of generative products, particularly ChatGPT, by many\n    people I come in contact with is making my life more difficult</i>" he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, mine too. All of ours, I bet.\n</p>\n<p>Like Greg, I am not as sanguine as I could be about my doctor\'s surgery\n  moving to an AI triage system. Neither am I convinced that having AI answer\n  the phone when I call to try and buy something is the best way of\n  handling a commercial transaction. Unlike Greg, I\'m happy to say I don\'t\n  encounter AI in my work although no doubt it\'s only a matter of time, but I\n  have very low confidence in any of the current LLMs being able to send emails\n  that wouldn\'t have gotten me into trouble if I\'d written them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What I do think, perhaps over-optimistically, is that the AIs will either\n  have to get a lot better or most of the companies and services that have\n  adopted them so quickly will have to drop them again pretty quickly too, probably\n  as soon as they notice how much money they\'re losing and how many lawsuits\n  they\'re picking up. Those No Win No Fee lawyers must just <i>love </i>AI.</p>\n<p>\n  This is all LLMs, though. They\'re the bad AIs. Generative AI as a whole may be\n  morally and ethically bad but only some of it is practically bad, too. The real problem with the rest is that it\'s getting to be too\n  good at what it does.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/s512/wtcf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/w640-h640/wtcf1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'ve been a fan of line art since I was a child. I\'ve spent well over half\n  a century developing a fairly well-trained eye and a reasonably informed,\n  historical understanding of line art and illustration, particularly comics. I\n  have a reliably-formatted emotional and aesthetic reaction to every such image I see that allows me to parse it and contextualize it by way of decades of exposure.</p>\n<p>\n  And I like some of the AI images I\'m seeing these days as well as or better than many, many similar\n  pictures I\'ve seen that were drawn by humans. Humans draw a lot of really bad line art and a lot of them don\'t know how bad it is.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn\'t matter if I know an image is by AI, either. It doesn\'t put me off. The image is the image (cf. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/intentional-fallacy"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Intentional Fallacy,</span></a> as always.) It\'s not\n  like I\'m being tricked into thinking a human did it. AI images of a certain\n  kind stimulate the same level of endorphin production or synaptic snap or whatever it is that\n  makes me look at a line drawing and get a warm, tingly feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Doubly so if\n  it\'s one I\'ve caused to be made myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If I was making my living by drawing pictures, that would piss me off. Or\n  maybe it wouldn\'t. Maybe I\'d just see AI as a new kind of pencil and start drawing with it. At the moment, there\'s resistance to commissioned AI art but will\n  that attitude last? In the end, don\'t people mostly want the right image for\n  the purpose they\'ve commissioned it? Is the provenance of the picture that important? And if your primary (Or ancillary.) motivation is to give work to the artist, does that have anything at all to do with aesthetics?</p>\n<p>\n  To some people, yes, obviously. But to the mass market? I doubt it. And I was\n  never going to commission anyone to draw anything anyway so it\'s a moot point\n  as far as my money is concerned.\n</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>\n  The same applies to generative AI and music, another field where I can claim a\n  longstanding interest. Or at least it applies to music <i>I\'ve</i> made with\n  AI, which I currently prefer to listen to over almost anything else.&nbsp;\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/s894/aihg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/w640-h448/aihg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  I have to say that I have yet to hear anything <i>made </i>by anyone else using AI that has\n  the same impact. Most of it is horrible. But I suspect that says more about\n  the musical tastes of the people who are making it than the capacity and\n  potential of the AIs. When people who like the kind of music I like start\n  making music with AI, I\'m pretty sure I\'ll find plenty to enjoy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Always assuming I even know, that is. If people don\'t say they used AI, who\'s going to know?&nbsp;</p><p>There are some free apps around that\n  purport to be able to tell if a song has been made by AI or not. I tried a\n  couple. I\'d give you the links but I forgot to bookmark them.</p>\n<p>\n  One is extremely accurate but that one works by analyzing the frequencies of the\n  sample you submit rather than trying to make any aesthetic judgments. It\'s undeniable that AI has a particular sonic signature you can hear once your ear attunes to it and there\'s a technical accuracy to the timing that human musicians don\'t always\n  achieve. I imagine that could be coded out if the people making AI wanted to\n  hide it.&nbsp;</p><p>That app, unsurprisingly, pegged everything I sent it as having been made by AI. Which it was. I should have dummied it with some human music but I was just dicking around, not running some kind of double-blind experiment.</p>\n<p>\n  The other app, which attempts something more along the lines of a critical analysis, looking at things like the structure and the lyrics as well as the music, was much less certain whether an AI was involved or not. It tended to\n  think most of the songs I was sending it were mostly done by a human.&nbsp;</p><p>And so\n  they were. I wrote all the words. I came up with all the melodies. I gave the\n  AI a guide vocal, which I made sure the AI followed very closely. In my opinion, those songs were indeed made by a human. A human using AI as an instrument.</p>\n<p>I suspect most of the AI music being made doesn\'t have that degree of human input behind it, though. An astonishing amount of AI music is being uploaded to streaming sites every\n  day. Millions of songs. Almost all of them made purely by AI from a short prompt.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see why the platforms might want to filter it\n  out. Except, if their customers are happily listening to it, why would they\n  bother?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Bad pushes out good is the old saw.

It\'s rather better, I hope you\'ll agree.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Notes on AI Used in this post</b></p>\n<p>\n  Some of this is explained in the text but to be clear, the final image is from\n  Gemini\'s newish storybook feature. The full prompt for the whole thing was an\n  ad hoc precis of a whole series of fictional pieces I published in an APA back\n  in the 90s. At some point I will be posting the originals, complete with the\n  infinitely superior full text and collaged illustrations, so if you have any\n  interest, you might want to wait for that:\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;"<i>Please make me a picture book for adults about a girl called Phoebe, aged\n    about 12 or 13, who lives in a rambling old house with a walled garden. She\n    shares the house and garden with a girl in her late teens called Cat, a\n    young woman of indefinable age called Cathy and a woman in her early\n    thirties called Rachel. Phoebe has never left the house and garden. She has\n    no memories of ever being anywhere else. She thinks she had a brother but\n    she doesn\'t really remember him. She reads, plays chess with Cat, and just\n    generally gets through the day. She believes Cat and Cathy are ghosts. She\n    believes she\'s a half-ghost. She believes Rachel is fully real. Cat is\n    friendly and kind to her. Cathy is drifty and vague but unafraid of anything\n    and protective of Phoebe. Rachel is often angry because she wants to leave\n    to get back to her friends, about whom she often talks, but she doesn\'t know\n    how to leave. Rachel, when she\'s in a good mood, creates firework displays\n    and makes snow fall so she and Phoebe can build snow statues of Rachel\'s\n    absent friends. One day, after this has been going on for a long time, two\n    of Rachel\'s friends, Sally and Cado Babe, appear in the garden and soon\n    after they and Rachel are gone. Phoebe is left on her own with Cat and\n    Cathy. She wonders now if she, too, will ever leave. </i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The header image and the second one were both done with Google\'s\n  <i>Imagen 4.0</i> at NightCafe. For some reason, instead of taking a couple of\n  screenshots from the Ananta videos, I thought it would be amusing to have an\n  AI make them instead. The prompt for the top image was "<i>An anime girl dressed in blue with bunny ears riding in an electric blue\n    sports car along a freeway between the towering skyscrapers of a near-future\n    city. Bright sunshine, blue sky. Anime line art, bright flat\n    colors.</i>" For the second, I used the same prompt but added "<i>A dark-haired young man wearing sunglasses is beside her in the passenger\n    seat.</i>" All settings were left on whatever the defaults are.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The third image is one of the daily pictures I\'m still producing to keep my\n  NightCafe streak going.

There is! Here\'s how you do it...</p>\n<p>\n  Charge $60 for the (Non-existent.) box <i>and </i>demand&nbsp;fifteen dollars\n  a month to keep on playing after the first thirty days! That ought to do it!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ah, but is it enough? If your game is <i>really </i>good and has fantastic\n  word of mouth and the streamers are all plugging it like crazy and you\'ve\n  picked out a spot in the market where there\'s no direct competition, maybe\n  you\'ll still find yourself overwhelmed by hordes of frantic players throwing\n  money at you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, just to be safe, why not go head-to-head with the free-to-play game that\n  inspired the one you just spent years on? And why not make sure your\n  AAA-priced version of that familiar title looks like "<i>a relic of a bygone era</i>", specifically "<i>the early 00\'s</i>". Make sure it\'s "<i>worse than games released 2 decades ago</i>" and be sure it plays&nbsp;"<i>like a student project or an alpha build with a bunch of placeholders for\n    real icons, graphics, sound effects, systems, and so on</i>".&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not my words, just a few choice quotes from the <i>Steam </i>reviews, where\n  <i>Ship of Heroes</i> (Aww - you guessed...) is currently enjoying a rating of\n  <i>Mostly Negative </i>from forty-eight reviews.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And since everyone really <i>loves </i>AI these days, especially gamers, why\n  not use it instead of actual actors for your NPC voice acting? That last\n  allegation appears to have been disputed by the developers but the general\n  impression is that the voice acting is "<i>awful</i>" no matter whether humans\n  or machines are doing it, so it probably doesn\'t matter much either way.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that in place (And a lot more besides.) it\'s safe to assume your\n  players won\'t run into any of those all-too-familiar launch day issues. Your\n  servers will almost certainly be able to withstand the strain of the teens of\n  people willing to stump up the cost of<i> Baldurs Gate 3 </i>for a chance to\n  play "<i>a buggy mess</i>" for a month before having to get their credit cards\n  out once more for the right to carry on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If nothing else, you\'ll certainly be able to claim you had no queues at launch\n  and everyone was able to log straight in.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/s600/soh4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/w640-h360/soh4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was going to post something more high-minded about all this but\n  <i>Wilhelm </i>got there before me so I took the low road. For a less snarky\n  take on the situation I refer you to\n  <i><a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">TAGN</span></a></i>. I do have a few semi-serious observations of my own to make, though.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1890100/Ship_of_Heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Ship of Heroes</span></a>\n  launched yesterday to a largely disinterested gaming public, most of whom had\n  probably only heard of the game at all thanks to the recent flurry of\n  (Negative.) press interest generated by open disbelief at the price point. If\n  the plan was to raise the game\'s profile then I suppose they achieved it but I\n  suspect they may be learning there is such a thing as bad publicity after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game is available through Steam and only through Steam, so for once we\n  have an MMORPG whose exact population is relatively easy to ascertain.\n  <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1890100/charts/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The numbers are in</span></a>\n  and they are not pretty.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;The "<i>All Time</i>" (By which we mean two days.) peak stands at a tidy\n  100. As I type this, there are sixteen players online.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just for contrast,<i> Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen</i>, which entered Early\n  Access on Steam last December at a box price of $39.99, has an all-time\n  peak of just under 7,000 players with five hundred people playing right now.\n  That sounds like it might be a viable business model. This does not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Then again, who am I to say? I played both games, very briefly, in open\n  testing and decided not to pay much more attention to either of them. I might\n  have been the target market once but that seems a very long time ago now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It would also be ridiculous of me to pretend to be surprised by how the Ship\n  of Heroes launch is going. Apart from that irritating clique that seems to\n  think everything is de facto better the more pointlessly exclusive you make\n  it, there has been universal incomprehension at the business model\n  <i>Heroic Games </i>has chosen. No-one expected it to pay off and it has\n  exceeded even those expectations. Or fallen below them. However that goes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not even really surprised to hear the game is janky, buggy and crashes a\n  lot, as many reviews on Steam complain. I\n  <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2023/10/shape-up-or-ship-out.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">reviewed </span></a>one of the tests a couple of years ago and made many of the same observations\n  then. It seems little has changed.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxBJZnrl0MREgjZaF_e3nCVc3s4eAUIgYvkwtj2Cod6h3yrP8xFqBHKUnzu_hDzIQcphsK6gl0FQYX-StGdqHTRjKt3aIFzALjHcpA3MUXyVW7H1yym9WznRbrTVpFEjnfVyGhKbnXj4kddIKqekVha_Av9VaK2JIZMTgLdOIEhqO7ZoTHzCOVxVlLUXg/s600/soh5.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxBJZnrl0MREgjZaF_e3nCVc3s4eAUIgYvkwtj2Cod6h3yrP8xFqBHKUnzu_hDzIQcphsK6gl0FQYX-StGdqHTRjKt3aIFzALjHcpA3MUXyVW7H1yym9WznRbrTVpFEjnfVyGhKbnXj4kddIKqekVha_Av9VaK2JIZMTgLdOIEhqO7ZoTHzCOVxVlLUXg/w640-h360/soh5.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Perhaps surprisingly, I wasn\'t entirely negative back then. I ended my review\n  by saying "<i>For all its many flaws, I quite enjoyed it. If and when it reaches some\n    kind of always-up, no-more-wipes state - open beta or Early Access, let\'s\n    say - I might be willing to give it an extended run - if they fix the most\n    egregious of the technical issues, that is.</i>"&nbsp;I was clearly not expecting to be asked to pay sixty dollars for what\n  sounds like much the same build, let alone another fifteen a month in\n  perpetuity.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The thing is, I\'d quite like a good super-hero game. I\'ve been a fan of the\n  genre since early childhood. I read the comics. I watch the TV shows and the\n  movies. I even play one of the existing super-hero games, now and again. I\n  ought to be an easy mark for something like this.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If Ship of Heroes had launched on Steam with an Early Access model with a\n  modest buy-in I <i>might</i> have considered it. I considered Pantheon but\n  thought the box price was a little steep. At $20 I\'d have been there for\n  launch.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I still keep it in mind in case of a sale, though. It\'s on my Steam Wishlist\n  for that very reason. I\'d at least have done that much for <i>SoH</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If SoH had arrived on Steam as a F2P title, instead of this you\'d be reading\n  my First Impressions piece by now. I\'d certainly have been interested enough\n  to download it and give it a session or two.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Maybe I\'d have been disappointed. Maybe I\'d have made some negative comments.\n  Still, I bet I\'d have found a few good things to say, like I did with the\n  tests. The goodwill would have been there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  No-one who isn\'t delusional is going to give much goodwill to a game that\n  plays like a poorly-optimized, unpolished indie title but asks you to pay the\n  price you\'d expect to give for a triple-A critical darling. And then piles a\n  monthly sub on top of that. If you\'re looking to create bad word of mouth,\n  that\'s the way to go about it.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiamx0hhroFVUriNXuuSA65hf0UKVCOCgosHqdGQc5Cu5n1akAICTxQsPvc6hoYEXplHSW1RuFUvNRxEf6hwL-siV0f-QWr3gELN9ZX5W0YP6Qj5Do5JiMCDH6KvwmSOFPIkWF6PXUzsndoStwId_KqGGGJUwbyBVpXcQhvZ-Eb1PFp2hOs_8geSaV3Aco/s600/soh6.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiamx0hhroFVUriNXuuSA65hf0UKVCOCgosHqdGQc5Cu5n1akAICTxQsPvc6hoYEXplHSW1RuFUvNRxEf6hwL-siV0f-QWr3gELN9ZX5W0YP6Qj5Do5JiMCDH6KvwmSOFPIkWF6PXUzsndoStwId_KqGGGJUwbyBVpXcQhvZ-Eb1PFp2hOs_8geSaV3Aco/w640-h360/soh6.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  When you come in with a pricing structure like that, you have to expect to be\n  compared to the&nbsp; peer group that lives where you\'ve gone: household\n  names, famous I.P.s, celebrity game designers. You\'re competing with games\n  that win awards and break sales records for their innovation and execution.\n  You don\'t get your slack cut just because you\'re a plucky little indie\n  everyone\'s rooting for. Not in that company.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Where Ship of Heroes goes from here is hard to guess. You\'d think it would be\n  game over, so to speak, but I can quote you the names of half a dozen MMORPGs\n  that have been trundling along with single-figure populations for years. You\n  wouldn\'t recognize any of the names because they\'re super-obscure but they\'re\n  out there.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even some of the better-known ones have numbers similar to Ship of Heroes. Go\n  check how <i>Anarchy Online</i> is doing on Steam these days. Or\n  <i>Rose Online</i>. Although, both of those can be played outside the Steam\n  infrastructure, so it may not be a fair comparison. Also, they\'ve been around\n  for decades. They didn\'t just launch yesterday.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It is possible Ship of Heroes will drift along the bottom of the genre, played\n  by few and forgotten by all. I kind of hope so because as I said, there is\n  potential there, somewhere. It\'s hard to imagine it will ever be realized but\n  I guess it\'s possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if the bugs are squashed and the jank eliminated and the proposed DLC\n  (Free with cost of purchase for two years, if that\'s all you were waiting to\n  hear before slapping your cash on the table...) ever materialize, there\'s\n  still the uncomfortable fact that this is a game no-one was really asking\n  for.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The whole point of Ship of Heroes and the other two would-be wearers of the\n  <i>City of Heroes</i> cape was that they would be a new home for all those\n  players who couldn\'t play the game they loved any more, thanks to\n  <i>NCSoft </i>doing what NCSoft does and shutting it down.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except <i>CoH </i>resurfaced, the same as it ever was, and through some\n  hitherto unsuspected super-power, managed to convince its former corporate\n  overlords not only to let it stick around but to hand it its legal papers,\n  allowing the <i>Homecoming </i>server to provide a genuine, enduring home for\n  all those players who thought they\'d never go home again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And who needs a ship when you\'ve got a home? Especially an overpriced cruise\n  ship, sailing round in ever-decreasing circles.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n  <i><span style="font-size: x-small;">[All screenshots from the Steam Store Page and I have to say they make\n      the game look a lot better than the reviews suggest...]&nbsp;</span></i>\n</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgB56OgKW9klfMXg6Q9hK4XfhqjRPCbTMm0dHf_ZemxcymiLUVybC6_4Hft4T7yRF4yVRlwlhOBoQNKY27Jgbdts3IsGN4uQvRh5uuQ5gvFJbjdnJ60GWpweWWkZtbTg50QWFAgqkPUpdyccBU12Ri7xhEB_lNIxb-Wx8W8pWBTKMVi-pfw15HpnyZ_7Go/s600/soh3.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgB56OgKW9klfMXg6Q9hK4XfhqjRPCbTMm0dHf_ZemxcymiLUVybC6_4Hft4T7yRF4yVRlwlhOBoQNKY27Jgbdts3IsGN4uQvRh5uuQ5gvFJbjdnJ60GWpweWWkZtbTg50QWFAgqkPUpdyccBU12Ri7xhEB_lNIxb-Wx8W8pWBTKMVi-pfw15HpnyZ_7Go/w640-h360/soh3.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />It\'s always an exciting day when a new MMORPG launches, isn\'t it?

That last\n  allegation appears to have been disputed by the developers but the general\n  impression is that the voice acting is "<i>awful</i>" no matter whether humans\n  or machines are doing it, so it probably doesn\'t matter much either way.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that in place (And a lot more besides.) it\'s safe to assume your\n  players won\'t run into any of those all-too-familiar launch day issues. Your\n  servers will almost certainly be able to withstand the strain of the teens of\n  people willing to stump up the cost of<i> Baldurs Gate 3 </i>for a chance to\n  play "<i>a buggy mess</i>" for a month before having to get their credit cards\n  out once more for the right to carry on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If nothing else, you\'ll certainly be able to claim you had no queues at launch\n  and everyone was able to log straight in.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/s600/soh4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/w640-h360/soh4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was going to post something more high-minded about all this but\n  <i>Wilhelm </i>got there before me so I took the low road. For a less snarky\n  take on the situation I refer you to\n  <i><a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">TAGN</span></a></i>. I do have a few semi-serious observations of my own to make, though.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1890100/Ship_of_Heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Ship of Heroes</span></a>\n  launched yesterday to a largely disinterested gaming public, most of whom had\n  probably only heard of the game at all thanks to the recent flurry of\n  (Negative.) press interest generated by open disbelief at the price point. If\n  the plan was to raise the game\'s profile then I suppose they achieved it but I\n  suspect they may be learning there is such a thing as bad publicity after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game is available through Steam and only through Steam, so for once we\n  have an MMORPG whose exact population is relatively easy to ascertain.\n  <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1890100/charts/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The numbers are in</span></a>\n  and they are not pretty.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;The "<i>All Time</i>" (By which we mean two days.) peak stands at a tidy\n  100. As I type this, there are sixteen players online.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just for contrast,<i> Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen</i>, which entered Early\n  Access on Steam last December at a box price of $39.99, has an all-time\n  peak of just under 7,000 players with five hundred people playing right now.\n  That sounds like it might be a viable business model. This does not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Then again, who am I to say? I played both games, very briefly, in open\n  testing and decided not to pay much more attention to either of them. I might\n  have been the target market once but that seems a very long time ago now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It would also be ridiculous of me to pretend to be surprised by how the Ship\n  of Heroes launch is going. Apart from that irritating clique that seems to\n  think everything is de facto better the more pointlessly exclusive you make\n  it, there has been universal incomprehension at the business model\n  <i>Heroic Games </i>has chosen. No-one expected it to pay off and it has\n  exceeded even those expectations. Or fallen below them. However that goes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not even really surprised to hear the game is janky, buggy and crashes a\n  lot, as many reviews on Steam complain. I\n  <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2023/10/shape-up-or-ship-out.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">reviewed </span></a>one of the tests a couple of years ago and made many of the same observations\n  then. It seems little has changed.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxBJZnrl0MREgjZaF_e3nCVc3s4eAUIgYvkwtj2Cod6h3yrP8xFqBHKUnzu_hDzIQcphsK6gl0FQYX-StGdqHTRjKt3aIFzALjHcpA3MUXyVW7H1yym9WznRbrTVpFEjnfVyGhKbnXj4kddIKqekVha_Av9VaK2JIZMTgLdOIEhqO7ZoTHzCOVxVlLUXg/s600/soh5.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxBJZnrl0MREgjZaF_e3nCVc3s4eAUIgYvkwtj2Cod6h3yrP8xFqBHKUnzu_hDzIQcphsK6gl0FQYX-StGdqHTRjKt3aIFzALjHcpA3MUXyVW7H1yym9WznRbrTVpFEjnfVyGhKbnXj4kddIKqekVha_Av9VaK2JIZMTgLdOIEhqO7ZoTHzCOVxVlLUXg/w640-h360/soh5.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Perhaps surprisingly, I wasn\'t entirely negative back then. I ended my review\n  by saying "<i>For all its many flaws, I quite enjoyed it. If and when it reaches some\n    kind of always-up, no-more-wipes state - open beta or Early Access, let\'s\n    say - I might be willing to give it an extended run - if they fix the most\n    egregious of the technical issues, that is.</i>"&nbsp;I was clearly not expecting to be asked to pay sixty dollars for what\n  sounds like much the same build, let alone another fifteen a month in\n  perpetuity.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The thing is, I\'d quite like a good super-hero game. I\'ve been a fan of the\n  genre since early childhood. I read the comics. I watch the TV shows and the\n  movies. I even play one of the existing super-hero games, now and again. I\n  ought to be an easy mark for something like this.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If Ship of Heroes had launched on Steam with an Early Access model with a\n  modest buy-in I <i>might</i> have considered it. I considered Pantheon but\n  thought the box price was a little steep. At $20 I\'d have been there for\n  launch.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I still keep it in mind in case of a sale, though. It\'s on my Steam Wishlist\n  for that very reason. I\'d at least have done that much for <i>SoH</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If SoH had arrived on Steam as a F2P title, instead of this you\'d be reading\n  my First Impressions piece by now. I\'d certainly have been interested enough\n  to download it and give it a session or two.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Maybe I\'d have been disappointed. Maybe I\'d have made some negative comments.\n  Still, I bet I\'d have found a few good things to say, like I did with the\n  tests. The goodwill would have been there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  No-one who isn\'t delusional is going to give much goodwill to a game that\n  plays like a poorly-optimized, unpolished indie title but asks you to pay the\n  price you\'d expect to give for a triple-A critical darling. And then piles a\n  monthly sub on top of that. If you\'re looking to create bad word of mouth,\n  that\'s the way to go about it.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiamx0hhroFVUriNXuuSA65hf0UKVCOCgosHqdGQc5Cu5n1akAICTxQsPvc6hoYEXplHSW1RuFUvNRxEf6hwL-siV0f-QWr3gELN9ZX5W0YP6Qj5Do5JiMCDH6KvwmSOFPIkWF6PXUzsndoStwId_KqGGGJUwbyBVpXcQhvZ-Eb1PFp2hOs_8geSaV3Aco/s600/soh6.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiamx0hhroFVUriNXuuSA65hf0UKVCOCgosHqdGQc5Cu5n1akAICTxQsPvc6hoYEXplHSW1RuFUvNRxEf6hwL-siV0f-QWr3gELN9ZX5W0YP6Qj5Do5JiMCDH6KvwmSOFPIkWF6PXUzsndoStwId_KqGGGJUwbyBVpXcQhvZ-Eb1PFp2hOs_8geSaV3Aco/w640-h360/soh6.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  When you come in with a pricing structure like that, you have to expect to be\n  compared to the&nbsp; peer group that lives where you\'ve gone: household\n  names, famous I.P.s, celebrity game designers. You\'re competing with games\n  that win awards and break sales records for their innovation and execution.\n  You don\'t get your slack cut just because you\'re a plucky little indie\n  everyone\'s rooting for. Not in that company.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Where Ship of Heroes goes from here is hard to guess. You\'d think it would be\n  game over, so to speak, but I can quote you the names of half a dozen MMORPGs\n  that have been trundling along with single-figure populations for years. You\n  wouldn\'t recognize any of the names because they\'re super-obscure but they\'re\n  out there.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even some of the better-known ones have numbers similar to Ship of Heroes. Go\n  check how <i>Anarchy Online</i> is doing on Steam these days. Or\n  <i>Rose Online</i>. Although, both of those can be played outside the Steam\n  infrastructure, so it may not be a fair comparison. Also, they\'ve been around\n  for decades. They didn\'t just launch yesterday.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It is possible Ship of Heroes will drift along the bottom of the genre, played\n  by few and forgotten by all. I kind of hope so because as I said, there is\n  potential there, somewhere. It\'s hard to imagine it will ever be realized but\n  I guess it\'s possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if the bugs are squashed and the jank eliminated and the proposed DLC\n  (Free with cost of purchase for two years, if that\'s all you were waiting to\n  hear before slapping your cash on the table...) ever materialize, there\'s\n  still the uncomfortable fact that this is a game no-one was really asking\n  for.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The whole point of Ship of Heroes and the other two would-be wearers of the\n  <i>City of Heroes</i> cape was that they would be a new home for all those\n  players who couldn\'t play the game they loved any more, thanks to\n  <i>NCSoft </i>doing what NCSoft does and shutting it down.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except <i>CoH </i>resurfaced, the same as it ever was, and through some\n  hitherto unsuspected super-power, managed to convince its former corporate\n  overlords not only to let it stick around but to hand it its legal papers,\n  allowing the <i>Homecoming </i>server to provide a genuine, enduring home for\n  all those players who thought they\'d never go home again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And who needs a ship when you\'ve got a home? Especially an overpriced cruise\n  ship, sailing round in ever-decreasing circles.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n  <i><span style="font-size: x-small;">[All screenshots from the Steam Store Page and I have to say they make\n      the game look a lot better than the reviews suggest...]&nbsp;</span></i>\n</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/welcome-to-ship-of-heroes-come-aboard.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/welcome-to-ship-of-heroes-come-aboard.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgB56OgKW9klfMXg6Q9hK4XfhqjRPCbTMm0dHf_ZemxcymiLUVybC6_4Hft4T7yRF4yVRlwlhOBoQNKY27Jgbdts3IsGN4uQvRh5uuQ5gvFJbjdnJ60GWpweWWkZtbTg50QWFAgqkPUpdyccBU12Ri7xhEB_lNIxb-Wx8W8pWBTKMVi-pfw15HpnyZ_7Go/s72-w640-h360-c/soh3.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '8'}

We\'ve reached the point where I\'d pretty much stopped making new characters, or at any rate new characters I had any real intention of playing. I didn\'t stop playing <i>EQ</i>, I just mostly relied on the characters I already had and any new ones I made were mainly to try out various retro servers or to perform basic admin functions like banking.</p><p>In order of creation, the Final <strike>Five </strike>Six are:&nbsp;</p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">20 - Nikolaiovitch</span> - <span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 18)</span></b> - <b><i>Born 6 January 2006 - Played 14 hours 45 minutes</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">21 - Lyrielle </span></b>- <b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 35)</span><i>&nbsp;- Born 29 June 2006 -&nbsp;Played&nbsp;6 days 6 hours</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">22 - Woolhat </span></b>-<span style="font-size: medium;"> </span><b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 23)</span><i> - Born 20 July 2008 -&nbsp;Played 8 hours 30 minutes</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">23 - Gladwaller</span> </b>- <b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 85) </span><i>-&nbsp;Born 22 August 2008 -&nbsp;Played 1 day 17 hours</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">24 - Cofferstone </span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 2)</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></b>- <i><b>Born 7 March 2015 -&nbsp;Played 1 day 9 hours</b></i></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">25 - Telza</span> </b>-<b><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>&nbsp;</i>(Level 85)</span><i> Born 17 March 2017 -&nbsp;Played&nbsp;&nbsp;3 hours 23 minutes</i></b></p><p><i>Nikolaiovitch </i>is the Gnome Necromancer I made to replicate my original Gnome Necromancer, <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/08/7-nickolai-born-9-march-2000-29-days-1.html"><i>Nickolai</i></a></span>. I don\'t have any clear memory of exactly why I needed another Necro at the start of 2006 and with a played time of a little less than fifteen hours, I clearly never did much with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Since he\'s currently on <i>Luclin-Stromm</i>, the home of the bulk of my most regularly-played characters over the last twenty years, I\'m guessing I had some plan to level him up that never really went anywhere. I have the vaguest memory that I ended up not liking the way I\'d made his name so similar to a much more established character and that it put me off playing him but I probably didn\'t need much of an excuse to leave him where he is now, in <i>the Bazaar, </i>hanging around the bank.</p><p>If Nickolaiovitch is a bit of a mystery, <i>Lyrielle </i>is a giant enigma. I have no memory of her whatsoever and yet she\'s somehow managed to get to Level 35, with over six days played. That\'s a hundred and fifty hours of online time and looking at her skills I can see she\'s been played normally for pretty much all of that, which is at least fifty full-length sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>Her casting skills are all close to maxed for her level, she\'s worked on tailoring some, she\'s almost maxed in Forage. Her bags have stacks of fish scales, suggesting she\'s done some fishing in her time. She\'s wearing a mish-mash of exactly the kind of gear I\'d expect one of my characters to have if they\'d been played properly or at least the way I usually play.</p><p>And yet I remember nothing about her at all. She\'s another Druid, so nothing about the gameplay would have been likely to have stuck in my memory. She\'s on <i>Xegony/Druzil Ro</i>, two servers I have never knowingly played on, although Xegony is where Mrs Bhagpuss and I ended up moving our <i>Ant. Bayle</i> crew, right before we stopped playing them altogether.</p><p>The only real clue is her birth month, June 2006. Thanks to the extremely useful <a href="https://bonzz.com/eqservers.htm"><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><i>EverQuest Servers</i> list </span></a>at <i>Bonzz.com</i>. I\'m able to say that two new servers launched that month - <i>The Combine</i> and <i>The Sleeper.</i>&nbsp;As I write, a faint memory is coming back to me that I did indeed play on The Combine when it launched and Bonzz notes that The Combine was merged into Druzzil Ro three years later, which is pretty conclusive proof that Lyrielle was the character I played.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCD-_8_o8eNrgr63e_gNVNTmR09K9VxW9bAXzNK7ptntJcHuBmtzVxtGzJZOMwABeZtoAYsv9nL8zBwVdoWgbZmBB7ShcENx4i3J4avirIZMzkWc_qfi0mHSjNG0qvZPsYJ4zmgIu4H4UapNGCEKXWiPZI03YQ7Xe32SRtGmnO1_LfpvrwcTvHpN8ZEy8/s1313/eqlyrielle1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="370" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCD-_8_o8eNrgr63e_gNVNTmR09K9VxW9bAXzNK7ptntJcHuBmtzVxtGzJZOMwABeZtoAYsv9nL8zBwVdoWgbZmBB7ShcENx4i3J4avirIZMzkWc_qfi0mHSjNG0qvZPsYJ4zmgIu4H4UapNGCEKXWiPZI03YQ7Xe32SRtGmnO1_LfpvrwcTvHpN8ZEy8/w640-h370/eqlyrielle1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>So, it appears that in the summer of 2006 I made a new druid to play on a new TLP/Classic/Level Restricted server and stuck it out long enough to get her to Level 35, which would have required some fairly serious commitment. A hundred and fifty hours\' worth, in fact. That means I must have played Lyrielle for longer than nearly every game on my <i>Steam </i>account - and I still can\'t tell you a damn thing about her!</p><p>I can\'t even remember why she\'s called Lyrielle. Most of my characters are named for some other character in some book I read and this certainly sounds like one of those names but it\'s not ringing any bells at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With <i>Woolhat</i>, on the other hand, I know exactly where the name comes from. He\'s an Iksar Monk and he used to be called <i>Nesmith</i>. Then there was some server merge or other and he ended up with an X on the end of his name so I renamed him Woolhat.&nbsp;</p><p>I imagine most people reading this (People read this stuff?!) don\'t need any further explanation but for the few that may, <i>Mike Nesmith</i> was one of<i> the Monkees</i> and I thought it was clever to name a Monk after a Monkee. I bet no-one else ever thought of that! And his nickname in the TV show was Woolhat. Because he always wore a wool hat. So the renaming was even cleverer!&nbsp;</p><p>(The Monkees were a pop group. They had a TV show in the sixties. Ask your grandparents.)</p><p>Nesmith/Woolhat did get played a little but for the longest time his main function has been as one of my Bazaar traders and bankers. He holds and sells a lot of stuff for other characters. These days, hold it is all he does because I haven\'t set him to trade for years. But he\'s happy enough.</p><p><i>Gladwaller</i>, it will surprise no-one to know, has been boosted. I didn\'t level him to 85. He was played, though, for a while, before that happened. He\'s a Gnome Enchanter and I made him when I fancied playing the class and didn\'t have one to hand. I messed around with him for a bit and got him into the teens or twenties then dropped him, I think because we moved servers.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no clue why I boosted him years later. The idea of jumping in at Level 85 and trying to play an Enchanter, either solo or in a group, is just fatuous. Maybe I wanted a buff-bot. I\'m pretty sure he\'s never left <i>Plane of Knowledge </i>since he drank the potion.</p><p>His name would appear to be <a href="https://salinger.org/characters/gladwaller/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">taken </span></a>from <i>J.D. Salinger</i>, which would make him my most literary of steals. As a massive Salinger fan, I may well have chosen it deliberately because of that, although I don\'t recall doing it. More likely I just had the name in mind from reading some Salinger around the same time.</p><p><i>Cofferstone</i>\'s name probably comes from <i>Frances Hardinge</i>\'s&nbsp; <i>Fly By Night</i> or<i> Twilight Robbery</i>, two excellent novels from which I\'ve borrowed several names for characters in various games.

No, this is the final installment in my much-delayed series commemorating <i>EverQuest</i>\'s twenty-fifth anniversary. If the filings from the <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/22/daybreak-wins-a-preliminary-injunction-against-the-heroes-journey/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">ongoing lawsuit</span></a> against pirate server <i>The Heroes\' Journey</i> are any indication, we may not get to the thirtieth so I guess I ought to get on with wrapping this up before it\'s too late.<p></p><p>And as I intimated last time, I\'m going to bundle the remaining characters up into one post because I don\'t have an awful lot to say about any of them. We\'ve reached the point where I\'d pretty much stopped making new characters, or at any rate new characters I had any real intention of playing. I didn\'t stop playing <i>EQ</i>, I just mostly relied on the characters I already had and any new ones I made were mainly to try out various retro servers or to perform basic admin functions like banking.</p><p>In order of creation, the Final <strike>Five </strike>Six are:&nbsp;</p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">20 - Nikolaiovitch</span> - <span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 18)</span></b> - <b><i>Born 6 January 2006 - Played 14 hours 45 minutes</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">21 - Lyrielle </span></b>- <b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 35)</span><i>&nbsp;- Born 29 June 2006 -&nbsp;Played&nbsp;6 days 6 hours</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">22 - Woolhat </span></b>-<span style="font-size: medium;"> </span><b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 23)</span><i> - Born 20 July 2008 -&nbsp;Played 8 hours 30 minutes</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">23 - Gladwaller</span> </b>- <b><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 85) </span><i>-&nbsp;Born 22 August 2008 -&nbsp;Played 1 day 17 hours</i></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">24 - Cofferstone </span><span style="font-size: medium;">(Level 2)</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></b>- <i><b>Born 7 March 2015 -&nbsp;Played 1 day 9 hours</b></i></p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">25 - Telza</span> </b>-<b><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>&nbsp;</i>(Level 85)</span><i> Born 17 March 2017 -&nbsp;Played&nbsp;&nbsp;3 hours 23 minutes</i></b></p><p><i>Nikolaiovitch </i>is the Gnome Necromancer I made to replicate my original Gnome Necromancer, <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/08/7-nickolai-born-9-march-2000-29-days-1.html"><i>Nickolai</i></a></span>. I don\'t have any clear memory of exactly why I needed another Necro at the start of 2006 and with a played time of a little less than fifteen hours, I clearly never did much with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Since he\'s currently on <i>Luclin-Stromm</i>, the home of the bulk of my most regularly-played characters over the last twenty years, I\'m guessing I had some plan to level him up that never really went anywhere. I have the vaguest memory that I ended up not liking the way I\'d made his name so similar to a much more established character and that it put me off playing him but I probably didn\'t need much of an excuse to leave him where he is now, in <i>the Bazaar, </i>hanging around the bank.</p><p>If Nickolaiovitch is a bit of a mystery, <i>Lyrielle </i>is a giant enigma. I have no memory of her whatsoever and yet she\'s somehow managed to get to Level 35, with over six days played. That\'s a hundred and fifty hours of online time and looking at her skills I can see she\'s been played normally for pretty much all of that, which is at least fifty full-length sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>Her casting skills are all close to maxed for her level, she\'s worked on tailoring some, she\'s almost maxed in Forage. Her bags have stacks of fish scales, suggesting she\'s done some fishing in her time. She\'s wearing a mish-mash of exactly the kind of gear I\'d expect one of my characters to have if they\'d been played properly or at least the way I usually play.</p><p>And yet I remember nothing about her at all. She\'s another Druid, so nothing about the gameplay would have been likely to have stuck in my memory. She\'s on <i>Xegony/Druzil Ro</i>, two servers I have never knowingly played on, although Xegony is where Mrs Bhagpuss and I ended up moving our <i>Ant. Bayle</i> crew, right before we stopped playing them altogether.</p><p>The only real clue is her birth month, June 2006. Thanks to the extremely useful <a href="https://bonzz.com/eqservers.htm"><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><i>EverQuest Servers</i> list </span></a>at <i>Bonzz.com</i>. I\'m able to say that two new servers launched that month - <i>The Combine</i> and <i>The Sleeper.</i>&nbsp;As I write, a faint memory is coming back to me that I did indeed play on The Combine when it launched and Bonzz notes that The Combine was merged into Druzzil Ro three years later, which is pretty conclusive proof that Lyrielle was the character I played.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCD-_8_o8eNrgr63e_gNVNTmR09K9VxW9bAXzNK7ptntJcHuBmtzVxtGzJZOMwABeZtoAYsv9nL8zBwVdoWgbZmBB7ShcENx4i3J4avirIZMzkWc_qfi0mHSjNG0qvZPsYJ4zmgIu4H4UapNGCEKXWiPZI03YQ7Xe32SRtGmnO1_LfpvrwcTvHpN8ZEy8/s1313/eqlyrielle1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="370" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCD-_8_o8eNrgr63e_gNVNTmR09K9VxW9bAXzNK7ptntJcHuBmtzVxtGzJZOMwABeZtoAYsv9nL8zBwVdoWgbZmBB7ShcENx4i3J4avirIZMzkWc_qfi0mHSjNG0qvZPsYJ4zmgIu4H4UapNGCEKXWiPZI03YQ7Xe32SRtGmnO1_LfpvrwcTvHpN8ZEy8/w640-h370/eqlyrielle1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>So, it appears that in the summer of 2006 I made a new druid to play on a new TLP/Classic/Level Restricted server and stuck it out long enough to get her to Level 35, which would have required some fairly serious commitment. A hundred and fifty hours\' worth, in fact. That means I must have played Lyrielle for longer than nearly every game on my <i>Steam </i>account - and I still can\'t tell you a damn thing about her!</p><p>I can\'t even remember why she\'s called Lyrielle. Most of my characters are named for some other character in some book I read and this certainly sounds like one of those names but it\'s not ringing any bells at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With <i>Woolhat</i>, on the other hand, I know exactly where the name comes from. He\'s an Iksar Monk and he used to be called <i>Nesmith</i>. Then there was some server merge or other and he ended up with an X on the end of his name so I renamed him Woolhat.&nbsp;</p><p>I imagine most people reading this (People read this stuff?!) don\'t need any further explanation but for the few that may, <i>Mike Nesmith</i> was one of<i> the Monkees</i> and I thought it was clever to name a Monk after a Monkee. I bet no-one else ever thought of that! And his nickname in the TV show was Woolhat. Because he always wore a wool hat. So the renaming was even cleverer!&nbsp;</p><p>(The Monkees were a pop group. They had a TV show in the sixties. Ask your grandparents.)</p><p>Nesmith/Woolhat did get played a little but for the longest time his main function has been as one of my Bazaar traders and bankers. He holds and sells a lot of stuff for other characters. These days, hold it is all he does because I haven\'t set him to trade for years. But he\'s happy enough.</p><p><i>Gladwaller</i>, it will surprise no-one to know, has been boosted. I didn\'t level him to 85. He was played, though, for a while, before that happened. He\'s a Gnome Enchanter and I made him when I fancied playing the class and didn\'t have one to hand. I messed around with him for a bit and got him into the teens or twenties then dropped him, I think because we moved servers.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no clue why I boosted him years later. The idea of jumping in at Level 85 and trying to play an Enchanter, either solo or in a group, is just fatuous. Maybe I wanted a buff-bot. I\'m pretty sure he\'s never left <i>Plane of Knowledge </i>since he drank the potion.</p><p>His name would appear to be <a href="https://salinger.org/characters/gladwaller/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">taken </span></a>from <i>J.D. Salinger</i>, which would make him my most literary of steals. As a massive Salinger fan, I may well have chosen it deliberately because of that, although I don\'t recall doing it. More likely I just had the name in mind from reading some Salinger around the same time.</p><p><i>Cofferstone</i>\'s name probably comes from <i>Frances Hardinge</i>\'s&nbsp; <i>Fly By Night</i> or<i> Twilight Robbery</i>, two excellent novels from which I\'ve borrowed several names for characters in various games. If he seems to have a lot of played hours for a Level 2, that\'s because he\'s my other Bazaar trader. I have one on each of the two accounts I (used to) play regularly. Cofferstone got a lot of use when I was leveling <i>Magmia</i> by doing Overseer missions every day. You can make very good money like that. And I did, for a few months, until all the swapping between accounts to hand the stuff across got on my nerves.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/s1456/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="314" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/w640-h314/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" width="640" /></a></div>And finally we come to <i>Telza</i>, about whom there really is nothing to say.

The event, which used to be known as\n  <i>Days of Summer</i>, when it started a litle earlier in the year, is a\n  series of weekly quests in <i>EverQuest II</i> that, at least on the face of\n  it, offers a huge boost in power for casual players at the cost of very little\n  effort indeed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At least, that\'s how it appears until you take a closer look at the way it\n  works. I had the opportunity to do just that yesterday, when I went to pick up\n  the first of this year\'s quests and found I hadn\'t finished last year\'s yet.\n  Or started them, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Technically, I <i>had </i>started the 2024 set of nine quests, but only in\n  that I\'d visited <i>Bao Bao</i>, the current Panda-in-Residence, and taken the\n  first one. It was in my Journal but I hadn\'t actually done anything about it\n  in twelve months. Bao Bao was not interested in giving me this year\'s quests\n  until I finished the job I was already on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I had thought you could skip the ones you hadn\'t done. You\'d probably want to\n  if you were a new or returning player because the event has been running since\n  2017, meaning there are now seventy-two quests in the full sequence, not\n  counting the new ones this year. There are a lot of rewards from previous\n  years that still have some currency, not least the huge number of house items,\n  but the main thrust of the event has always been to gear up and who wants a\n  load of outdated armor with inferior stats?\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/The_%22Travels%22_of_Yun_Zi_Timeline">The wiki</a>\n  is somewhat confusing on whether you can skip the years you don\'t want to do:\n  "<i>Each of the quests must be completed in the order they were released,\n    starting with the quests from 2017. You cannot skip ahead to later points in\n    the quest series. </i><b><i>*2023 can be completed without previous progress in this questline.</i>"</b>&nbsp;(Emphasis theirs.) Why 2023 is different from the rest I couldn\'t tell\n  you but it doesn\'t seem to have been the start of a new, more relaxed ruleset\n  because this year\'s starter quest looked to be firmly gated behind completion\n  of last year\'s.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/s1916/eq2lfey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/w640-h302/eq2lfey1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I imagine the reason I thought you could skip was because in 2023 you really\n  could. Maybe I did. I haven\'t checked. I vaguely remember deciding last year\n  that, since I wasn\'t going to use any of the gear, I wouldn\'t bother doing the\n  quests. Or maybe that\'s post hoc rationalization. It\'s entirely possible I\n  just forgot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There were nine quests in the 2024 set. There are nine every year. It takes us\n  through the autumn to the arrival of the annual expansion, one quest dropping\n  every week after the regular update, usually, on a Tuesday. It\'s a pleasant\n  weekly ritual to get the new one, fly around for a few minutes ticking the\n  necessary boxes, then come back to see what new stuff you can grab off the\n  store-panda.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you let yourself fall behind, however, it all feels a bit less amusing.\n  Last night and this morning I did all nine quests. I did it the fastest way\n  possible, using my All Access Membership for instant travel to and from the\n  various zones, moving between the various locations within those zones on my\n  very fast, max-level flying mount and using the detailed walkthrough, complete\n  with copy-and-paste waypoints, from the Wiki.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since I was on my Level 130 Berserker, all mobs in every required zone were\n  grey to me and non-aggressive. All I had to do was port, fly, gather and\n  return. It still took me two hours to finish all nine quests.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The quests themselves were exactly as they always are: gather some samples\n  from various parts of <i>Norrath </i>so some lazy/greedy/cowardly panda can\n  satisfy their curiosity/stuff themselves stupid. Bao Bao is quite an endearing\n  panda as these things go and the quest dialog was amusing enough but the most\n  interesting part to me is how long the dev team can keep the whole thing\n  going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a whole gang of pandas standing around in\n  <i>Sundered Frontier </i>now. I think there are three questgivers and two\n  vendors at least. When the thing started in 2017 there was only\n  <i>Yun Zi </i>handing out the quests and he did his own storekeeping.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/s1920/eq2pandas1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/w640-h360/eq2pandas1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Thanks to the wiki, I had very little trouble finding everything. Almost all\n  of the items were there in profusion. Most of them sparkled and some were\n  oversized. A couple were none of those things but the wiki warned me about\n  that and told me where to look, with accompanying screenshots.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The only part that gave me any real trouble was the quest that asked for some\n  foliage from <i>Lesser Feydark</i>. Lesser Fey is and always has been a total\n  pain to navigate. It has no portals at all accessible via map travel. The best\n  you can do is map to either <i>Butcherblock </i>and take a griffin from the\n  cliffs above the dock or port to <i>Greater Feydark</i> or\n  <i>Steamfont </i>and fly to the zone-in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I went via Butcherblock first, only to find that the BB entrance brings you in\n  on the opposite side of the map to where you want to go. I figured it would be\n  faster to map-travel to GFey and come back in from that side than to fly\n  across the whole of LFey so I did that and it wasn\'t.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d forgotten that you land in <i>Kelethin </i>and Kelethin has its own map\n  and I got myself lost coming out of the dumb elf tree city and ended up\n  wandering about for ages before I finally worked out where I was supposed to\n  be going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once in LFey it wasn\'t much better because the whole place is constructed from\n  a bunch of separate valleys with invisible walls preventing you from flying\n  between them. You have to follow rivers and go through tunnels and you can\'t\n  fly through most of the connections so you have to go on foot. The whole place\n  is a confusing, annoying mess and flying really doesn\'t make it any easier.\n</p>\n<p>So <i>that </i>was fun. I got it done eventually, anyway.</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that out of the way, I was finally able to get the first of this\n  year\'s quests, for which we will be collecting rocks, just for a change. It\n  turns out Bao Bao, who demonstrated his lack of self-control when it comes to\n  stuffing things in his mouth all through the 2024 questline, ate his way\n  through his grandmother\'s entire vegetable garden and now he needs to give her\n  some pretty rocks for her collection to get back on her good side.\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/s911/eq2pandagran2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/w640-h328/eq2pandagran2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\n  Guess who\'ll be doing the hard work lugging those rocks about. Muggins, that\'s\n  who.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And that brings me to the question, once again, of whether it will be worth\n  it. I looked at the first set of rewards, which include a bunch of purple\n  Augments, some weapons and the inevitable bags of decorating items and...\n  that\'s it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Usually there are full sets of armor for all weights and dozens of Augments,\n  along with a few other odds and ends, utilities and so on. I\'m not sure if\n  that means none of those things are going to be on the vendor this time or\n  whether they\'ll only appear week-by-week. And if they aren\'t going to be\n  there, does that mean there\'s going to be a substantial change to the way gear\n  works in the new expansion?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or does it just mean someone has finally admitted that handing out three full\n  sets of gear in three months, each of which upgrades the one before, is taking\n  generosity beyond the bounds of reason? If so, you can bet there will be howls\n  of complaint.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not that the dagger I took <i>does </i>upgrade the best one already available\n  to me, anyway. I took it because it\'s an upgrade for the weapon I was using\n  but I wasn\'t using the best weapon I own. I haven\'t claimed the weapon from\n  the Anniversary crate yet. The panda dagger won\'t upgrade that and if there is\n  panda armor this year and it has the same Resolve as the weapons, that won\'t\n  upgrade the anniversary gear, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, it will be much worse. The Anniversary stuff is 525 Resolve. The new\n  panda weapons are 505.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/s913/eq2pandagran1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/w640-h328/eq2pandagran1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nEven if we discount the Anniversary gear, which you only get for one character\non the account, Resolve 505 isn\'t going to cut it for long. As a casual soloist\nI already have lots of 495 pieces so it\'s a minimal upgrade and it will be\ninstantly rendered redundant the day the expansion arrives. I don\'t know what\nthe <i>Tishan</i>\'s gear will come in at but you can bet it will be at minimum\n505 and come with Augments that work in the new zones, which none of the old\nones will.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Some of that is speculation. This is, or should be, a level cap increase year.\n  Those are usually when things change the most so anything could happen when\n  the expansion arrives. As must be plain from everything I ever write about\n  EQII, the game is ferociously over-complicated, especially when it comes to\n  gear and stats. The team have been trying to strip away some of the accrued\n  cruft for a while now but every time they remove anything there\'s an outcry,\n  not least from the crew that claims to play EQII specifically\n  <i>because </i>it\'s complicated and difficult to understand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ll be doing the panda quests anyway. They\'re a fun little diversion and\n  don\'t take too long (Lesser Feydark always excepted.) and they unlock the\n  vendors for the whole account so it\'s a useful option for some of my\n  sub-max-level characters. Most of all, though, I don\'t want to fall behind\n  again.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Who knows, next year the pandas might come up with something different. If\n  they do, it\'d be nice to be able to grab it right away instead of playing\n  catch-up first.\n</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6VjUXTrxwVUVem4fP0CEGklW0ZKxvm_t77N3cqKlewPWTfDONQHEqczqtUHkKf8tAMeSqhMJlyL6g8qSIcnrF95DLHvGe4opHCZFBXvkSk-YXgPzpbigLUF7XC5Q-5Ku8k_xBfwuEkRbOGuWuEhn2Aa95jhOcc_gAbAtxGQzq9nEj_lP_6nfZBx5Y7BM/s1920/eq2ppp1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6VjUXTrxwVUVem4fP0CEGklW0ZKxvm_t77N3cqKlewPWTfDONQHEqczqtUHkKf8tAMeSqhMJlyL6g8qSIcnrF95DLHvGe4opHCZFBXvkSk-YXgPzpbigLUF7XC5Q-5Ku8k_xBfwuEkRbOGuWuEhn2Aa95jhOcc_gAbAtxGQzq9nEj_lP_6nfZBx5Y7BM/w640-h360/eq2ppp1.jpg" width="640" /></a>A couple of days ago, I <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/out-of-fog-they-came.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">mentioned </span></a>in passing that\n  <i>Panda Panda Panda</i> was back. The event, which used to be known as\n  <i>Days of Summer</i>, when it started a litle earlier in the year, is a\n  series of weekly quests in <i>EverQuest II</i> that, at least on the face of\n  it, offers a huge boost in power for casual players at the cost of very little\n  effort indeed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At least, that\'s how it appears until you take a closer look at the way it\n  works. I had the opportunity to do just that yesterday, when I went to pick up\n  the first of this year\'s quests and found I hadn\'t finished last year\'s yet.\n  Or started them, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Technically, I <i>had </i>started the 2024 set of nine quests, but only in\n  that I\'d visited <i>Bao Bao</i>, the current Panda-in-Residence, and taken the\n  first one. It was in my Journal but I hadn\'t actually done anything about it\n  in twelve months. Bao Bao was not interested in giving me this year\'s quests\n  until I finished the job I was already on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I had thought you could skip the ones you hadn\'t done. You\'d probably want to\n  if you were a new or returning player because the event has been running since\n  2017, meaning there are now seventy-two quests in the full sequence, not\n  counting the new ones this year. There are a lot of rewards from previous\n  years that still have some currency, not least the huge number of house items,\n  but the main thrust of the event has always been to gear up and who wants a\n  load of outdated armor with inferior stats?\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/The_%22Travels%22_of_Yun_Zi_Timeline">The wiki</a>\n  is somewhat confusing on whether you can skip the years you don\'t want to do:\n  "<i>Each of the quests must be completed in the order they were released,\n    starting with the quests from 2017. You cannot skip ahead to later points in\n    the quest series. </i><b><i>*2023 can be completed without previous progress in this questline.</i>"</b>&nbsp;(Emphasis theirs.) Why 2023 is different from the rest I couldn\'t tell\n  you but it doesn\'t seem to have been the start of a new, more relaxed ruleset\n  because this year\'s starter quest looked to be firmly gated behind completion\n  of last year\'s.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/s1916/eq2lfey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/w640-h302/eq2lfey1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I imagine the reason I thought you could skip was because in 2023 you really\n  could.

This is, or should be, a level cap increase year.\n  Those are usually when things change the most so anything could happen when\n  the expansion arrives. As must be plain from everything I ever write about\n  EQII, the game is ferociously over-complicated, especially when it comes to\n  gear and stats. The team have been trying to strip away some of the accrued\n  cruft for a while now but every time they remove anything there\'s an outcry,\n  not least from the crew that claims to play EQII specifically\n  <i>because </i>it\'s complicated and difficult to understand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ll be doing the panda quests anyway. They\'re a fun little diversion and\n  don\'t take too long (Lesser Feydark always excepted.) and they unlock the\n  vendors for the whole account so it\'s a useful option for some of my\n  sub-max-level characters. Most of all, though, I don\'t want to fall behind\n  again.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Who knows, next year the pandas might come up with something different.

It\'s all a little sporadic and random\n  and I haven\'t been doing a lot of trawling for tunes on my own, mostly relying\n  on news feeds to pop me hints, but I have collected a few good picks for the\n  post I\'m about to write. Am writing. Have written, as I do the final edit.</p>\n<p>\n  Where to start? Something fast and loud is usually indicated to get the party started.

But then everything is, now. It\'s a\n  blessing and a curse.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s the deadpan that sells it, I think. All their songs have it and it just\n  levels the whole thing up. Apparently irony hasn\'t entirely gone out of fashion after all.&nbsp;</p><p>They remind me of a band I really hoped would go\n  somewhere but didn\'t,\n  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8shM_70XWY"><span style="color: #04ff00;">Ice Cold Slush</span></a></i>, although now I watch the Slushies again, maybe not so much.

The truly\n  excellent <i>Two Ribbons</i> came out in April 2022 and there\'s been pretty\n  much nothing since. Well, they did the soundtrack to that TV show I liked, the\n  one that changed its name half-way through,\n  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRiFYtZ6iJo"><span style="color: #04ff00;">The Bastard Sone and The Devil Himself</span></a></i>, aka <i>Half Bad</i>, which was the title of the source material, an\n  excellent YA trilogy by <i>Sally Green</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>LEG </i>(Never noticed how that acronyms until now.) have not, I\'m very\n  happy to say, broken up.

They\'re childhood best friends who became critical darlings while they\n  were still extremely young (Late teens.) and then suffered some personal\n  tragedies and had a big falling out, the reconciliation from which led to the\n  last album.

And when I say\n  "triggered" I don\'t mean, as I immediately realized would be the natural\n  interpretation, "<i>triggered to want a cigarette again</i>", something that\n  never, ever happens, but "<i>triggered</i>" as in "<i>immediately pay attention to</i>"?\n</p>\n<p>\n  I might very well have clicked through this when I happened upon it, even if it\n  had been called something else, because "<i>april june</i>", no capitalization,\n  is a an attention-getter. But it was the word "<i>cigarette</i>" that did\n  it. Also the phrase, "<i>bum a cigarette</i>", which I used to hear a lot but haven\'t\n  for a while.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ve commented on this before but given\n  <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8223508/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the precipitous drop-off in tobacco smoki</span><span style="color: #ff00fe;">ng</span></a>, (Down to an historic low of just under 12% of the adult population in the\n  UK, as of\n  <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2023">2023</a>.) it seems odd that so many songs and music videos feature people lighting\n  up, drawing in, blowing out and rolling up. It is true that the age\n  demographic with the highest incidence of smoking is the 25-34 range, which is\n  bang on for the artists making the music and acting in the videos I tend to\n  feature here, but even there it\'s not even 15% that smoke. You\'d think it\n  would be off-putting to the rest of the target audience, especially with the youngest\n  group, 18-24 year-olds, showing the fastest-falling tobacco use of all.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And it\'s almost always actual cigarettes, too. Hardly ever vaping, which has\n  an even smaller take-up, just in case you were thinking that\'s what all the kids do nowadays. I guess it\'s just that smoking <i>does</i> still make you\n  look cool, just like your parents always said it wouldn\'t. Even now\n  hardly anyone\'s really doing it. Or possibly because.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>&nbsp;<i>Temptation Inside Of Your Heart&nbsp;</i></b></span>\n</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Thurston Moore </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>(Velvet Underground cover)</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Let\'s switch tracks. I\'ve been reading a lot of interviews <i>Lou Reed </i>did\n  with various music journalists over about forty years recently and also\n  reviews of all his albums, so he\'s fresh in my mind again. First time that\'s\n  happened for a while.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lou was my first, great musical crush. I got into the\n  <i>Velvet Underground</i> at a fairly early age, just a few months before\n  Lou\'s solo career finally took off with <i>Walk on the Wild Side</i> in 1972.\n  I bought every one of his solo albums on release, from\n  <i>Transformer </i>through to <i>New Sensations,</i> twelve years later. I\n  dropped off the Lou train after that but I\'ve picked over the stuff I missed\n  and filled out some gaps since then, so I feel I\'m pretty much up to speed on\n  his long career.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This particular number never got a studio release while the\n  <i>Velvets </i>were around but it turned up on the excellent\n  <i><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VU_(album)">VU</a></span> </i>compilation, where it was one of the stand-outs. This, in my opinion, is not\n  a great cover. It starts out well but wanders off half-way through.<i>\n    Sonic Youth</i>\n  have always been one of those bands I feel I ought to like more than I\n  actually do and this kind of demonstrates why. Still, nice to be reminded of\n  the song again, although I suggest going and listening to\n  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-GCBPDBDVI"><span style="color: #04ff00;">the original</span></a>.\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b><i>Lou Reed Was My Babysitter </i>- Jeff Tweedy</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Jeff Tweedy</i> and his band <i>Wilco </i>I also&nbsp;feel I should like\n  more than I do. I didn\'t much like this, the first time I heard it, but\n  it\'s a bit of a grower. He\'s clearly doing Lou although he sounds more like\n  <i>Jonathan Richman</i> at times. But Jonathan was doing Lou, too, for a long time anyway, so it\'s much the\n  same thing.\n</p>\n<p>I strongly empathize with the sentiment behind the song, which in\n  Jeff\'s words is that "<i>I was babysat by fucking Lou Reed, literally, in my bedroom as a\n    10-year-old, 12-year-old kid. His music was a more legitimate mentor to me\n    than most of my teachers.</i>" That was me, too, although I can\'t match jeff\'s impressive 10-12 age profile. I\'d have to\n  add a couple of years on the front end of that.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<b><span style="font-size: x-large;"></span></b>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>&nbsp;Aston Martin</i> - Liv de Toma</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Enough with the rock.

This is one. It\'s\n  there in the rhythms and the phrasing and the intonation. Maybe I\'m making indie rock/shoegaze, too, although I\'m not about to appropriate the qualifying tag.\n  Then again, the characters in the songs, <i>they </i>would. Some of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  My late-blooming songwriting is very, very different from the stuff I was\n  doing back in the eighties. Better, I think, but then I would, or I wouldn\'t\n  keep doing it. What I\'m less sure about is whether that\'s a direct consequence\n  of my method, re-purposing prose, or if it\'s that I\'ve developed a different ear, listening to a lot of contemporary\n  artists. If I was one of those old guys who only ever listens to stuff they\n  liked when they were young, would everything I\'m doing now sound like it did\n  when I was doing it forty years ago?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I guess I don\'t need to care.

I guess that\'s what\n  married life does for you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When I can tear myself away from the mirror, I have at least been keeping up\n  with some new music, here and there. It\'s all a little sporadic and random\n  and I haven\'t been doing a lot of trawling for tunes on my own, mostly relying\n  on news feeds to pop me hints, but I have collected a few good picks for the\n  post I\'m about to write. Am writing. Have written, as I do the final edit.</p>\n<p>\n  Where to start? Something fast and loud is usually indicated to get the party started. Let\'s see...\n</p>\n<p>Ah, yes, this will do nicely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;<i>POSH</i> - The Pill</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  I mean, where do you begin?

But then everything is, now. It\'s a\n  blessing and a curse.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s the deadpan that sells it, I think. All their songs have it and it just\n  levels the whole thing up. Apparently irony hasn\'t entirely gone out of fashion after all.&nbsp;</p><p>They remind me of a band I really hoped would go\n  somewhere but didn\'t,\n  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8shM_70XWY"><span style="color: #04ff00;">Ice Cold Slush</span></a></i>, although now I watch the Slushies again, maybe not so much. Perhaps I\'m thinking of someone else. There are a lot\n  of female duos.

Ooh! Thematic segue! This is <i>Jenny Hollingworth</i>, one half of\n  <i>Let\'s Eat Grandma</i>, probably the best female duo of the last several\n  years (I\'m including <i>Wet Leg</i>&nbsp;in that, although really I think\n  they should be considered a full, five-piece band, even though they never are.)&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lets Eat Grandma is another favorite of mine now well overdue for a new album. The truly\n  excellent <i>Two Ribbons</i> came out in April 2022 and there\'s been pretty\n  much nothing since. Well, they did the soundtrack to that TV show I liked, the\n  one that changed its name half-way through,\n  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRiFYtZ6iJo"><span style="color: #04ff00;">The Bastard Sone and The Devil Himself</span></a></i>, aka <i>Half Bad</i>, which was the title of the source material, an\n  excellent YA trilogy by <i>Sally Green</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>LEG </i>(Never noticed how that acronyms until now.) have not, I\'m very\n  happy to say, broken up. They\'re just doing that annoying thing all groups do\n  at some point, namely putting the band on hold while they "<i>pursue solo projects</i>". They\'re childhood best friends who became critical darlings while they\n  were still extremely young (Late teens.) and then suffered some personal\n  tragedies and had a big falling out, the reconciliation from which led to the\n  last album. Hardly surprising they both want some time out from each other.\n  It\'s just good to hear from them again.

And when I say\n  "triggered" I don\'t mean, as I immediately realized would be the natural\n  interpretation, "<i>triggered to want a cigarette again</i>", something that\n  never, ever happens, but "<i>triggered</i>" as in "<i>immediately pay attention to</i>"?\n</p>\n<p>\n  I might very well have clicked through this when I happened upon it, even if it\n  had been called something else, because "<i>april june</i>", no capitalization,\n  is a an attention-getter. But it was the word "<i>cigarette</i>" that did\n  it. Also the phrase, "<i>bum a cigarette</i>", which I used to hear a lot but haven\'t\n  for a while.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ve commented on this before but given\n  <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8223508/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the precipitous drop-off in tobacco smoki</span><span style="color: #ff00fe;">ng</span></a>, (Down to an historic low of just under 12% of the adult population in the\n  UK, as of\n  <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2023">2023</a>.) it seems odd that so many songs and music videos feature people lighting\n  up, drawing in, blowing out and rolling up. It is true that the age\n  demographic with the highest incidence of smoking is the 25-34 range, which is\n  bang on for the artists making the music and acting in the videos I tend to\n  feature here, but even there it\'s not even 15% that smoke. You\'d think it\n  would be off-putting to the rest of the target audience, especially with the youngest\n  group, 18-24 year-olds, showing the fastest-falling tobacco use of all.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And it\'s almost always actual cigarettes, too. Hardly ever vaping, which has\n  an even smaller take-up, just in case you were thinking that\'s what all the kids do nowadays. I guess it\'s just that smoking <i>does</i> still make you\n  look cool, just like your parents always said it wouldn\'t. Even now\n  hardly anyone\'s really doing it. Or possibly because.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>&nbsp;<i>Temptation Inside Of Your Heart&nbsp;</i></b></span>\n</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Thurston Moore </b></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>(Velvet Underground cover)</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Let\'s switch tracks. I\'ve been reading a lot of interviews <i>Lou Reed </i>did\n  with various music journalists over about forty years recently and also\n  reviews of all his albums, so he\'s fresh in my mind again. First time that\'s\n  happened for a while.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lou was my first, great musical crush. I got into the\n  <i>Velvet Underground</i> at a fairly early age, just a few months before\n  Lou\'s solo career finally took off with <i>Walk on the Wild Side</i> in 1972.\n  I bought every one of his solo albums on release, from\n  <i>Transformer </i>through to <i>New Sensations,</i> twelve years later. I\n  dropped off the Lou train after that but I\'ve picked over the stuff I missed\n  and filled out some gaps since then, so I feel I\'m pretty much up to speed on\n  his long career.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This particular number never got a studio release while the\n  <i>Velvets </i>were around but it turned up on the excellent\n  <i><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VU_(album)">VU</a></span> </i>compilation, where it was one of the stand-outs. This, in my opinion, is not\n  a great cover. It starts out well but wanders off half-way through.<i>\n    Sonic Youth</i>\n  have always been one of those bands I feel I ought to like more than I\n  actually do and this kind of demonstrates why. Still, nice to be reminded of\n  the song again, although I suggest going and listening to\n  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-GCBPDBDVI"><span style="color: #04ff00;">the original</span></a>.\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b><i>Lou Reed Was My Babysitter </i>- Jeff Tweedy</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Jeff Tweedy</i> and his band <i>Wilco </i>I also&nbsp;feel I should like\n  more than I do. I didn\'t much like this, the first time I heard it, but\n  it\'s a bit of a grower. He\'s clearly doing Lou although he sounds more like\n  <i>Jonathan Richman</i> at times. But Jonathan was doing Lou, too, for a long time anyway, so it\'s much the\n  same thing.\n</p>\n<p>I strongly empathize with the sentiment behind the song, which in\n  Jeff\'s words is that "<i>I was babysat by fucking Lou Reed, literally, in my bedroom as a\n    10-year-old, 12-year-old kid. His music was a more legitimate mentor to me\n    than most of my teachers.</i>" That was me, too, although I can\'t match jeff\'s impressive 10-12 age profile. I\'d have to\n  add a couple of years on the front end of that.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<b><span style="font-size: x-large;"></span></b>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>&nbsp;Aston Martin</i> - Liv de Toma</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Enough with the rock.

This is one. It\'s\n  there in the rhythms and the phrasing and the intonation. Maybe I\'m making indie rock/shoegaze, too, although I\'m not about to appropriate the qualifying tag.\n  Then again, the characters in the songs, <i>they </i>would. Some of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  My late-blooming songwriting is very, very different from the stuff I was\n  doing back in the eighties. Better, I think, but then I would, or I wouldn\'t\n  keep doing it. What I\'m less sure about is whether that\'s a direct consequence\n  of my method, re-purposing prose, or if it\'s that I\'ve developed a different ear, listening to a lot of contemporary\n  artists. If I was one of those old guys who only ever listens to stuff they\n  liked when they were young, would everything I\'m doing now sound like it did\n  when I was doing it forty years ago?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I guess I don\'t need to care.

I\'ve mentioned the plethora of holiday events many times. Since all of them tend to get one or two additions every year, the dense crust of content surrounding each gets thicker all the time. But the holidays are just one of the numerous content streams that keep bubbling up, over and over again.</p><p><i>Panda Panda Panda</i>, for example. <a href="https://forums.everquest2.com/index.php?threads/panda-panda-panda-is-back.10134/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">That\'s back</span></a>. It\'s not exactly a holiday, in that there\'s no specific event being celebrated. It\'s just some agarophobic pandas with a warehouse of extremely powerful items they keep trying to give away for information they could very easily google. Assuming <i>Norrath </i>has the internet, of course.</p><p>I\'m not going to say any more about Panda Panda Panda today because although I read that the event had started, I haven\'t been to see what the reclusive bears want this time. I\'ll get a separate post out of that soon enough, I\'m sure.</p><p>I\'m also not going to talk about the new(ish) Fabled dungeon that only arrived in the game a short time ago, with the summer update. It does have a solo mode I could try out but until yesterday I <strike>hadn\'t bothered to find out </strike>didn\'t know where the zone-in was. I do now but it\'s going to have to wait until I\'m both in the mood and have the time for a proper session.</p><p>No, today I\'m going to reveal a very few facts about this year\'s expansion prequel event, <i>Heralds of Oblivion</i>. Every year we get one of these, whether we want it or not. Sometimes they can be really good. I can remember a couple that kept me occupied for weeks, putting several characters through them for the experience or the loot.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixOS4UO3YKFYyCxIwAfU3aO2Ynl5hZNVfpNk9-QLq5AZCgaovcDTfK_pIqTJ_3nfYHwzqRt9Uyre1zO8VGElctDEai7tt02_Eb9_79ocseW0jLKqM0DI1htSXrxpXa9YT_qrTQvj0lE9kUAVAfumheU2VZO3jzLw3iDEGN1VV9CYmVjA8Xwgpo8LS9gS0/s1920/eq2rift5.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixOS4UO3YKFYyCxIwAfU3aO2Ynl5hZNVfpNk9-QLq5AZCgaovcDTfK_pIqTJ_3nfYHwzqRt9Uyre1zO8VGElctDEai7tt02_Eb9_79ocseW0jLKqM0DI1htSXrxpXa9YT_qrTQvj0lE9kUAVAfumheU2VZO3jzLw3iDEGN1VV9CYmVjA8Xwgpo8LS9gS0/w640-h360/eq2rift5.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Mostly though, and especially recently, they\'ve been a bit thin. Usually a very quick quest to introduce us to the next, previously unheard-of, Norrathian secret society and a bunch of repeatable quests so we can ingratiate ourselves with them for no very obvious reason. There seem to be an unlimited number of these groups, most of them self-appointed guardians of something or other, roaming around the world like a bunch of Boy Scouts looking for old ladies to help across the street or planar incursions to repel.</p><p>This yeare\'s bunch are called <i>The Flamebearers</i> and they differ from the usual run of do-gooders by being associated with <i>Lady Najena</i>, who I could have sworn was a Medium-Sized Bad last time I met her. She\'s organizing this year\'s bunfight all the same so maybe it\'s one of those enemy-of-my-enemy things or perhaps she\'s had a bang on the head.

If it had been a weekend, I guess you could have called it a weekend break. Not sure there\'s a name for two nights away when those nights are Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>We had a great time, anyway. The weather forecast was very poor but the actual weather turned out much better. We had a couple of showers but things mostly stayed dry and the sun was out for a good while both days and today as we came slowly back. We did get a downpour in the middle of the night and the bus leaked a bit, here and there, but only in places where it didn\'t matter.</p><p>The bus in question is a double-decker that\'s been converted into a two-bedroom apartment, with the bedrooms and a large lounge upstairs and a kitchen, dining room and sitting room downstairs.

I was curious so I went to have a look at what he\'s got to offer. He was very easy to find. He\'s in <i>Qeynos </i>and <i>Freeport </i>(Because in Norrath it\'s standard practice to be two places at once if you\'re an NPC.). I never have a clue where any new NPC is likely to set up their stall in Qeynos but in Freeport it\'s always down by the docks or in the charmingly-named <i>Execution Plaza</i> (Political prisoners executed every hour, on the hour, since 2004.)</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgt5l9ZG6VMJLLhn64PfqH5hGDdAPyIaJGNtZ6e8r5cfGrkywZBcDTrVSZeDNSUoymt6-HqjANUrHx6SZIebWpJUwWOmZ2AcWZJzpqVU2jZEdbVtqvUGlYBgUWeBehENws4CLDJ5sjr2Ogi_gqS1z4AON9y5MQ2MxivDRZKUomoggWXtaXCuMzAPAc9b2I/s730/eq2fablewolf1.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgt5l9ZG6VMJLLhn64PfqH5hGDdAPyIaJGNtZ6e8r5cfGrkywZBcDTrVSZeDNSUoymt6-HqjANUrHx6SZIebWpJUwWOmZ2AcWZJzpqVU2jZEdbVtqvUGlYBgUWeBehENws4CLDJ5sjr2Ogi_gqS1z4AON9y5MQ2MxivDRZKUomoggWXtaXCuMzAPAc9b2I/w270-h400/eq2fablewolf1.jpg" width="270" /></a></div>Better yet, you can ask a guard and get directions. They used to just swivel on their heels and point but now they still do that but also send a glowing trail right to the person you\'re looking for. I tried it just now and Ogor was literally about&nbsp; fifty feet from where I was standing, so that was embarassing.<p></p><p>As you can see, he is not doling out raid gear for a token or two. He hasn\'t got any useable gear at all. Someone more cynical than me might say he hasn\'t got anything <i>useful </i>at all.<br /></p><p>He\'s got a lot of house items, which is always nice but nothing so special you could imagine anyone wanting to unscramble a whole bunch of anagrams, then type the results into a chatbox in the hope of winning a lottery to get enough tokens to buy two of them. And remember, this is "<i>a bit harder of an event</i>", which is why you get two. Mostly, I can only assume, you\'ll be getting just one. If you\'re lucky.</p><p>Other than that, Ogor has a couple of quite nice petamorph wands, some decent appearance-slot robes, a couple of illusion items, some fireworks, two vanity pets and a peculiar-looking ground mount in the shape of a wolf wearing a saddle and bridle. The wolf looks like there\'s moss growing on it, too.</p><p>This is all the same sort of stuff that routinely gets given away in holiday events, of which, as I\'ve noted before, Norrath has a plethora. It appeals to a very specific demographic that seems to make up a significant proportion of forum posters and quite possibly of the playerbase as a whole. I can\'t remember exactly when it happend but at some point in its twenty-year history, EQII became a game suited mostly for absolutely obsessive min-maxers at one end and completist collectionists of fluff at the other, with not an awful lot of room for anyone inbetweeen.</p><p>The latter are going to see some merit in the new Community Token System, I\'m sure, although collectors and decorators tend to be picky. The endgame statisticians are presumably going to ignore it entirely. Whether there\'s much cross-over between the two factions I wouldn\'t care to speculate.</p><p>I don\'t think I\'d go out of my way to earn tokens for any of Ogor\'s stock. If I happen to acquire any, though, I won\'t complain. I\'d quite like those petamorph wands.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKPzcHM_vHDf97UcKdD3iymnfDbD58ObpoCbXHPjdJSphsWDf8pJK-XhS_FSzAJTBfXhmXDfLiSKuqlc1Dnzftw8RFsKP8SZFMY6BsKKqXnNqQ_WW9foDRR5fv_n3A0bqM-Fg_rfyV8p2YsNgL214CA7LebhjHjwSZh8p4izRGwFQW-08ppzErrL8JLrw/s832/eq2fable2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="251" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKPzcHM_vHDf97UcKdD3iymnfDbD58ObpoCbXHPjdJSphsWDf8pJK-XhS_FSzAJTBfXhmXDfLiSKuqlc1Dnzftw8RFsKP8SZFMY6BsKKqXnNqQ_WW9foDRR5fv_n3A0bqM-Fg_rfyV8p2YsNgL214CA7LebhjHjwSZh8p4izRGwFQW-08ppzErrL8JLrw/w400-h251/eq2fable2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>I suppose it\'s going to depend mostly on what the events are like. I note that as well as competitions and similar events on the forums or Discord, Guides can also hand out tokens as rewards in the game itself. I haven\'t seen a guide event for a while but it\'s nice to know they still exist and also that Guides now have a way of encouraging players to join in with ad hoc events rather than just re-running the familiar Guide Quests (Not that those aren\'t always welcome - you can get some nice bags that way.)<p></p><p>Angeliana does also say that "<i>From time to time, he will even get some items added</i>"&nbsp;so we can hope for better, later. I very much doubt he\'ll ever have anything more than cosmetics to give away, though.</p><p>And that\'s fine. When I first read the forum post announcing the new feature I did worry for a moment that it was a replacement for <i>Panda! Panda! Panda!, </i>which does give some very good gear for the minor effort of some extremely easy questing<i>.</i></p><p>The supposed lore explanation "<i>Ogor the Happy, wants terribly to be an adventurer. Alas he cannot, so \nhe needs you to get him some Norrathian Fables and bring them to him. In\n turn, he will let you choose from a plethora of items he happens to \nhave sitting around.</i>" does make his motivation sound remarkably similar to <i>Yun Zi\'</i>s. I suspect that has more to do with lack of imagination than anything else. It\'s also how <i>Qho</i>\'s super-annoying gathering questline is explained.</p><p>Also, I just proved myself a liar by remembering their&nbsp;names immediately, without having to look anything up. I guess some NPCs do familiarize themselves over time after all.</p><p>Good luck getting a funny anagram out of either of their names, though!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjrnOPtwAO0sCufyIquKC7rGKj7sppRwg4WL41U7wSViOf1qJK685c24nwkNoGnL3Ynbx2DJ_Pffjq3VUKdYEfwcEyVeO19BIYuy66oWmg-EP9NTXkQF2BKbVvSywtb5ZGdKrJc2om0hUMXtfesYCOivDScfcYH-SLYotGWYsbJ4-g3fag_5LfAAoRTDc/s1194/eq2ogor1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="254" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjrnOPtwAO0sCufyIquKC7rGKj7sppRwg4WL41U7wSViOf1qJK685c24nwkNoGnL3Ynbx2DJ_Pffjq3VUKdYEfwcEyVeO19BIYuy66oWmg-EP9NTXkQF2BKbVvSywtb5ZGdKrJc2om0hUMXtfesYCOivDScfcYH-SLYotGWYsbJ4-g3fag_5LfAAoRTDc/w640-h254/eq2ogor1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />Introducing...<p><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">The Community Token System</span></b></p><p>Wait!

And remember, this is "<i>a bit harder of an event</i>", which is why you get two. Mostly, I can only assume, you\'ll be getting just one. If you\'re lucky.</p><p>Other than that, Ogor has a couple of quite nice petamorph wands, some decent appearance-slot robes, a couple of illusion items, some fireworks, two vanity pets and a peculiar-looking ground mount in the shape of a wolf wearing a saddle and bridle. The wolf looks like there\'s moss growing on it, too.</p><p>This is all the same sort of stuff that routinely gets given away in holiday events, of which, as I\'ve noted before, Norrath has a plethora. It appeals to a very specific demographic that seems to make up a significant proportion of forum posters and quite possibly of the playerbase as a whole. I can\'t remember exactly when it happend but at some point in its twenty-year history, EQII became a game suited mostly for absolutely obsessive min-maxers at one end and completist collectionists of fluff at the other, with not an awful lot of room for anyone inbetweeen.</p><p>The latter are going to see some merit in the new Community Token System, I\'m sure, although collectors and decorators tend to be picky. The endgame statisticians are presumably going to ignore it entirely. Whether there\'s much cross-over between the two factions I wouldn\'t care to speculate.</p><p>I don\'t think I\'d go out of my way to earn tokens for any of Ogor\'s stock. If I happen to acquire any, though, I won\'t complain. I\'d quite like those petamorph wands.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKPzcHM_vHDf97UcKdD3iymnfDbD58ObpoCbXHPjdJSphsWDf8pJK-XhS_FSzAJTBfXhmXDfLiSKuqlc1Dnzftw8RFsKP8SZFMY6BsKKqXnNqQ_WW9foDRR5fv_n3A0bqM-Fg_rfyV8p2YsNgL214CA7LebhjHjwSZh8p4izRGwFQW-08ppzErrL8JLrw/s832/eq2fable2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="251" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKPzcHM_vHDf97UcKdD3iymnfDbD58ObpoCbXHPjdJSphsWDf8pJK-XhS_FSzAJTBfXhmXDfLiSKuqlc1Dnzftw8RFsKP8SZFMY6BsKKqXnNqQ_WW9foDRR5fv_n3A0bqM-Fg_rfyV8p2YsNgL214CA7LebhjHjwSZh8p4izRGwFQW-08ppzErrL8JLrw/w400-h251/eq2fable2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>I suppose it\'s going to depend mostly on what the events are like. I note that as well as competitions and similar events on the forums or Discord, Guides can also hand out tokens as rewards in the game itself. I haven\'t seen a guide event for a while but it\'s nice to know they still exist and also that Guides now have a way of encouraging players to join in with ad hoc events rather than just re-running the familiar Guide Quests (Not that those aren\'t always welcome - you can get some nice bags that way.)<p></p><p>Angeliana does also say that "<i>From time to time, he will even get some items added</i>"&nbsp;so we can hope for better, later.

When I first read the forum post announcing the new feature I did worry for a moment that it was a replacement for <i>Panda! Panda!

Alas he cannot, so \nhe needs you to get him some Norrathian Fables and bring them to him. In\n turn, he will let you choose from a plethora of items he happens to \nhave sitting around.</i>" does make his motivation sound remarkably similar to <i>Yun Zi\'</i>s. I suspect that has more to do with lack of imagination than anything else. It\'s also how <i>Qho</i>\'s super-annoying gathering questline is explained.</p><p>Also, I just proved myself a liar by remembering their&nbsp;names immediately, without having to look anything up.

After all those years of reading other people blogging about the\n  <i>Civ </i>series and 4X games in general and thinking "<i>Well, it\'s all very interesting to read about but I can\'t imagine ever\n    playing something like that</i>". A bit like <i>EVE </i>or <i>Rimworld </i>or <i>Dwarf Fortress</i>, I\n  guess. Some games are just more fun to read about than play.\n</p>\n<p>Or so I thought. And quite possibly still do. Too soon to say for sure.</p>\n<p>\n  Obviously, I wouldn\'t have tried it at all if I hadn\'t gotten it for free from\n  <i>Prime</i>. I\'m scratching around at the moment, trying to find something to\n  play that can hold my attention but which can also be stopped at a moment\'s\n  notice. I was going through the options when I noticed it and thought, well,\n  why not?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Talking of options, boy, there are a lot of them! Everyone likes to talk about\n  their <i>Steam </i>backlogs but I\'ve always said I don\'t really have that much\n  of one. Which is true, as it goes, although not as true as it used to be. My\n  <i>Amazon Prime Gaming</i> backlog though...\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have 162 games on Prime, of which I have played nineteen and finished five.\n  On <i>GOG </i>I have 60, with just three played and none finished. On\n  <i>Epic Games</i> I have another 40 titles, of which I have played exactly two\n  - and one of those is <i>Fortnite</i>. All of them, across the three\n  platforms, bar a handful, were freebies from Prime - and I probably claim less\n  than half of the games Prime gives away.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And yet somehow, even with almost 250 unplayed titles to choose from, I can\n  never seem to find anything I want to play. Worse, when I do pick something\n  and give it a go, it doesn\'t stick.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is how I came to install and open <i>CivIV </i>a couple of days ago. It\n  seemed like it might be worth a try. I mean, everyone else seems to enjoy\n  it...\n</p>\n<p>So, did I? Enjoy it, that is?</p>\n<p>Hmm. Tough question. I\'ll get back to you when I have an answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBXdE89LcrefyXCyUbF99vpb3slJvO8RkVS6uFUUTIDamNwPq7_mCeLvM55f0tyVcgr_rGMEsr4ZtRgRAijzwj_MC-rLyaYTdEFF9w8JJAWTY2XrSCY7njQGfL0CFUYh4FjwiCcraE0oHRdAEWJ0tDG9wZ-dQeCBEv0h5D-wFj1fZLcP7mP0x5lDXDIp0/s1024/civ3.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBXdE89LcrefyXCyUbF99vpb3slJvO8RkVS6uFUUTIDamNwPq7_mCeLvM55f0tyVcgr_rGMEsr4ZtRgRAijzwj_MC-rLyaYTdEFF9w8JJAWTY2XrSCY7njQGfL0CFUYh4FjwiCcraE0oHRdAEWJ0tDG9wZ-dQeCBEv0h5D-wFj1fZLcP7mP0x5lDXDIp0/w640-h480/civ3.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><br /><p></p>\n<p>\n  So far I\'ve played for a couple of hours in two sessions and it\'s been...\n  occupying. Time certainly passes. There\'s a lot to do. It keeps you busy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For my first session I jumped straight in and started playing. That wasn\'t so\n  much a choice as a mistake, by which I don\'t mean it went badly, just that I\n  didn\'t mean to do it. I assumed there\'d be an in-game tutorial. There is not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There <i>is </i>a Tutorial, of course. I just didn\'t notice it was a separate\n  option on the main menu. I\'d completely forgotten that\'s how they used to do\n  it in the old days.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Starting without any kind of lead-in or explanation was an odd experience.\n  Confusing but also fairly straightforward, by which I mean the game is somehow\n  still playable, even when you have absolutely no idea what you\'re doing or\n  indeed what you ought to be doing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s mainly because every single UI element seems to have a mouse-over\n  tool-tip and most actions seem to require not much more than a left click. I\n  just moused over everything and started clicking and something approximating a\n  game seemed to coalesce around me.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I left everything on the defaults. I built a city. I killed some bears. I\n  explored to clear the fog of war. I built another city. I kept picking from\n  lists of options and the years rolled by. I started at the dawn of\n  civilization, 4000 BC, and by the time I finished an hour later it was the\n  Renaissance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For some reason I kept founding religions, which seemed extremely weird. I was\n  playing as Spain and yet I still managed to found Buddhism, then Confucianism,\n  then Taoism. I would have thought a necessary corollary of founding\n  Confucianism, for example, would be that you\'d have to be <i>Confucius</i>, or\n  for a ruler to take the credit, they\'d at least need to count Confucius as a\n  subject. It seemed unlikely either he or Buddha would have been living in\n  Barcelona or Madrid at the time but I guess they must have gotten there from\n  China somehow...\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg90rQFY3XjlgH74vvvtWqTaXc20aybrKFw4O9xwOx6E9BJaScEwHZoslfGRHcdLzQOhmqJ5ER4-uGWyGY2xZp8RY2opptsUQfO3nBG57qz5eDnqHNP8ERvL-q0w2Zb_UvQ3ZmuCZeh-Fz-7L6Kkn0Q8WIqgWQwThOPAv8oZ5ILj0Z6XqMu6cuqRk8CD-M/s1024/civ4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg90rQFY3XjlgH74vvvtWqTaXc20aybrKFw4O9xwOx6E9BJaScEwHZoslfGRHcdLzQOhmqJ5ER4-uGWyGY2xZp8RY2opptsUQfO3nBG57qz5eDnqHNP8ERvL-q0w2Zb_UvQ3ZmuCZeh-Fz-7L6Kkn0Q8WIqgWQwThOPAv8oZ5ILj0Z6XqMu6cuqRk8CD-M/w640-h480/civ4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Other leaders kept popping up to ask me to make deals with them or break deals\n  I\'d made with other nations. I always agreed with whatever they wanted and\n  always made peace not war. I hadn\'t figured out how to get my army to fight\n  anyone except bears and lions so peace seemed like the best option.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I had trouble getting any of my units to go where I wanted anyway. I lost\n  Barcelona because someone attacked it and I couldn\'t figure out how to get a\n  Warrior unit over there in time. It didn\'t seem to matter much because by then\n  I had a third city and I was having more than enough trouble managing two of\n  them. I was quite glad to see Barcelona go.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I could tell there was some kind of score being kept in the lower right-hand\n  corner of the screen but I didn\'t really know what made the numbers change or\n  what the victory condition might be. I figured bigger numbers were probably\n  better, though, and Spain was either at the top of the list or at least in the\n  top half most of the time. There were always other civilizations doing a lot\n  worse than me so I was happy enough with how things were going.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that went on for a little over an hour before it started to get on top\n  of me a bit. I figured out how to save the game and stopped. I could see how\n  someone could get into that "<i>Just one more turn</i>" frame of mind I\'ve\n  read about, especially if they knew what they were doing. It is quite\n  compulsive, pushing the button to see what happens next.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I guess I must have enjoyed myself at least a little because yesterday I felt\n  like having another go. I thought maybe I ought to try and find out at least a\n  little about how to play so I googled around for a while and learned... there\n  <i>is </i>a Tutorial after all. I did think it was strange there wasn\'t one\n  but then I thought maybe, back in the day, the game would have come in a box\n  with a manual as thick as a novel and you were probably supposed to read that\n  before you got started.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSpmr7SN2WhO6mFcVhnVf7BL6I0fsoSPYumCAsZUlgFE06s7J4-GpF9m3ROKmGJNNZhGJq404F_k1Z54rX2XB8YV4TyXnFrFNReiD3G8021LBrPQSeAkihtvw0oQ1TfpEjUgD1y0BOql4ZzVd8tklAvqxeFgkKF9CHvwRtM7ZQvWA0ZIBhFsMhC28c2l8/s1024/civsid1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSpmr7SN2WhO6mFcVhnVf7BL6I0fsoSPYumCAsZUlgFE06s7J4-GpF9m3ROKmGJNNZhGJq404F_k1Z54rX2XB8YV4TyXnFrFNReiD3G8021LBrPQSeAkihtvw0oQ1TfpEjUgD1y0BOql4ZzVd8tklAvqxeFgkKF9CHvwRtM7ZQvWA0ZIBhFsMhC28c2l8/w640-h480/civsid1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nLast night I tried again, only this time I didn\'t load up my saved game. I\nopened the tutorial instead.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I learned a few things, not least what <i>Sid Meier </i>sounds like. At least,\n  I assume that\'s him, reading out the instructions, like a high school history\n  teacher, following a familiar lesson plan on a warm afternoon in front of a\n  drowsy classroom, just before school breaks up for summer. And the balding\n  fellow with the fixed smile, dressed like a sales assistant at a discount\n  warehouse? That must be Sid, too. The guy clearly doesn\'t have much of an ego.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The tutorial was helpful, anyway. The most important thing I learned was that\n  you have to right-click to get anyone to go where you tell them. That\n  explained a lot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There was some useful information about <i>why </i>you might want to do\n  certain things, too, not just how you\'d make them happen. As I said, for the\n  most part it\'s not too hard to figure out what things do from&nbsp; the tool\n  tips but it\'s much harder to see why you\'d want to do any of them. I mostly\n  just picked stuff I like, like art and literature and music and ignored all\n  the boring agriculture and industry. I probably should have played Greece.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What became clear from the tutorial is that the game is basically a management\n  sim. In all the thousands and thousands of words I\'d read about it, I don\'t\n  think that had ever really come across. People always blog about the\n  interesting stuff, don\'t they? Who declared war on whom or who invented what.\n  They never tell you how many tiny little repetitive actions it took before\n  anything interesting happened at all.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRg2QKnJ6C-HRljoAR0nIzHbcE9HuduOiT1hOliwJPI8uwhc-uTmTiCFdqHhEtvkA6xYT-NRIt_luyeVoeDBavj95uB-aC8khLoLK9U28L3krrB9Ho66QrPuqX_7dNUnHCoz3FSoPLgNMKdzyQHh9cJ_i4ixTHbKxw6iu2N_IbCyUmTA_ZQ6qOE7pC0oA/s304/Dictator1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRg2QKnJ6C-HRljoAR0nIzHbcE9HuduOiT1hOliwJPI8uwhc-uTmTiCFdqHhEtvkA6xYT-NRIt_luyeVoeDBavj95uB-aC8khLoLK9U28L3krrB9Ho66QrPuqX_7dNUnHCoz3FSoPLgNMKdzyQHh9cJ_i4ixTHbKxw6iu2N_IbCyUmTA_ZQ6qOE7pC0oA/w263-h400/Dictator1.png" width="263" /></a>\n</div>\nI was about to say I\'ve never liked management sims but then it occurred to me\nthat\'s not entirely true. Right at the beginning of my gaming life, I used to\nplay them quite enthusiastically. I remember one my ex-wife and I used to play a\nlot on the ZX Spectrum, a political sim where you had to manage all kinds of\nfactors to keep yourself in power. I remember we used to sit there in our bean\nbags and shout at the screen.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I think it was called\n  <i><a href="https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/31109/Dictator/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Dictator</span></a></i>. Yep! That\'s the one. I bet I still have the cassette somewhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I even wrote a management sim once. I think it might be the only game I ever\n  coded from scratch. I wrote it one afternoon at my mother\'s house on my\n  step-father\'s <i>Oric </i>computer that he\'d won in some competition and never\n  used. It had some ridiculously tiny memory measured in kilobytes and I wrote a\n  moonbase sim for it that worked, just about. I wrote it in RAM, though, so it\n  only existed for that afternoon and never again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that was back in the eighties. The early eighties. I don\'t believe I\'ve\n  played a management sim since.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, the 4X genre is a hybrid, with other gameplay beyond resource\n  management. There\'s a big map to explore and you can fight animals and people\n  but most importantly there are all those familiar names. That\'s what makes it\n  interesting.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And surreal. It\'s very peculiar to have <i>Elizabeth I</i> suddenly appear and\n  start schmoozing you, especially when <i>Julius Caesar</i> just left. It\n  reminded me a bit of that <i>Philip Jose Farmer</i> series,\n  <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverworld"><i>Riverworld</i></a></span>, where everyone who ever lived has been brought back to life at the same\n  time, in the same place. Without that, I doubt it would be half as engaging.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I stuck with the tutorial for about an hour but then it was time for Beryl\'s\n  evening walk so I had to stop. I couldn\'t see any way to save the tutorial so\n  I just logged out. If I have to go back to the beginning and do it over, I\n  don\'t think I\'ll bother. I reckon I know enough to get started now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Will I, though? Am I engaged enough with the concept for another session?\n  Possibly. It does, as I said, occupy the mind, which is welcome at the moment,\n  as I negotiate some changes in routine, with&nbsp;my 93 year-old mother\n  suddenly needing a lot more support to stay in her home than usual and her\n  living an hour\'s drive away and we only having the one car.\n</p>\n<p>\n  On the other hand, there are plenty of games that do a pretty good job of\n  occupying the mind and I can think of plenty whose gameplay would be more to\n  my taste than 4X offers.

A bit like <i>EVE </i>or <i>Rimworld </i>or <i>Dwarf Fortress</i>, I\n  guess. Some games are just more fun to read about than play.\n</p>\n<p>Or so I thought. And quite possibly still do. Too soon to say for sure.</p>\n<p>\n  Obviously, I wouldn\'t have tried it at all if I hadn\'t gotten it for free from\n  <i>Prime</i>. I\'m scratching around at the moment, trying to find something to\n  play that can hold my attention but which can also be stopped at a moment\'s\n  notice. I was going through the options when I noticed it and thought, well,\n  why not?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Talking of options, boy, there are a lot of them! Everyone likes to talk about\n  their <i>Steam </i>backlogs but I\'ve always said I don\'t really have that much\n  of one. Which is true, as it goes, although not as true as it used to be. My\n  <i>Amazon Prime Gaming</i> backlog though...\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have 162 games on Prime, of which I have played nineteen and finished five.\n  On <i>GOG </i>I have 60, with just three played and none finished. On\n  <i>Epic Games</i> I have another 40 titles, of which I have played exactly two\n  - and one of those is <i>Fortnite</i>. All of them, across the three\n  platforms, bar a handful, were freebies from Prime - and I probably claim less\n  than half of the games Prime gives away.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And yet somehow, even with almost 250 unplayed titles to choose from, I can\n  never seem to find anything I want to play. Worse, when I do pick something\n  and give it a go, it doesn\'t stick.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is how I came to install and open <i>CivIV </i>a couple of days ago. It\n  seemed like it might be worth a try. I mean, everyone else seems to enjoy\n  it...\n</p>\n<p>So, did I? Enjoy it, that is?</p>\n<p>Hmm. Tough question. I\'ll get back to you when I have an answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBXdE89LcrefyXCyUbF99vpb3slJvO8RkVS6uFUUTIDamNwPq7_mCeLvM55f0tyVcgr_rGMEsr4ZtRgRAijzwj_MC-rLyaYTdEFF9w8JJAWTY2XrSCY7njQGfL0CFUYh4FjwiCcraE0oHRdAEWJ0tDG9wZ-dQeCBEv0h5D-wFj1fZLcP7mP0x5lDXDIp0/s1024/civ3.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBXdE89LcrefyXCyUbF99vpb3slJvO8RkVS6uFUUTIDamNwPq7_mCeLvM55f0tyVcgr_rGMEsr4ZtRgRAijzwj_MC-rLyaYTdEFF9w8JJAWTY2XrSCY7njQGfL0CFUYh4FjwiCcraE0oHRdAEWJ0tDG9wZ-dQeCBEv0h5D-wFj1fZLcP7mP0x5lDXDIp0/w640-h480/civ3.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><br /><p></p>\n<p>\n  So far I\'ve played for a couple of hours in two sessions and it\'s been...\n  occupying. Time certainly passes. There\'s a lot to do. It keeps you busy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For my first session I jumped straight in and started playing. That wasn\'t so\n  much a choice as a mistake, by which I don\'t mean it went badly, just that I\n  didn\'t mean to do it. I assumed there\'d be an in-game tutorial. There is not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There <i>is </i>a Tutorial, of course. I just didn\'t notice it was a separate\n  option on the main menu. I\'d completely forgotten that\'s how they used to do\n  it in the old days.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Starting without any kind of lead-in or explanation was an odd experience.\n  Confusing but also fairly straightforward, by which I mean the game is somehow\n  still playable, even when you have absolutely no idea what you\'re doing or\n  indeed what you ought to be doing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s mainly because every single UI element seems to have a mouse-over\n  tool-tip and most actions seem to require not much more than a left click. I\n  just moused over everything and started clicking and something approximating a\n  game seemed to coalesce around me.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I left everything on the defaults. I built a city. I killed some bears. I\n  explored to clear the fog of war. I built another city. I kept picking from\n  lists of options and the years rolled by. I started at the dawn of\n  civilization, 4000 BC, and by the time I finished an hour later it was the\n  Renaissance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For some reason I kept founding religions, which seemed extremely weird. I was\n  playing as Spain and yet I still managed to found Buddhism, then Confucianism,\n  then Taoism. I would have thought a necessary corollary of founding\n  Confucianism, for example, would be that you\'d have to be <i>Confucius</i>, or\n  for a ruler to take the credit, they\'d at least need to count Confucius as a\n  subject. It seemed unlikely either he or Buddha would have been living in\n  Barcelona or Madrid at the time but I guess they must have gotten there from\n  China somehow...\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg90rQFY3XjlgH74vvvtWqTaXc20aybrKFw4O9xwOx6E9BJaScEwHZoslfGRHcdLzQOhmqJ5ER4-uGWyGY2xZp8RY2opptsUQfO3nBG57qz5eDnqHNP8ERvL-q0w2Zb_UvQ3ZmuCZeh-Fz-7L6Kkn0Q8WIqgWQwThOPAv8oZ5ILj0Z6XqMu6cuqRk8CD-M/s1024/civ4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg90rQFY3XjlgH74vvvtWqTaXc20aybrKFw4O9xwOx6E9BJaScEwHZoslfGRHcdLzQOhmqJ5ER4-uGWyGY2xZp8RY2opptsUQfO3nBG57qz5eDnqHNP8ERvL-q0w2Zb_UvQ3ZmuCZeh-Fz-7L6Kkn0Q8WIqgWQwThOPAv8oZ5ILj0Z6XqMu6cuqRk8CD-M/w640-h480/civ4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Other leaders kept popping up to ask me to make deals with them or break deals\n  I\'d made with other nations. I always agreed with whatever they wanted and\n  always made peace not war. I hadn\'t figured out how to get my army to fight\n  anyone except bears and lions so peace seemed like the best option.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I had trouble getting any of my units to go where I wanted anyway. I lost\n  Barcelona because someone attacked it and I couldn\'t figure out how to get a\n  Warrior unit over there in time. It didn\'t seem to matter much because by then\n  I had a third city and I was having more than enough trouble managing two of\n  them. I was quite glad to see Barcelona go.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I could tell there was some kind of score being kept in the lower right-hand\n  corner of the screen but I didn\'t really know what made the numbers change or\n  what the victory condition might be. I figured bigger numbers were probably\n  better, though, and Spain was either at the top of the list or at least in the\n  top half most of the time. There were always other civilizations doing a lot\n  worse than me so I was happy enough with how things were going.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that went on for a little over an hour before it started to get on top\n  of me a bit. I figured out how to save the game and stopped. I could see how\n  someone could get into that "<i>Just one more turn</i>" frame of mind I\'ve\n  read about, especially if they knew what they were doing. It is quite\n  compulsive, pushing the button to see what happens next.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I guess I must have enjoyed myself at least a little because yesterday I felt\n  like having another go. I thought maybe I ought to try and find out at least a\n  little about how to play so I googled around for a while and learned... there\n  <i>is </i>a Tutorial after all. I did think it was strange there wasn\'t one\n  but then I thought maybe, back in the day, the game would have come in a box\n  with a manual as thick as a novel and you were probably supposed to read that\n  before you got started.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSpmr7SN2WhO6mFcVhnVf7BL6I0fsoSPYumCAsZUlgFE06s7J4-GpF9m3ROKmGJNNZhGJq404F_k1Z54rX2XB8YV4TyXnFrFNReiD3G8021LBrPQSeAkihtvw0oQ1TfpEjUgD1y0BOql4ZzVd8tklAvqxeFgkKF9CHvwRtM7ZQvWA0ZIBhFsMhC28c2l8/s1024/civsid1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSpmr7SN2WhO6mFcVhnVf7BL6I0fsoSPYumCAsZUlgFE06s7J4-GpF9m3ROKmGJNNZhGJq404F_k1Z54rX2XB8YV4TyXnFrFNReiD3G8021LBrPQSeAkihtvw0oQ1TfpEjUgD1y0BOql4ZzVd8tklAvqxeFgkKF9CHvwRtM7ZQvWA0ZIBhFsMhC28c2l8/w640-h480/civsid1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nLast night I tried again, only this time I didn\'t load up my saved game. I\nopened the tutorial instead.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I learned a few things, not least what <i>Sid Meier </i>sounds like. At least,\n  I assume that\'s him, reading out the instructions, like a high school history\n  teacher, following a familiar lesson plan on a warm afternoon in front of a\n  drowsy classroom, just before school breaks up for summer. And the balding\n  fellow with the fixed smile, dressed like a sales assistant at a discount\n  warehouse? That must be Sid, too. The guy clearly doesn\'t have much of an ego.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The tutorial was helpful, anyway. The most important thing I learned was that\n  you have to right-click to get anyone to go where you tell them. That\n  explained a lot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There was some useful information about <i>why </i>you might want to do\n  certain things, too, not just how you\'d make them happen. As I said, for the\n  most part it\'s not too hard to figure out what things do from&nbsp; the tool\n  tips but it\'s much harder to see why you\'d want to do any of them. I mostly\n  just picked stuff I like, like art and literature and music and ignored all\n  the boring agriculture and industry. I probably should have played Greece.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What became clear from the tutorial is that the game is basically a management\n  sim. In all the thousands and thousands of words I\'d read about it, I don\'t\n  think that had ever really come across. People always blog about the\n  interesting stuff, don\'t they? Who declared war on whom or who invented what.\n  They never tell you how many tiny little repetitive actions it took before\n  anything interesting happened at all.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRg2QKnJ6C-HRljoAR0nIzHbcE9HuduOiT1hOliwJPI8uwhc-uTmTiCFdqHhEtvkA6xYT-NRIt_luyeVoeDBavj95uB-aC8khLoLK9U28L3krrB9Ho66QrPuqX_7dNUnHCoz3FSoPLgNMKdzyQHh9cJ_i4ixTHbKxw6iu2N_IbCyUmTA_ZQ6qOE7pC0oA/s304/Dictator1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRg2QKnJ6C-HRljoAR0nIzHbcE9HuduOiT1hOliwJPI8uwhc-uTmTiCFdqHhEtvkA6xYT-NRIt_luyeVoeDBavj95uB-aC8khLoLK9U28L3krrB9Ho66QrPuqX_7dNUnHCoz3FSoPLgNMKdzyQHh9cJ_i4ixTHbKxw6iu2N_IbCyUmTA_ZQ6qOE7pC0oA/w263-h400/Dictator1.png" width="263" /></a>\n</div>\nI was about to say I\'ve never liked management sims but then it occurred to me\nthat\'s not entirely true. Right at the beginning of my gaming life, I used to\nplay them quite enthusiastically. I remember one my ex-wife and I used to play a\nlot on the ZX Spectrum, a political sim where you had to manage all kinds of\nfactors to keep yourself in power. I remember we used to sit there in our bean\nbags and shout at the screen.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I think it was called\n  <i><a href="https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/31109/Dictator/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Dictator</span></a></i>. Yep! That\'s the one. I bet I still have the cassette somewhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I even wrote a management sim once. I think it might be the only game I ever\n  coded from scratch. I wrote it one afternoon at my mother\'s house on my\n  step-father\'s <i>Oric </i>computer that he\'d won in some competition and never\n  used. It had some ridiculously tiny memory measured in kilobytes and I wrote a\n  moonbase sim for it that worked, just about. I wrote it in RAM, though, so it\n  only existed for that afternoon and never again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that was back in the eighties. The early eighties. I don\'t believe I\'ve\n  played a management sim since.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, the 4X genre is a hybrid, with other gameplay beyond resource\n  management. There\'s a big map to explore and you can fight animals and people\n  but most importantly there are all those familiar names. That\'s what makes it\n  interesting.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And surreal. It\'s very peculiar to have <i>Elizabeth I</i> suddenly appear and\n  start schmoozing you, especially when <i>Julius Caesar</i> just left. It\n  reminded me a bit of that <i>Philip Jose Farmer</i> series,\n  <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverworld"><i>Riverworld</i></a></span>, where everyone who ever lived has been brought back to life at the same\n  time, in the same place. Without that, I doubt it would be half as engaging.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I stuck with the tutorial for about an hour but then it was time for Beryl\'s\n  evening walk so I had to stop. I couldn\'t see any way to save the tutorial so\n  I just logged out. If I have to go back to the beginning and do it over, I\n  don\'t think I\'ll bother. I reckon I know enough to get started now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Will I, though? Am I engaged enough with the concept for another session?\n  Possibly. It does, as I said, occupy the mind, which is welcome at the moment,\n  as I negotiate some changes in routine, with&nbsp;my 93 year-old mother\n  suddenly needing a lot more support to stay in her home than usual and her\n  living an hour\'s drive away and we only having the one car.\n</p>\n<p>\n  On the other hand, there are plenty of games that do a pretty good job of\n  occupying the mind and I can think of plenty whose gameplay would be more to\n  my taste than 4X offers. Just none of the ones I already own,\n  apparently.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>Maybe this is the time to buy <i>Baldur\'s Gate 3</i>.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/how-very-civilized.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/how-very-civilized.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxPHymqJHu9dFhtE8pDO8lAu4tX6qTia6L1vN0VzoUEXPvmBZZC9jZ_NXiBKvHzrAYTVXglfowbDYBY4xYAivGE0jhFXFC9WIbqYUX-EXXYIP8ghpIjPm5CQ3Un9IAboOEERxKoLQ0cWzE1__RRrYabRn8lpSMFdpmz_ueCb92oU0VGB1zFRUrrJRhZfs/s72-w640-h480-c/civ2.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '3'}

As I said in the comment thread to his post, it\'s largely replaced\nplaying video games for me, in the way playing games once replaced watching\ntelevision. I very much doubt it\'ll hold my attention for more than two decades, the way\nMMORPGs did, but for now it\'s still feeling quite compulsive.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  There\'s probably a whole series of posts I could write about various aspects of making music this\n  way - practical, philosophical, aesthetic, ethical, legal - but not right now.\n  Today I just thought I\'d share an idea I had for a parlor game, to be played\n  using your LLM of choice, an idea that only occurred to me last night as I was\n  asking mine, which happens to be <i>Gemini,&nbsp;</i>a question.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, when I\'m working with Suno, I make up my whole prompts from scratch. I do\n  re-use a lot of them, often with certain key phrases changed, trying to\n  finesse the exact result I\'m after, but I\'m not usually trying to re-create\n  the signature sound of a specific band or singer, more the sounds I hear in my\n  head.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Occasionally, though, I look at something I\'ve written and wonder what it\n  might sound like if it had been covered by someone I like. Or, for that\n  matter, don\'t like. Even more occasionally I find myself wanting to make\n  something that sounds entirely <i>unlike </i>anything I\'d come up with on my own, both for inspiration and\n  variety.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To that end, now and again, I go to Gemini and ask it to give me a prompt for\n  Suno that describes how a particular genre or band sounds. Feed those into Suno unedited and the results aren\'t often all\n  that close. You can always recognize the influences but it\'s not like you can copy and paste from one AI to another and pump out convincing ersatz albums by your favorite acts like some kind of\n  amateur\n  <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops_(record_series)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Top of the Pops</span></a>&nbsp;</i>knock-off operation. Well, not yet, anyway.\n</p>\n<p>It would be an amusing party game to generate a bunch of those, play them\n  and have people try to guess who they were supposed to be. I can imagine that being\n  a lot of fun with enough drink taken. If I thought anyone would actually take\n  the time to click through and listen, I might have knocked out a few myself and included them here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But that would be a lot of work and I\'d be surprised if more than a handful of\n  readers would be interested enough to listen to even a few bars. That sort of thing really requires a bunch of people together in a room to be fun.&nbsp;</p><p>What would be\n  much easier and also a better game for a blog would be if I just copied and\n  pasted a few of Gemini\'s prompts to see if anyone can recognize the acts from the\n  descriptions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Gemini is pretty good at describing what singers and bands sound like.\n  Disturbingly good, actually. The shorthand explanation of how "<i><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/the-surprising-power-of-next-word-prediction-large-language-models-explained-part-1/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">LLMs work by analysing vast banks of data to ascertain the next most\n        likely word</span></a></i>" seems to collapse pretty quickly when you look at the results.\n  Self-evidently, there\'s more to it than that, or the output wouldn\'t be so\n  convincing. When I saw the descriptions I was getting, my first thought was\n  that Gemini had to be precising a whole bunch of reviews and picking out the\n  most commonly-expressed opinions but even if that\'s all it is doing, it\'s weirdly accurate.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What it mostly makes me think is that well-known bands and singers have such a\n  definitive, known, recognizable style it can quite easily be encoded in a\n  couple of paragraphs. A test of how accurate that encoding is might be to ask\n  someone if they could tell the band from Gemini\'s description of what they\n  sound like.\n</p>\n<p>And if that\'s not a parlor game, I don\'t know what is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Oh, one other thing.

As I said in the comment thread to his post, it\'s largely replaced\nplaying video games for me, in the way playing games once replaced watching\ntelevision. I very much doubt it\'ll hold my attention for more than two decades, the way\nMMORPGs did, but for now it\'s still feeling quite compulsive.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  There\'s probably a whole series of posts I could write about various aspects of making music this\n  way - practical, philosophical, aesthetic, ethical, legal - but not right now.\n  Today I just thought I\'d share an idea I had for a parlor game, to be played\n  using your LLM of choice, an idea that only occurred to me last night as I was\n  asking mine, which happens to be <i>Gemini,&nbsp;</i>a question.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, when I\'m working with Suno, I make up my whole prompts from scratch. I do\n  re-use a lot of them, often with certain key phrases changed, trying to\n  finesse the exact result I\'m after, but I\'m not usually trying to re-create\n  the signature sound of a specific band or singer, more the sounds I hear in my\n  head.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Occasionally, though, I look at something I\'ve written and wonder what it\n  might sound like if it had been covered by someone I like. Or, for that\n  matter, don\'t like. Even more occasionally I find myself wanting to make\n  something that sounds entirely <i>unlike </i>anything I\'d come up with on my own, both for inspiration and\n  variety.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To that end, now and again, I go to Gemini and ask it to give me a prompt for\n  Suno that describes how a particular genre or band sounds. Feed those into Suno unedited and the results aren\'t often all\n  that close. You can always recognize the influences but it\'s not like you can copy and paste from one AI to another and pump out convincing ersatz albums by your favorite acts like some kind of\n  amateur\n  <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops_(record_series)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Top of the Pops</span></a>&nbsp;</i>knock-off operation. Well, not yet, anyway.\n</p>\n<p>It would be an amusing party game to generate a bunch of those, play them\n  and have people try to guess who they were supposed to be. I can imagine that being\n  a lot of fun with enough drink taken. If I thought anyone would actually take\n  the time to click through and listen, I might have knocked out a few myself and included them here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But that would be a lot of work and I\'d be surprised if more than a handful of\n  readers would be interested enough to listen to even a few bars. That sort of thing really requires a bunch of people together in a room to be fun.&nbsp;</p><p>What would be\n  much easier and also a better game for a blog would be if I just copied and\n  pasted a few of Gemini\'s prompts to see if anyone can recognize the acts from the\n  descriptions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Gemini is pretty good at describing what singers and bands sound like.\n  Disturbingly good, actually. The shorthand explanation of how "<i><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/the-surprising-power-of-next-word-prediction-large-language-models-explained-part-1/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">LLMs work by analysing vast banks of data to ascertain the next most\n        likely word</span></a></i>" seems to collapse pretty quickly when you look at the results.\n  Self-evidently, there\'s more to it than that, or the output wouldn\'t be so\n  convincing. When I saw the descriptions I was getting, my first thought was\n  that Gemini had to be precising a whole bunch of reviews and picking out the\n  most commonly-expressed opinions but even if that\'s all it is doing, it\'s weirdly accurate.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What it mostly makes me think is that well-known bands and singers have such a\n  definitive, known, recognizable style it can quite easily be encoded in a\n  couple of paragraphs. A test of how accurate that encoding is might be to ask\n  someone if they could tell the band from Gemini\'s description of what they\n  sound like.\n</p>\n<p>And if that\'s not a parlor game, I don\'t know what is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Oh, one other thing. When I started doing this, Suno had a two-hundred\n  character limit on prompts. That forced Gemini to be very succinct. I think\n  those make for a better game, although they\'re far less interesting in\n  themselves than the ones it puts up for the new thousand-character limit.\n  Those are more like entries in a musical dictionary.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Shall we try a couple?

It\'s not that I didn\'t notice. I\n  did. I just thought "<i>Huh. That\'s a dumb pun...</i>" and immediately forgot\n  about it.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  With that in mind, it might be as well to treat anything more I have to say\n  about the show with some caution. Clearly I am not going to be a very reliable\n  witness. But, hey, you work with what you\'ve got.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And in that framework, I\'m going to say I found the second half of the season\n  very much more to my liking than the first. Not that I didn\'t enjoy Episodes 1\n  to 4. I enjoyed them quite a bit. I just didn\'t see how they were leading to\n  anything or even going anywhere much.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Episodes 5 to 8 went everywhere and lead to a lot. A lot of deaths. A lot of\n  revelations. A lot of changes. Oh, probably ought to give the spoiler warning\n  now... but that one I used <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/wednesday-addams-half-term-report.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">last time</span></a> was really annoying, wasn\'t it? And\n  everyone here can read, right? So if you haven\'t seen the show and plan to,\n  maybe this would be a good time to go find something else to do. Maybe\n  bookmark this for later. It\'s not like I want to lose the page views...\n</p>\n<p>Okay, we all good?&nbsp; Then let us continue.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I thought all four episodes on the downslope of the season were excellent.\n  Much more engaging than the earlier ones and also less bitty. There seemed to\n  be a lot more of Wednesday and she was more central to the action. The rest of\n  the Addams Family were there but their presence felt more in context, rather than the\n  somewhat shoehorned-in plot mechanics employed in Part 1, when the writers had to come up with a reason for them to be there at all. With their continuing presence\n  explained and established, they felt more like supporting cast members, no\n  different from the teaching staff or the Sheriff, instead of pulling all the\n  attention to themselves and away from the actual star.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Speaking of whom, <i>Jenny Ortega</i> was on particularly fine form, I\n  thought. The body-swap episode, which I loved, made it very clear just how\n  much acting she\'s doing, something that\'s not always apparent. I don\'t really\n  know her well from any of her other work, although obviously I know of it and\n  did before the show even aired, so in my mind the Wednesday Addams character\n  and the actor playing her were mostly interchangeable.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When the most important thing you have to do as an actor is maintain almost\n  the exact same expression and tone of voice throughout, it makes it quite hard for\n  an audience to realize just how much work you\'re doing. With Enid inhabiting\n  her, Wednesday was free to laugh, smile, talk in something other than a\n  monotone and even move her arms as she walked. Or, I should say, skipped!\n</p>\n<p>\n  The opening of that episode, where Enid-as-Wednesday is in full KPop dance\n  mode, is a great shock start and one of the rare times the trope of starting\n  the story at the end (Well, the middle in this case.) and then tossing up the\n  "<i>16 hours Earlier</i>" interstitial actually worked. Honestly, it felt genuinely outrageous. I was ready to be outraged. And then I was charmed and\n  delighted instead, which is a pretty fine bait&amp;switch if you can pull it\n  off.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Speaking of Enid, she gets far more to do in the second half of the season.\n  Oh, sure, she\'s in the first four episodes, all the time, but she doesn\'t know\n  what\'s going on and the atmosphere between her and Wednesday is sour and it\n  never feels comfortable. I know, I know... Wednesday isn\'t supposed to be\n  cosy. But still, you want the team to pull together, don\'t you? I do, anyway.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  <i>Emma Myers</i> is excellent as Enid as always and her story arc develops in a very\n  interesting fashion. As with everything in the show - and in most fantasy\n  shows if we\'re going to be sensible about it - a lot of things don\'t bear\n  close examination. I\'m not entirely convinced by the Alpha lore, or perhaps\n  it\'s the naming convention that\'s confusing. Wouldn\'t the Alpha be the\n  dominant pack member? Why would the pack shun their Alpha, let alone hunt her down and\n  kill her?\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  That, however, may all be explained at some future stage, most likely in\n  Season 3, since the really excellent ending of Season 2 sets everything up for just that. And since I\'ve mentioned it already I\'ll take the end out of order. I just\n  loved it and I can tell you exactly why.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For one thing it\'s a set-up, not a cliffhanger. It\'s the best way to go out of\n  a season, leaving your audience excited for what might come next, rather than\n  frustrated because something got cut off in mid-flow.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  For another, it\'s a very open-ended set-up. It\'s entirely possible the third\n  season of Wednesday might not be set in Nevermore Academy at all. All those\n  problems with the students starting to look like they really ought to be doing\n  post-grad work just fall away if the school setting isn\'t there as a\n  backdrop.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And for the third and possibly best thing (Apologies to the actual <i>Thing</i>.) it brings back\n  <i>Uncle Fester</i> along with the delicious possibility of a prolonged\n  Wednesday-Fester double act. I\'d take a whole spin-off series of that.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Season 3 could be a wilderness adventure, a road-trip or pretty much anything.\n  Or it could be a pre-credit sequence, then back to Nevermore. For\n  that matter, Season 3 could take place entirely in the summer break and Season\n  4 could be the start of the next academic year.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I hope not, though, and I\'m not sure Nevermore is even still in business, anyway.\n  There\'s one line in the last episode, I forget who\'s speaking, where someone\n  clearly suggests the school has closed. Possibly for good.</p><p>For that matter, I was never sure just\n  how much of the school year had passed by the end of Season 2. All the parents turn up and everyone goes home but is that the end of the Fall\n  semester or has a whole year gone round? Or have they all just turned up to\n  take the kids away because&nbsp;the place is on fire and the Principal has just been publicly exposed as a murdering con-man?</p>\n<p>\n  Oh, yeah, and he\'s dead, too. The Principal, that is. And one of the\n  teachers. And there\'s a dead Hyde on the werewolf statue. And a couple more\n  people died earlier. It\'s a bloodbath (Except blood is one thing you never\n  seem to see - it\'s a very not-gory show, oddly.)\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Throughout the season but mainly in Part 2, a lot of people die, including a\n  whole bunch of major supporting characters played by famous guest actors.\n  <i>Steve Buscemi, Christina Ricci, Christopher Lloyd</i>... It seems a bit wasteful but then, just\n  dying doesn\'t mean you\'re not in the show any more.\n  <i>Gwendoline Christie</i>\'s character, <i>Larissa Weems</i>, Nevermore\'s\n  Principal in Season 1 died but now she\'s back as Wednesday\'s spirit\n  guide (She\'s great, too.) and the previous Sheriff, also killed in Season 1, makes a couple of cameo appearances in Season 2, so I wouldn\'t rule out a reappearance from any of\n  them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This is, of course, one of the things that can undermine the emotional\n  significance of... well, any plot development really, in a show like this.\n  It\'s the old horror movie problem, where no-one\'s ever really dead until\n  you\'ve seen the body. Except in fantasy, even if you\'ve seen the body burned\n  to a crisp, it doesn\'t mean whoever burned isn\'t coming back.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m long-since inured to it after a lifetime of reading comic-books.&nbsp; My\n  reactions are in the moment. They pretty much have to be if you commit to this kind of thing. I rarely find myself saying "<i>Well, that would never happen...</i>" while it\'s happening right there before me. Doubt only comes later, when I\'m\n  thinking too much as I write something like this.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After two seasons, it\'s still a little hard to figure out exactly what genre of\n  show Wednesday is supposed to be, always assuming it\'s intended to be any genre at all. It\'s a\n  fantasy-comedy-drama but also a detective show, something I had thought might\n  just be a season 1 thing but apparently is going to carry on. It\'s also\n  quite the soap opera at times and you get the feeling someone really, desperately wanted it to be a\n  romcom until they were talked out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There was some press about that in relation to Wednesday herself, when it was\n  made quite plain, coming into the second season, there was to be no more mushy stuff with\n  the title character. Probably a good decision. Wednesday needs to retain that trademark dark purity and intense focus to be recognizable as the long-established character. The slight fuzziness around the bleak edges as she\n  develops genuine friendships is already enough of a risk, without throwing\n  romance into the cauldron.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Enid picked up the romantic slack for most of the season but I was interested to\n  hear her tell <i>Agnes</i>, the one, very strong, Season 2 addition to Team\n  Wednesday (Sorry - I think I mean <i>The Nightshades</i>.) she was done with\n  boyfriends for a while. Whether that\'s a marker for the future, meaning a\n  further pullback from romantasy, or just a wobble for Enid before she gets her\n  romantic mojo back, I guess we\'ll find out next season. She\'s not going to be\n  going on many dates as an Alpha werewolf who can\'t turn back into a girl,\n  though, so there\'s that to consider.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Agnes, the human equivalent of a set of skeleton keys, makes a much better showing\n  (Ha!) in the second half of the season. I found her a little one-note in the\n  first but as she reveals just a little of her background and personality she\n  becomes considerably more interesting, not to say poignant. Her rapprochement with Enid was sweet\n  and quite touching although I\'ll miss those little spats, pitting Enid\'s\n  spluttering lupine outrage against Agnes\'s cloying, passive-aggressive sarcasm.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Pugsley </i>remains as pointless and charisma-free as ever, but since that\'s his\n  well-established personality I suppose we can\'t complain. By the end of the\n  season I was feeling slightly more sympathetic to him so there\'s some progress\n  but I could happily do without him from now on. <i>Morticia </i>and <i>Thing </i>continue as before although it was a surprise for a disembodied hand to get an actual character arc. I\'m betting <i>Lurch </i>will get one eventually. He certainly hasn\'t had a lot to do so far.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest revelation was the reason for <i>Gomez</i>\'s lack of paranormal abilities. I have always wondered just why he\'s part of the outcast world but now I have two valid explanations. Firstly, as Morticia says, it\'s a matter of attitude, not aptitude, and secondly he did used to have electrical abilities like Fester and Pugsley, so in some odd way he almost represents a disabled Outcast. All this lore fill-in is fascinating. I can take plenty more as the series goes on.</p>\n<p>\n  One thing I tried to notice was whether having an episode be directed by <i>Tim\n  Burton</i> made any appreciable difference. I\'d like to think that, if it did, I\'d\n  have been able to say afterwards which specific episodes he helmed but I\n  don\'t believe I can. I\'m looking at\n  <a href="https://timburton.fandom.com/wiki/Wednesday_episode_list#Season_Two_(2025)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the credits</span></a>\n  now and I see he directed the final two, which I did think were the\n  strongest of the whole season, but I\'m not sure how much that had to do with\n  the direction as opposed to them just being the climactic drawing-together of\n  all the plot points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And those plot points were tied up neatly enough, if not with a pretty little bow. There\n  were a few loose ends left dangling here and there but only enough to give the\n  writers of Season 3 something to grab onto. I found the whole thing a deal\n  more satisfying than I expected after what felt like a relatively baggy and\n  incoherent first half.\n</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>It does make me wonder how smart an idea it was to split the season in the\n  first place. I realize it was done for commercial rather than aesthetic\n  reasons but in retrospect I wonder if it might have had the opposite effect\n  from what was intended. I can imagine a few Wednesday fans feeling somewhat\n  less invested after watching episodes one through four, left perhaps not as excited\n  as they could have been for the rest.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  If the whole thing had either dropped week on week for a couple of months or\n  landed in a big, binge-friendly block, I suspect the story arcs might have\n  felt more coherent (Or noticeable, even.) and the sense of anti-climax that\n  came with the end of the first half might not have been felt, or felt so\n  strongly. It\'ll be interesting to see if Netflix goes the same way next time.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, that\'s likely to be at least a year from now. It\'s a long time to\n  wait, isn\'t it? I don\'t think I used to notice these lengthy gaps so much back\n  when all TV was broadcast in real time. Now, in the age of on-demand\n  entertainment, it does feel very strange to have to wait so long.</p>\n<p>\n  In the mean-time, though, there\'s apparently an Uncle Fester spin-off in the\n  works. Too much to hope it\'ll be that Fester/Wednesday double act I was\n  wishing for earlier. (When I wrote that yesterday I didn\'t know about the\n  spin-off, either...) but I\'ll take it as it comes and gratefully.\n</p>\n<p>To conclude, as a whole, I was happy with Wednesday Season 2. I\'d like to re-watch it\n  without the hiatus to see if it does, in fact, hold together better that way.\n  But not right now.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have a lot going on, as you might tell from the reduced output here at the\n  moment. This should have posted yesterday, neatly on a Wednesday, but outside\n  factors intervened as I imagine they will continue to do for the foreseeable future. I might have to miss more than the odd post. Or maybe not. We\'ll see how things go.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>\n  </p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPLAjDaHDeHaZZ_xT2c0Hn93W5zQpRQAVblNSky9W6M6Bhw8zv43ifDzqI_V4iResRvLUHfoFgg_j73cE8FyW1a4N8WUpPgbI2YOVDjDuDw5c5o06UqgLpG7ri4rINCdcfKxTAmN7d6avj4QuBt1IBTFzXhTgIl8IXFTtKSdgzjS3TABkHUG_OCbaMo5A/s1827/wedrr1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="334" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPLAjDaHDeHaZZ_xT2c0Hn93W5zQpRQAVblNSky9W6M6Bhw8zv43ifDzqI_V4iResRvLUHfoFgg_j73cE8FyW1a4N8WUpPgbI2YOVDjDuDw5c5o06UqgLpG7ri4rINCdcfKxTAmN7d6avj4QuBt1IBTFzXhTgIl8IXFTtKSdgzjS3TABkHUG_OCbaMo5A/w640-h334/wedrr1.png" width="640" /></a></div>It doesn\'t say much for my observational skills or my critical faculties that\n  it was only a couple of minutes ago, when the title of this post popped into\n  my head, that I realized why every episode of <i>Wednesday\'</i>s second season\n  is some kind of pun on the word "<i>woe</i>".

I don\'t really\n  know her well from any of her other work, although obviously I know of it and\n  did before the show even aired, so in my mind the Wednesday Addams character\n  and the actor playing her were mostly interchangeable.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When the most important thing you have to do as an actor is maintain almost\n  the exact same expression and tone of voice throughout, it makes it quite hard for\n  an audience to realize just how much work you\'re doing. With Enid inhabiting\n  her, Wednesday was free to laugh, smile, talk in something other than a\n  monotone and even move her arms as she walked. Or, I should say, skipped!\n</p>\n<p>\n  The opening of that episode, where Enid-as-Wednesday is in full KPop dance\n  mode, is a great shock start and one of the rare times the trope of starting\n  the story at the end (Well, the middle in this case.) and then tossing up the\n  "<i>16 hours Earlier</i>" interstitial actually worked. Honestly, it felt genuinely outrageous. I was ready to be outraged. And then I was charmed and\n  delighted instead, which is a pretty fine bait&amp;switch if you can pull it\n  off.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Speaking of Enid, she gets far more to do in the second half of the season.\n  Oh, sure, she\'s in the first four episodes, all the time, but she doesn\'t know\n  what\'s going on and the atmosphere between her and Wednesday is sour and it\n  never feels comfortable. I know, I know... Wednesday isn\'t supposed to be\n  cosy. But still, you want the team to pull together, don\'t you? I do, anyway.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  <i>Emma Myers</i> is excellent as Enid as always and her story arc develops in a very\n  interesting fashion. As with everything in the show - and in most fantasy\n  shows if we\'re going to be sensible about it - a lot of things don\'t bear\n  close examination. I\'m not entirely convinced by the Alpha lore, or perhaps\n  it\'s the naming convention that\'s confusing. Wouldn\'t the Alpha be the\n  dominant pack member? Why would the pack shun their Alpha, let alone hunt her down and\n  kill her?\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  That, however, may all be explained at some future stage, most likely in\n  Season 3, since the really excellent ending of Season 2 sets everything up for just that. And since I\'ve mentioned it already I\'ll take the end out of order. I just\n  loved it and I can tell you exactly why.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For one thing it\'s a set-up, not a cliffhanger. It\'s the best way to go out of\n  a season, leaving your audience excited for what might come next, rather than\n  frustrated because something got cut off in mid-flow.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  For another, it\'s a very open-ended set-up. It\'s entirely possible the third\n  season of Wednesday might not be set in Nevermore Academy at all. All those\n  problems with the students starting to look like they really ought to be doing\n  post-grad work just fall away if the school setting isn\'t there as a\n  backdrop.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And for the third and possibly best thing (Apologies to the actual <i>Thing</i>.) it brings back\n  <i>Uncle Fester</i> along with the delicious possibility of a prolonged\n  Wednesday-Fester double act. I\'d take a whole spin-off series of that.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Season 3 could be a wilderness adventure, a road-trip or pretty much anything.\n  Or it could be a pre-credit sequence, then back to Nevermore. For\n  that matter, Season 3 could take place entirely in the summer break and Season\n  4 could be the start of the next academic year.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I hope not, though, and I\'m not sure Nevermore is even still in business, anyway.\n  There\'s one line in the last episode, I forget who\'s speaking, where someone\n  clearly suggests the school has closed. Possibly for good.</p><p>For that matter, I was never sure just\n  how much of the school year had passed by the end of Season 2. All the parents turn up and everyone goes home but is that the end of the Fall\n  semester or has a whole year gone round? Or have they all just turned up to\n  take the kids away because&nbsp;the place is on fire and the Principal has just been publicly exposed as a murdering con-man?</p>\n<p>\n  Oh, yeah, and he\'s dead, too. The Principal, that is. And one of the\n  teachers. And there\'s a dead Hyde on the werewolf statue. And a couple more\n  people died earlier. It\'s a bloodbath (Except blood is one thing you never\n  seem to see - it\'s a very not-gory show, oddly.)\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Throughout the season but mainly in Part 2, a lot of people die, including a\n  whole bunch of major supporting characters played by famous guest actors.\n  <i>Steve Buscemi, Christina Ricci, Christopher Lloyd</i>... It seems a bit wasteful but then, just\n  dying doesn\'t mean you\'re not in the show any more.\n  <i>Gwendoline Christie</i>\'s character, <i>Larissa Weems</i>, Nevermore\'s\n  Principal in Season 1 died but now she\'s back as Wednesday\'s spirit\n  guide (She\'s great, too.) and the previous Sheriff, also killed in Season 1, makes a couple of cameo appearances in Season 2, so I wouldn\'t rule out a reappearance from any of\n  them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This is, of course, one of the things that can undermine the emotional\n  significance of... well, any plot development really, in a show like this.\n  It\'s the old horror movie problem, where no-one\'s ever really dead until\n  you\'ve seen the body. Except in fantasy, even if you\'ve seen the body burned\n  to a crisp, it doesn\'t mean whoever burned isn\'t coming back.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m long-since inured to it after a lifetime of reading comic-books.&nbsp; My\n  reactions are in the moment. They pretty much have to be if you commit to this kind of thing. I rarely find myself saying "<i>Well, that would never happen...</i>" while it\'s happening right there before me. Doubt only comes later, when I\'m\n  thinking too much as I write something like this.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After two seasons, it\'s still a little hard to figure out exactly what genre of\n  show Wednesday is supposed to be, always assuming it\'s intended to be any genre at all. It\'s a\n  fantasy-comedy-drama but also a detective show, something I had thought might\n  just be a season 1 thing but apparently is going to carry on. It\'s also\n  quite the soap opera at times and you get the feeling someone really, desperately wanted it to be a\n  romcom until they were talked out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There was some press about that in relation to Wednesday herself, when it was\n  made quite plain, coming into the second season, there was to be no more mushy stuff with\n  the title character. Probably a good decision. Wednesday needs to retain that trademark dark purity and intense focus to be recognizable as the long-established character. The slight fuzziness around the bleak edges as she\n  develops genuine friendships is already enough of a risk, without throwing\n  romance into the cauldron.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Enid picked up the romantic slack for most of the season but I was interested to\n  hear her tell <i>Agnes</i>, the one, very strong, Season 2 addition to Team\n  Wednesday (Sorry - I think I mean <i>The Nightshades</i>.) she was done with\n  boyfriends for a while. Whether that\'s a marker for the future, meaning a\n  further pullback from romantasy, or just a wobble for Enid before she gets her\n  romantic mojo back, I guess we\'ll find out next season. She\'s not going to be\n  going on many dates as an Alpha werewolf who can\'t turn back into a girl,\n  though, so there\'s that to consider.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Agnes, the human equivalent of a set of skeleton keys, makes a much better showing\n  (Ha!) in the second half of the season. I found her a little one-note in the\n  first but as she reveals just a little of her background and personality she\n  becomes considerably more interesting, not to say poignant. Her rapprochement with Enid was sweet\n  and quite touching although I\'ll miss those little spats, pitting Enid\'s\n  spluttering lupine outrage against Agnes\'s cloying, passive-aggressive sarcasm.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Pugsley </i>remains as pointless and charisma-free as ever, but since that\'s his\n  well-established personality I suppose we can\'t complain. By the end of the\n  season I was feeling slightly more sympathetic to him so there\'s some progress\n  but I could happily do without him from now on. <i>Morticia </i>and <i>Thing </i>continue as before although it was a surprise for a disembodied hand to get an actual character arc. I\'m betting <i>Lurch </i>will get one eventually. He certainly hasn\'t had a lot to do so far.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest revelation was the reason for <i>Gomez</i>\'s lack of paranormal abilities. I have always wondered just why he\'s part of the outcast world but now I have two valid explanations. Firstly, as Morticia says, it\'s a matter of attitude, not aptitude, and secondly he did used to have electrical abilities like Fester and Pugsley, so in some odd way he almost represents a disabled Outcast. All this lore fill-in is fascinating. I can take plenty more as the series goes on.</p>\n<p>\n  One thing I tried to notice was whether having an episode be directed by <i>Tim\n  Burton</i> made any appreciable difference. I\'d like to think that, if it did, I\'d\n  have been able to say afterwards which specific episodes he helmed but I\n  don\'t believe I can. I\'m looking at\n  <a href="https://timburton.fandom.com/wiki/Wednesday_episode_list#Season_Two_(2025)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the credits</span></a>\n  now and I see he directed the final two, which I did think were the\n  strongest of the whole season, but I\'m not sure how much that had to do with\n  the direction as opposed to them just being the climactic drawing-together of\n  all the plot points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And those plot points were tied up neatly enough, if not with a pretty little bow. There\n  were a few loose ends left dangling here and there but only enough to give the\n  writers of Season 3 something to grab onto. I found the whole thing a deal\n  more satisfying than I expected after what felt like a relatively baggy and\n  incoherent first half.\n</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>It does make me wonder how smart an idea it was to split the season in the\n  first place. I realize it was done for commercial rather than aesthetic\n  reasons but in retrospect I wonder if it might have had the opposite effect\n  from what was intended. I can imagine a few Wednesday fans feeling somewhat\n  less invested after watching episodes one through four, left perhaps not as excited\n  as they could have been for the rest.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  If the whole thing had either dropped week on week for a couple of months or\n  landed in a big, binge-friendly block, I suspect the story arcs might have\n  felt more coherent (Or noticeable, even.) and the sense of anti-climax that\n  came with the end of the first half might not have been felt, or felt so\n  strongly. It\'ll be interesting to see if Netflix goes the same way next time.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, that\'s likely to be at least a year from now. It\'s a long time to\n  wait, isn\'t it? I don\'t think I used to notice these lengthy gaps so much back\n  when all TV was broadcast in real time. Now, in the age of on-demand\n  entertainment, it does feel very strange to have to wait so long.</p>\n<p>\n  In the mean-time, though, there\'s apparently an Uncle Fester spin-off in the\n  works. Too much to hope it\'ll be that Fester/Wednesday double act I was\n  wishing for earlier. (When I wrote that yesterday I didn\'t know about the\n  spin-off, either...) but I\'ll take it as it comes and gratefully.\n</p>\n<p>To conclude, as a whole, I was happy with Wednesday Season 2. I\'d like to re-watch it\n  without the hiatus to see if it does, in fact, hold together better that way.\n  But not right now.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have a lot going on, as you might tell from the reduced output here at the\n  moment. This should have posted yesterday, neatly on a Wednesday, but outside\n  factors intervened as I imagine they will continue to do for the foreseeable future. I might have to miss more than the odd post. Or maybe not. We\'ll see how things go.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/wednesdays-child.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/wednesdays-child.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPLAjDaHDeHaZZ_xT2c0Hn93W5zQpRQAVblNSky9W6M6Bhw8zv43ifDzqI_V4iResRvLUHfoFgg_j73cE8FyW1a4N8WUpPgbI2YOVDjDuDw5c5o06UqgLpG7ri4rINCdcfKxTAmN7d6avj4QuBt1IBTFzXhTgIl8IXFTtKSdgzjS3TABkHUG_OCbaMo5A/s72-w640-h334-c/wedrr1.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '7'}

As her close on sixty played days suggests, she got out quite a bit. Also, if this series didn\'t have an established format for the titles, I\'d definitely have called this post Born On The Fourth Of July.</p><p>One thing this series has taught me, as if I didn\'t know it already, is that my memory is shot. Even that suggests it was ever any good to begin with, which it most certainly wasn\'t. I have always had a bad memory and waiting a couple of decades to write anything down sure isn\'t making it any better.</p><p>It\'d be lovely if I could say for sure why I decided to roll up a new character on July the fourth, 2004, which would have been very close to the end of my second stint playing <i>EQ </i>as my main MMORPG. To recap a little, the first run lasted from November 1999 to whenever <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i> went live (9 October 2001) and the second from about six months after that until I got into the <i>EverQuest II</i> beta sometime around the end of August or the start of September 2004.</p><p>There was a third substantive phase that began when <i>EQII </i>puttered out about six months after launch, a fourth around the time of the&nbsp;<i>Serpent\'s Spine</i> expansion in September 2006, (That was the expansion that was intended to re-boot the franchise and nearly succeeded) and a fifth and final hurrah, at least as any kind of group player, when <i>Seeds of Destruction</i> arrived in October 2008, bringing with it the game-changing Mercenary feature.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, I\'ve been back a good few times, occasionally for quite long runs lasting several months, but always as a solo player. After I created Ratha in June 2004, though, I never again felt the need to start over from scratch with a brand new character, or at least not one that stuck. I may well roll the final five names on this list into a single post because there won\'t be much to say about any of them.</p><p>Ratha, though, has a very substantial history. And if I could remember it, I\'d tell you what it was. Here\'s what I do remember...</p><p>Her name, for a start. She\'s named after the central character in a novel called <i>Ratha\'s Creature</i>&nbsp;by <i>Clare Bell</i>, the first in a series of novels collectively known as "<i><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_the_Named">The Books of the Named</a></span></i>". She\'s a sentient, prehistoric great cat, who learns how to use fire, so you can see why I went there.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4kbaA8Wj8dYsJavGnYECHIDhHTvf2LsSzhLv8ptWqlc6vzhOShmK6_WVxkiyZtXt-EDks3RD8BLXJ8Yh3zMShueM-PyQ4TL1BF0uzZ_eisENgGBTaiQE9QeOaf28bcmjE-yEsBf96SAfzXvQNNLcZvH0Cf84hXPWj-QjhRLC3Iy7nFo45XytWhIFmdU8/s1487/eqratha2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="306" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4kbaA8Wj8dYsJavGnYECHIDhHTvf2LsSzhLv8ptWqlc6vzhOShmK6_WVxkiyZtXt-EDks3RD8BLXJ8Yh3zMShueM-PyQ4TL1BF0uzZ_eisENgGBTaiQE9QeOaf28bcmjE-yEsBf96SAfzXvQNNLcZvH0Cf84hXPWj-QjhRLC3Iy7nFo45XytWhIFmdU8/w640-h306/eqratha2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>There are five books in the series, published sporadically between 1983 and 2008. I used to review books for a semi-pro comics zine back in the eighties, which is how I got hold of the first and second books in the series. They were review copies. I still have them and they made a big impression on me at the time although not so much that I\'ve re-read either of them since or hunted down the three remaining volumes.&nbsp;<p></p><p>Looking at them online now, I\'m not too surprised to see they\'re all out of print (Although you can get them all on Kindle.) but more so to find they\'re quite collectable. I\'ll have to see if I can complete my set and finish the story.</p><p>As usual with just about every name I\'ve ever given a character in any game, no-one sent me any tells saying they recognized the name or commented on it in any way. There seems to be very little common ground between the kind of books I read and the tastes of people who play these kinds of games. Which, of course, makes those books ideal sources for naming characters.</p><p>So that\'s why she\'s called Ratha. As for why she\'s a Beastlord, not too long before, we\'d been spending a great deal of time grouped with an Eastern European guy around college age, young for our crowd, whose name I forget although I have a feeling it will come back to me <span style="font-size: x-small;">[Edit - it didn\'t.]</span> so I\'d had plenty of opportunities to study the Beastlord gameplay as it was then. And boy was it OP!</p><p>A lot of EQ players strongly disapproved of Beastlords when they were introduced. The pushback was a factor in why the class didn\'t carry over into EQII, only being added there years later.</p><p>They were widely seen as easy-mode upstarts, created by the devs as some kind of sop to the idea that EQ was too difficult - too difficult to play solo and too difficult to get groups, both of which problems Beastlords seemed designed to fix.</p><p>Beastlords could do lots of things other classes could do, making them almost as good all-rounders as Norrath\'s famous jacks-of-all-trades, Bards.&nbsp;The big difference was you needed a lot of skill to play a Bard but any fool could play a Beastlord. That was their reputation, anyway. And it was half-way true. Having spent a lot of time with a couple of the best bards on the server, I knew what an incredible class it was but also how much chance I had of playing one well - none. The Beastlord, though, looked manageable.&nbsp;</p><p>It also looked far more nuanced and interesting than its bad reputation suggested. Played competently, let alone well, a Beastlord could tank, heal, buff, handle crowd control and provide decent dps both at range and in melee. There was always something for a Beastlord to do in almost any situation or any group make-up. Shamans hated them for it because they did everything people wanted a Shaman for - not as well but well enough for most groups - and a lot more besides.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy8sJyqJe0vQUUFo6-gh4hUvlXqBzrVk0F-z4wXmOGSsnt1ckn3-EbRUdIuR4ZTYF1-e8kcos6E_ctXXkCzHc0srcA165jDl76U-mlldpvgo1n_T458KbJ-99Px8mL9cR0dycJKtEtL-Pm7IDLDywKseaJdDEPxR4rteuaN42u6gInWqEKJkDKION7Y2M/s1920/eqratha3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy8sJyqJe0vQUUFo6-gh4hUvlXqBzrVk0F-z4wXmOGSsnt1ckn3-EbRUdIuR4ZTYF1-e8kcos6E_ctXXkCzHc0srcA165jDl76U-mlldpvgo1n_T458KbJ-99Px8mL9cR0dycJKtEtL-Pm7IDLDywKseaJdDEPxR4rteuaN42u6gInWqEKJkDKION7Y2M/w640-h342/eqratha3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>As I\'d seen, though, since we frequently played in groups with a top-class Shaman, the two classes were perfectly able to sync if the players were willing. But then, in those happy days most of the players I grouped with regularly were both skilled and socially competent. I know! Hard to believe, isn\'t it? Shame it didn\'t last.<p></p><p>I do remember that those were my reasons for making a Beastlord. I just don\'t recall now why I needed a new character at all. Just looking at the dates, it\'s unlikely verging on impossible that whatever it was Ratha was meant to do ever got done. Not unless it only took a couple of months and in those days very little in EQ took as little time as that.</p><p>What actually happened that summer before the beta is lost to time but afterwards, when Mrs Bhagpuss and I finally abandoned the listing wreck that was EQII six months post-launch and returned to the safe harbor of the original EQ, literally no-one we knew there was still playing. They\'d all left for... who knows? We only ever saw one of them again.</p><p>For that and other reasons, we declined to pick up where we left off on our established characters and instead started playing new ones. I\'ve already written about our times on <i>Stromm</i>, which I remember relatively clearly, but how Ratha fits in is much more cloudy. She might also have been on Stromm for a while but if so I\'ve forgotten about it.</p><p>What I remember very clearly are the times I spent playing her in a duo with Mrs Bhagpuss. We had a good go at <i>Depths of Darkhollow</i>, the September 2005 expansion that all happens underground and we did a lot of the Serpents Spine<i> </i>expansion together. Ratha was my main character for both of those. I think we got to about Level 50 in <i>TSS</i>, probably stopping before we got to the end of<i> Goruka Mesa</i>, a zone that goes to the mid-fifities.</p><p>When we came back for our final duo tour in Seeds of Destruction three years later, it was for a hugely enjoyable romp through dozens of zones that had previoulsy been far out of our range.

By the starter zone of <i>Secrets of Faydwer</i>, the expansion immediately preceding <i>SoD</i>, our levels had almost caught up with the cap and we had to play properly. Duoing was still practical and fun but it was clear we weren\'t going to get much further and knuckling down to grind out a few per cent of a level each session, while taking care not to get killed, wasn\'t nearly as much fun as romping across whole zones leaving a trail of smoking corpses in our wake.</p><p>That was the last time we visited Norrath together. We moved on to duo in several more MMORPGs, eventually settling down for another decade in <i>Guild Wars 2</i>. Mrs. Bhagpuss is probably done with MMORPGs now, after two full decades playing them pretty heavily. I continue to pick away at the genre, albeit with considerably less enthusiasm these days.</p><p>As for EverQuest, as I said, I\'ve been back plenty of times since that final run in Seeds of Destruction. As I recall, the first time I returned alone, I did pick Ratha back up in the expectation of adding a few levels. She did get a couple more but, while she\'s a competent soloist with a mercenary behind her, it seemed awfully slow compared to what I\'d been used to doing with her. It didn\'t last.</p><p>She ended up, beached in the mid-80s (Like a lot of us...) I did think about using last year\'s free Level 100 boost on her but there\'s not really much point. I would never play her and if I was going to boost anyone it\'d probably be my Necromancer... who we\'ll meet next time.&nbsp;</p><p>Didn\'t I already have a Necro, though? <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/08/7-nickolai-born-9-march-2000-29-days-1.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">I did!</span></a> Well remembered!

As her close on sixty played days suggests, she got out quite a bit. Also, if this series didn\'t have an established format for the titles, I\'d definitely have called this post Born On The Fourth Of July.</p><p>One thing this series has taught me, as if I didn\'t know it already, is that my memory is shot. Even that suggests it was ever any good to begin with, which it most certainly wasn\'t. I have always had a bad memory and waiting a couple of decades to write anything down sure isn\'t making it any better.</p><p>It\'d be lovely if I could say for sure why I decided to roll up a new character on July the fourth, 2004, which would have been very close to the end of my second stint playing <i>EQ </i>as my main MMORPG. To recap a little, the first run lasted from November 1999 to whenever <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i> went live (9 October 2001) and the second from about six months after that until I got into the <i>EverQuest II</i> beta sometime around the end of August or the start of September 2004.</p><p>There was a third substantive phase that began when <i>EQII </i>puttered out about six months after launch, a fourth around the time of the&nbsp;<i>Serpent\'s Spine</i> expansion in September 2006, (That was the expansion that was intended to re-boot the franchise and nearly succeeded) and a fifth and final hurrah, at least as any kind of group player, when <i>Seeds of Destruction</i> arrived in October 2008, bringing with it the game-changing Mercenary feature.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, I\'ve been back a good few times, occasionally for quite long runs lasting several months, but always as a solo player. After I created Ratha in June 2004, though, I never again felt the need to start over from scratch with a brand new character, or at least not one that stuck. I may well roll the final five names on this list into a single post because there won\'t be much to say about any of them.</p><p>Ratha, though, has a very substantial history. And if I could remember it, I\'d tell you what it was. Here\'s what I do remember...</p><p>Her name, for a start. She\'s named after the central character in a novel called <i>Ratha\'s Creature</i>&nbsp;by <i>Clare Bell</i>, the first in a series of novels collectively known as "<i><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_the_Named">The Books of the Named</a></span></i>". She\'s a sentient, prehistoric great cat, who learns how to use fire, so you can see why I went there.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4kbaA8Wj8dYsJavGnYECHIDhHTvf2LsSzhLv8ptWqlc6vzhOShmK6_WVxkiyZtXt-EDks3RD8BLXJ8Yh3zMShueM-PyQ4TL1BF0uzZ_eisENgGBTaiQE9QeOaf28bcmjE-yEsBf96SAfzXvQNNLcZvH0Cf84hXPWj-QjhRLC3Iy7nFo45XytWhIFmdU8/s1487/eqratha2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="306" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4kbaA8Wj8dYsJavGnYECHIDhHTvf2LsSzhLv8ptWqlc6vzhOShmK6_WVxkiyZtXt-EDks3RD8BLXJ8Yh3zMShueM-PyQ4TL1BF0uzZ_eisENgGBTaiQE9QeOaf28bcmjE-yEsBf96SAfzXvQNNLcZvH0Cf84hXPWj-QjhRLC3Iy7nFo45XytWhIFmdU8/w640-h306/eqratha2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>There are five books in the series, published sporadically between 1983 and 2008. I used to review books for a semi-pro comics zine back in the eighties, which is how I got hold of the first and second books in the series. They were review copies. I still have them and they made a big impression on me at the time although not so much that I\'ve re-read either of them since or hunted down the three remaining volumes.&nbsp;<p></p><p>Looking at them online now, I\'m not too surprised to see they\'re all out of print (Although you can get them all on Kindle.) but more so to find they\'re quite collectable. I\'ll have to see if I can complete my set and finish the story.</p><p>As usual with just about every name I\'ve ever given a character in any game, no-one sent me any tells saying they recognized the name or commented on it in any way. There seems to be very little common ground between the kind of books I read and the tastes of people who play these kinds of games. Which, of course, makes those books ideal sources for naming characters.</p><p>So that\'s why she\'s called Ratha. As for why she\'s a Beastlord, not too long before, we\'d been spending a great deal of time grouped with an Eastern European guy around college age, young for our crowd, whose name I forget although I have a feeling it will come back to me <span style="font-size: x-small;">[Edit - it didn\'t.]</span> so I\'d had plenty of opportunities to study the Beastlord gameplay as it was then. And boy was it OP!</p><p>A lot of EQ players strongly disapproved of Beastlords when they were introduced. The pushback was a factor in why the class didn\'t carry over into EQII, only being added there years later.</p><p>They were widely seen as easy-mode upstarts, created by the devs as some kind of sop to the idea that EQ was too difficult - too difficult to play solo and too difficult to get groups, both of which problems Beastlords seemed designed to fix.</p><p>Beastlords could do lots of things other classes could do, making them almost as good all-rounders as Norrath\'s famous jacks-of-all-trades, Bards.&nbsp;The big difference was you needed a lot of skill to play a Bard but any fool could play a Beastlord. That was their reputation, anyway. And it was half-way true. Having spent a lot of time with a couple of the best bards on the server, I knew what an incredible class it was but also how much chance I had of playing one well - none. The Beastlord, though, looked manageable.&nbsp;</p><p>It also looked far more nuanced and interesting than its bad reputation suggested. Played competently, let alone well, a Beastlord could tank, heal, buff, handle crowd control and provide decent dps both at range and in melee. There was always something for a Beastlord to do in almost any situation or any group make-up. Shamans hated them for it because they did everything people wanted a Shaman for - not as well but well enough for most groups - and a lot more besides.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy8sJyqJe0vQUUFo6-gh4hUvlXqBzrVk0F-z4wXmOGSsnt1ckn3-EbRUdIuR4ZTYF1-e8kcos6E_ctXXkCzHc0srcA165jDl76U-mlldpvgo1n_T458KbJ-99Px8mL9cR0dycJKtEtL-Pm7IDLDywKseaJdDEPxR4rteuaN42u6gInWqEKJkDKION7Y2M/s1920/eqratha3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy8sJyqJe0vQUUFo6-gh4hUvlXqBzrVk0F-z4wXmOGSsnt1ckn3-EbRUdIuR4ZTYF1-e8kcos6E_ctXXkCzHc0srcA165jDl76U-mlldpvgo1n_T458KbJ-99Px8mL9cR0dycJKtEtL-Pm7IDLDywKseaJdDEPxR4rteuaN42u6gInWqEKJkDKION7Y2M/w640-h342/eqratha3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>As I\'d seen, though, since we frequently played in groups with a top-class Shaman, the two classes were perfectly able to sync if the players were willing. But then, in those happy days most of the players I grouped with regularly were both skilled and socially competent. I know! Hard to believe, isn\'t it? Shame it didn\'t last.<p></p><p>I do remember that those were my reasons for making a Beastlord. I just don\'t recall now why I needed a new character at all. Just looking at the dates, it\'s unlikely verging on impossible that whatever it was Ratha was meant to do ever got done. Not unless it only took a couple of months and in those days very little in EQ took as little time as that.</p><p>What actually happened that summer before the beta is lost to time but afterwards, when Mrs Bhagpuss and I finally abandoned the listing wreck that was EQII six months post-launch and returned to the safe harbor of the original EQ, literally no-one we knew there was still playing. They\'d all left for... who knows? We only ever saw one of them again.</p><p>For that and other reasons, we declined to pick up where we left off on our established characters and instead started playing new ones. I\'ve already written about our times on <i>Stromm</i>, which I remember relatively clearly, but how Ratha fits in is much more cloudy. She might also have been on Stromm for a while but if so I\'ve forgotten about it.</p><p>What I remember very clearly are the times I spent playing her in a duo with Mrs Bhagpuss. We had a good go at <i>Depths of Darkhollow</i>, the September 2005 expansion that all happens underground and we did a lot of the Serpents Spine<i> </i>expansion together. Ratha was my main character for both of those. I think we got to about Level 50 in <i>TSS</i>, probably stopping before we got to the end of<i> Goruka Mesa</i>, a zone that goes to the mid-fifities.</p><p>When we came back for our final duo tour in Seeds of Destruction three years later, it was for a hugely enjoyable romp through dozens of zones that had previoulsy been far out of our range.

How shows get dropped after one season if they\nhaven\'t picked up traction. How multi-season arcs just fall right off that cliff\nthey thought they were hanging onto, leaving everyone who cared high and dry and\nwondering what the hell happened. Shows with decent ratings get canned because\nsomething else might do better or come to a juddering halt because one of the\nleads did something the platform doesn\'t want to be associated with.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  It\'s not like the old networks were more forgiving or responsible or\n  artistically committed. If anything they were worse in all respects but they\n  were also slower, steadier, less flighty. They did drop shows fast if they\n  didn\'t pick up an audience but first they\'d shunt them around the schedules a\n  bit and maybe try a second season with a new theme tune and title sequence to\n  see if there was any movement. And they always had the holy grail of\n  syndication in the distance so there was some motivation to keep the momentum\n  going, once they\'d gotten the train rolling.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was a real surprise to see news reports predicting\n  <i>"<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/wednesday-could-run-for-seven-seasons-with-netflix-planning-top-secret-spin-off-3880520"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Wednesday could run for seven seasons</span></a></i>". Not only is that very specific, it seems counter to any previous logic.\n  Shows last as long as they hold an audience, keep their stars and someone\n  crucial to the production process doesn\'t get a better offer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And seven seasons of Wednesday, with the slight evidence of just two seasons\n  to go on, wouldn\'t mean even seven years, which would itself be a\n  <i>long </i>time in streaming culture. The show first arrived on\n  <i>Netflix </i>in November 2022 and the second part of the second season has\n  just aired, almost three years later. If they can\'t speed that up, completing\n  seven seasons of Wednesday would take a couple of decades! The students of\n  <i>Nevermore Academy</i> are going to look about as convincing as teenagers as\n  the cast of <i>Grease</i>! by then.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But I\'m not here today to talk about Wednesday. I haven\'t started on the\n  second half of the new season yet. (By the way, as an aside,\n  <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/wednesday-addams-half-term-report.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the post</span></a>\n  I did on the first half of the season was the least-read of all the posts I\n  published during Blaugust, according to Blogger\'s page-view stats, which I\n  find fairly reliable. By quite some margin, too. Given the supposed popularity\n  of the show, that seemed surprising, until it occured to me maybe people\n  didn\'t even click on it in fear of spoilers.

And no, I\'m not going to drop any big reveals of the plot\nor the details but I am going to give away the emotional tenor of the ending. It\nwas good. It felt satisfying. It had some light and shade and a little more\nnuance than perhaps I was expecting.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  In fact, I\'d go so far as to say the production team and the writers have left\n  themselves just enough wriggle room to carry the whole thing on at some\n  unspecified time in the future, if the opportunity arises. It wouldn\'t be the\n  first time a show with a planned ending turned out not to have ended after\n  all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Assuming that doesn\'t happen, though, I\'d imagine most viewers will feel they\n  can live with the way it finished. It\'s mostly a happy ending. Most of the\n  characters you like get to walk off into the sunset with the love of their\n  life (Not that all of those loves can actually walk...) The bad guys get\n  what\'s coming to them, or some of them do, at least. I was very happy with the\n  resolution of Ingrid\'s arc, she being my favorite character. I wouldn\'t have\n  predicted it after Season One, either, so that\'s a gold star to the writers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As for the plot, in keeping with the entire series, none of it really bears\n  close examination. Or casual examination. Any examination at all, really. If I\n  started picking holes, we\'d be here \'til Christmas. But none of that matters.\n  If you start with an unrealistic proposition, everything you build on that\n  foundation is bound to fall apart if you lean on it. So don\'t lean on it is my\n  advice.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just lean back and enjoy it. Let it wash over you and pick what sense out of\n  it you can. It\'s stuffed full of topical references and tiny satires that\n  spill out all over the plot for no good reason so why not just indulge\n  yourself?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRYYNPvhD3SWveaYirjXXPaB02p4mWFVXCZj1UWuLgwrJgGqYVZ-Vcm99xH4blbTLWDehK7TcH6WAuqy2YkJNCjHDDyJ3MAJ8tRbsBz3BKvH6Fc4YPqAgNk7WqeZ0eDgL0pjD_hFl2ck0jO-aw09Mogg8jh9zp2I51EJu9CwxvxKm59WybMzCggOatAcs/s1032/upload4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="318" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRYYNPvhD3SWveaYirjXXPaB02p4mWFVXCZj1UWuLgwrJgGqYVZ-Vcm99xH4blbTLWDehK7TcH6WAuqy2YkJNCjHDDyJ3MAJ8tRbsBz3BKvH6Fc4YPqAgNk7WqeZ0eDgL0pjD_hFl2ck0jO-aw09Mogg8jh9zp2I51EJu9CwxvxKm59WybMzCggOatAcs/w640-h318/upload4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nI\'ll just mention one of those: the Millennial references. They stood out for\nme. I hadn\'t even tried to date the whole thng until then. It\'s in "<i>the future</i>" but if they\'d ever said how far I\'d missed it. This time, though, there were\na couple of scenes with some very specific data points, namely that the central\ncharacters, all of whom seem to be in their thirties (<i>Ingrid</i>,\nspecifically, is thirty-four in the final episode. <i>Nathan</i>, according to\n<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upload_(TV_series)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Wikipedia</span></a></i>, was 27 when the series began.) have Millenials for parents.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  On the most commonly-used generational timeline, the last Millennials would\n  have been born by 1996. The children of Millennials, for the most part, are\n  Gen Alpha, for which as yet there is no agreed date-range but which is broadly\n  seen as covering the 2010s to about now. Even the oldest Gen Alpha wouldn\'t be\n  hitting thirty until around the middle of the century and most of them will\n  get there after 2050.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which doesn\'t seem that crazy. I\'m so used to everything set in "<i>the future</i>" seeming to imagine decades of technological development telescoped into a\n  few years that it seems strange to see extrapolations from current experiments\n  being given something approximating a reasonable development arc. We\n  <i>could </i>have self-driving cars, digital brain scans and sentient AI by\n  the 2050s or 2060s. All of that is being worked on right now. I mean, we\n  <i>won\'t</i> but it\'s not like saying we\'ll have terraformed Mars or perfected\n  matter transmission by then.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, that\'s Upload for you. A very enjoyable show, often funny, sometimes\n  exciting, always heart-warming, never made a lot of sense. I did tear up a\n  little, right at the end, even though the final scene had been telegraphed for\n  most of the last episode.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I\'m sorry to see it end but I\'m very happy to see it end so well.&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXluv_-OvHZfrcVsR0E2I-UnJD_3-6QQ-8smCZ7JC3PdBKcSLVmCnXeFnpcCrrPcgDWoPC-svX2L0F-qP4byvAoKOdBVptTQnyBZF-aeKqhDxUXWulSqeX9x9jL3aWVMAeUvZ2uSi14S_FDzmC96UBTRd1xHzbgYw6uCAAxHOIG_77kIe6oV36jQAmGt0/s1040/upload1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="322" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXluv_-OvHZfrcVsR0E2I-UnJD_3-6QQ-8smCZ7JC3PdBKcSLVmCnXeFnpcCrrPcgDWoPC-svX2L0F-qP4byvAoKOdBVptTQnyBZF-aeKqhDxUXWulSqeX9x9jL3aWVMAeUvZ2uSi14S_FDzmC96UBTRd1xHzbgYw6uCAAxHOIG_77kIe6oV36jQAmGt0/w640-h322/upload1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />We talk a lot around here about how poorly streaming services treat the\nproperties they represent. How shows get dropped after one season if they\nhaven\'t picked up traction. How multi-season arcs just fall right off that cliff\nthey thought they were hanging onto, leaving everyone who cared high and dry and\nwondering what the hell happened. Shows with decent ratings get canned because\nsomething else might do better or come to a juddering halt because one of the\nleads did something the platform doesn\'t want to be associated with.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  It\'s not like the old networks were more forgiving or responsible or\n  artistically committed. If anything they were worse in all respects but they\n  were also slower, steadier, less flighty. They did drop shows fast if they\n  didn\'t pick up an audience but first they\'d shunt them around the schedules a\n  bit and maybe try a second season with a new theme tune and title sequence to\n  see if there was any movement. And they always had the holy grail of\n  syndication in the distance so there was some motivation to keep the momentum\n  going, once they\'d gotten the train rolling.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was a real surprise to see news reports predicting\n  <i>"<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/wednesday-could-run-for-seven-seasons-with-netflix-planning-top-secret-spin-off-3880520"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Wednesday could run for seven seasons</span></a></i>". Not only is that very specific, it seems counter to any previous logic.\n  Shows last as long as they hold an audience, keep their stars and someone\n  crucial to the production process doesn\'t get a better offer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And seven seasons of Wednesday, with the slight evidence of just two seasons\n  to go on, wouldn\'t mean even seven years, which would itself be a\n  <i>long </i>time in streaming culture. The show first arrived on\n  <i>Netflix </i>in November 2022 and the second part of the second season has\n  just aired, almost three years later. If they can\'t speed that up, completing\n  seven seasons of Wednesday would take a couple of decades! The students of\n  <i>Nevermore Academy</i> are going to look about as convincing as teenagers as\n  the cast of <i>Grease</i>! by then.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But I\'m not here today to talk about Wednesday. I haven\'t started on the\n  second half of the new season yet. (By the way, as an aside,\n  <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/wednesday-addams-half-term-report.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">the post</span></a>\n  I did on the first half of the season was the least-read of all the posts I\n  published during Blaugust, according to Blogger\'s page-view stats, which I\n  find fairly reliable. By quite some margin, too. Given the supposed popularity\n  of the show, that seemed surprising, until it occured to me maybe people\n  didn\'t even click on it in fear of spoilers. If that was you, maybe go back\n  and read it now?)\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, today\'s subject is a show that not only managed four seasons before it\n  ended but which also came to a close in a dignified, coherent and satisfying\n  fashion.

The bad guys get\n  what\'s coming to them, or some of them do, at least. I was very happy with the\n  resolution of Ingrid\'s arc, she being my favorite character. I wouldn\'t have\n  predicted it after Season One, either, so that\'s a gold star to the writers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As for the plot, in keeping with the entire series, none of it really bears\n  close examination. Or casual examination. Any examination at all, really. If I\n  started picking holes, we\'d be here \'til Christmas. But none of that matters.\n  If you start with an unrealistic proposition, everything you build on that\n  foundation is bound to fall apart if you lean on it. So don\'t lean on it is my\n  advice.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just lean back and enjoy it. Let it wash over you and pick what sense out of\n  it you can. It\'s stuffed full of topical references and tiny satires that\n  spill out all over the plot for no good reason so why not just indulge\n  yourself?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRYYNPvhD3SWveaYirjXXPaB02p4mWFVXCZj1UWuLgwrJgGqYVZ-Vcm99xH4blbTLWDehK7TcH6WAuqy2YkJNCjHDDyJ3MAJ8tRbsBz3BKvH6Fc4YPqAgNk7WqeZ0eDgL0pjD_hFl2ck0jO-aw09Mogg8jh9zp2I51EJu9CwxvxKm59WybMzCggOatAcs/s1032/upload4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="318" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRYYNPvhD3SWveaYirjXXPaB02p4mWFVXCZj1UWuLgwrJgGqYVZ-Vcm99xH4blbTLWDehK7TcH6WAuqy2YkJNCjHDDyJ3MAJ8tRbsBz3BKvH6Fc4YPqAgNk7WqeZ0eDgL0pjD_hFl2ck0jO-aw09Mogg8jh9zp2I51EJu9CwxvxKm59WybMzCggOatAcs/w640-h318/upload4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nI\'ll just mention one of those: the Millennial references. They stood out for\nme. I hadn\'t even tried to date the whole thng until then. It\'s in "<i>the future</i>" but if they\'d ever said how far I\'d missed it. This time, though, there were\na couple of scenes with some very specific data points, namely that the central\ncharacters, all of whom seem to be in their thirties (<i>Ingrid</i>,\nspecifically, is thirty-four in the final episode. <i>Nathan</i>, according to\n<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upload_(TV_series)"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Wikipedia</span></a></i>, was 27 when the series began.) have Millenials for parents.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  On the most commonly-used generational timeline, the last Millennials would\n  have been born by 1996. The children of Millennials, for the most part, are\n  Gen Alpha, for which as yet there is no agreed date-range but which is broadly\n  seen as covering the 2010s to about now. Even the oldest Gen Alpha wouldn\'t be\n  hitting thirty until around the middle of the century and most of them will\n  get there after 2050.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which doesn\'t seem that crazy. I\'m so used to everything set in "<i>the future</i>" seeming to imagine decades of technological development telescoped into a\n  few years that it seems strange to see extrapolations from current experiments\n  being given something approximating a reasonable development arc. We\n  <i>could </i>have self-driving cars, digital brain scans and sentient AI by\n  the 2050s or 2060s. All of that is being worked on right now. I mean, we\n  <i>won\'t</i> but it\'s not like saying we\'ll have terraformed Mars or perfected\n  matter transmission by then.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, that\'s Upload for you. A very enjoyable show, often funny, sometimes\n  exciting, always heart-warming, never made a lot of sense. I did tear up a\n  little, right at the end, even though the final scene had been telegraphed for\n  most of the last episode.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I\'m sorry to see it end but I\'m very happy to see it end so well.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/sticking-ending.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/sticking-ending.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXluv_-OvHZfrcVsR0E2I-UnJD_3-6QQ-8smCZ7JC3PdBKcSLVmCnXeFnpcCrrPcgDWoPC-svX2L0F-qP4byvAoKOdBVptTQnyBZF-aeKqhDxUXWulSqeX9x9jL3aWVMAeUvZ2uSi14S_FDzmC96UBTRd1xHzbgYw6uCAAxHOIG_77kIe6oV36jQAmGt0/s72-w640-h322-c/upload1.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '2'}

Both of those are sorta-kinda third-person 3D games, which is not really what I\'m looking for.

Maybe combining a bunch of scorched skeleton bones in a burlap\nsack by pressing a big button marked COMBINE feels perfectly normal to people\nunder 20 now.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'d bet the rate of progress doesn\'t though. Boy, is it ever slow!&nbsp;</p><p>Or\n  <i>is </i>it? These assumptions need to be challenged!</p>\n<p>\n  It took a while but it did finally occur to me last night that maybe I might\n  be leveling up faster if I spent more of my time actually killing things and\n  less of it running around the city. In EverQuest in 2002 we didn\'t generally\n  expect to get our XP from quests. We just ran out the city gates ten seconds\n  after we were created and got straight down to killing rats, like any normal person would.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;I find these days - and indeed these last couple of decades - that just\n  the existence of a linear questline is enough to make me forget everything I\n  once knew. In game after game I step on that escalator the moment I see it and\n  do my best to ride it to the top, all the while complaining about how on rails\n  the whole experience has become.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  When I find myself in a game that doesn\'t bully, bribe or cajole me into\n  questing for a living, which neither Monsters&amp;Memories nor Stars Reach\n  does, rather than congratulating the developers on their thoughtfulness and\n  consideration in treating me with respect, as someone capable of setting my\n  own goals and finding my own fun, what do I do? Complain the game is aimless\n  or purposeless or not even a game at all and start bleating on about how\n  there\'s no narrative structure, like some caricature of an actor asking\n  "<i>...but what\'s my motivation?</i>"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just fricking get out there, kill stuff and watch your numbers go up! What\n  more motivation do you need? I tried a bit of that yesterday and it got me to Level Two. Well, that and the quest hand-in...</p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t know. It\'s been a long time, hasn\'t it? <i>Is </i>this what we want\n  any more? Is it what <i>I </i>want?\n</p>\n<p>I guess when Monsters&amp;Memories goes live I\'m going to\n  find out. <i>Pantheon </i>didn\'t do it for me so this is probably the last hurrah of the Golden Age horde.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s\n  looking promising so far.\n</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHmRtst6AJBNWp6rwY5z1HBOqfu_Uw6Aef8T40qJJO9vZwyXbkA72U2hZg62-cUrglsfx6uXD3Vm8LKMyp_-WnXeDjvVEtjxqdWSWzTD0PZ5JV0_zvr_j4Aybm8i16-tgDMkzjU6EFX7K96OujHXAejL0d6bDvo4lHnXbX-iYpfxRWxI0zKUMEr6gyGDo/s1920/m&amp;msun1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHmRtst6AJBNWp6rwY5z1HBOqfu_Uw6Aef8T40qJJO9vZwyXbkA72U2hZg62-cUrglsfx6uXD3Vm8LKMyp_-WnXeDjvVEtjxqdWSWzTD0PZ5JV0_zvr_j4Aybm8i16-tgDMkzjU6EFX7K96OujHXAejL0d6bDvo4lHnXbX-iYpfxRWxI0zKUMEr6gyGDo/w640-h360/m&amp;msun1.png" width="640" /></a><i>Stars Reach </i>isn\'t the only game in alpha (Sorry...\n  <i>pre</i>-alpha...) running lengthy testing sessions just now.\n  <i>Monsters &amp; Memories</i> is also ramping up towards reaching some kind\n  of always-on state later in the year - or perhaps early next year - by keeping the\n  servers up for longer and longer periods.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a "<i>Community Alpha Test</i>" on right now.

Maybe combining a bunch of scorched skeleton bones in a burlap\nsack by pressing a big button marked COMBINE feels perfectly normal to people\nunder 20 now.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'d bet the rate of progress doesn\'t though. Boy, is it ever slow!&nbsp;</p><p>Or\n  <i>is </i>it? These assumptions need to be challenged!</p>\n<p>\n  It took a while but it did finally occur to me last night that maybe I might\n  be leveling up faster if I spent more of my time actually killing things and\n  less of it running around the city. In EverQuest in 2002 we didn\'t generally\n  expect to get our XP from quests. We just ran out the city gates ten seconds\n  after we were created and got straight down to killing rats, like any normal person would.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;I find these days - and indeed these last couple of decades - that just\n  the existence of a linear questline is enough to make me forget everything I\n  once knew. In game after game I step on that escalator the moment I see it and\n  do my best to ride it to the top, all the while complaining about how on rails\n  the whole experience has become.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  When I find myself in a game that doesn\'t bully, bribe or cajole me into\n  questing for a living, which neither Monsters&amp;Memories nor Stars Reach\n  does, rather than congratulating the developers on their thoughtfulness and\n  consideration in treating me with respect, as someone capable of setting my\n  own goals and finding my own fun, what do I do? Complain the game is aimless\n  or purposeless or not even a game at all and start bleating on about how\n  there\'s no narrative structure, like some caricature of an actor asking\n  "<i>...but what\'s my motivation?</i>"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just fricking get out there, kill stuff and watch your numbers go up! What\n  more motivation do you need? I tried a bit of that yesterday and it got me to Level Two. Well, that and the quest hand-in...</p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t know.

Well, let\'s see. There are the potions. I have literally hundreds,maybe thousands of those stashed away and I hardly ever remember to use any of them. I am terrible about using consumables. I pretty much only remember they exist when I hit some kind of difficulty wall and have to start scratching around for any possible toe-hold to scramble over it.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, there hasn\'t been much of that sort of thing in the solo timelines these last few years, long may it continue. It does make all those potions somewhat redundant, though, and even if I did need some, I\'m sure the ones from a tier or two back would suffice. I\'m not going to need the very best ones, not in the content I\'m going to be doing.&nbsp;</p><p>I also don\'t need more unlocks for mount barding slots. I already have plenty of those stored in the bank. They\'re all identical, season to season, and they\'ve been popping out of the reward chests for years.</p><p>Ditto the very useful time-reducing potions that speed up mount, merc and familiar leveling. Again, I need them but I already have plenty. More is always good but I\'m most likely never going to get through the ones I have banked. It\'s certainly not worth the trouble of keeping Overseer going every day just for those.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSWzQKewmbaKb8wW895ZqJoMGVf6MDqk49Gkz_am5JEfuyGsEXhOOXwH2hu8CUgfr-vX3qqjbiyZRBDBEkpmMRQzkvy5P_WFOxl4XC-ln0MHfkCHqvOphwttrfMcodBzKmy-4mK3wxhMWHte_6qfs-uS7JtB7i8sxc0_SH_7SrrlHxb2P5K0GYcNro14g/s331/eq2s7tm.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSWzQKewmbaKb8wW895ZqJoMGVf6MDqk49Gkz_am5JEfuyGsEXhOOXwH2hu8CUgfr-vX3qqjbiyZRBDBEkpmMRQzkvy5P_WFOxl4XC-ln0MHfkCHqvOphwttrfMcodBzKmy-4mK3wxhMWHte_6qfs-uS7JtB7i8sxc0_SH_7SrrlHxb2P5K0GYcNro14g/s320/eq2s7tm.jpg" width="292" /></a></div><p>One thing that <i>is </i>worth it are the rare crafting mats. I would probably keep at it for those alone. I like gathering but it takes two rares to make each Expert scroll these days and just upgrading one new tier of spells for one character gets through sixty to a hundred rares. That\'s days and days of gathering even with all the boosts and bonuses and some good luck on rng and while I find it quite the meditative activity, there are limits even to my boredom threshold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Overseer pumps out a steady stream of rares, all the kinds too, so it\'s easy to sell the ones you don\'t want on the Broker and buy the ones you do. Takes a lot of the randomness out of the process.</p><p></p><p>The other thing I\'d <i>like </i>to get from Overseer is Mercenary Tokens. You need one of those before most of the available mercs in each expansion will entertain the idea of working for you and there are lots of mercs I don\'t have yet. You need as many as possible to boost the stats of your Mercenary Battalion, about which do not ask because I don\'t understand it well enough to explain, but trust me, it\'s a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, for whatever reason, I no longer seem to get any Merc tokens from Overseer. I used to get far more than I had any use for but over the last two or three tiers, although they\'re clearly there in the list of possible drops, I haven\'t seen single one from many hundred of crates. I\'m guessing that\'s some kind of bug but who knows? Also, they used to be tradable and they sold on the broker for coppers, so I probably should look into just buying them next time I log in...</p><p>So, why am I bothering? Just for the rare mats and the hope, one day, merc tokens might start dropping again?</p><p>Well, yes, kind of... but mostly because, having seen just how fricking hard it is to get caught up, I really don\'t want to fall behind again. And also because I thought I was almost there.&nbsp;After today, I\'m not so sure.</p><p>This morning I dinged 60 Overseer, something I\'ve been very much looking forward to because I thought it would put me in the current season, Season 7.

There\'s also an achievement for Level 65 Overseer, though, which reminds me that, even if there\'s no Season 8 yet, I do still have to grind another ten levels just to get to the end of Season 7.</p><p>It never ends. Or rather it does but never soon enough. And now, of course, I have all the "<i>fun</i>" of&nbsp; logging in and out all day to refresh and collect my two (Count \'em! Two!) low-quality, one hour missions.

Of which, more later.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEir6JeXyKh_tlexmU_t7OxQpelQLiON5zqhB6b8N127EK3aYulsVxPXq_B04QgY30K2DAC6KFw5Cr5lALwFg3_4C7fKmzw5zy2wxz_j0rDmQklA8SnuOdqt42_xX_7-sKHqMUuUPBP4dlRecMO-XL9fM_UOl4h6BQoU4_N1AXwcUVAqk_mcjaCVc3Lk2OQ/s607/eq2s72m1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="208" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEir6JeXyKh_tlexmU_t7OxQpelQLiON5zqhB6b8N127EK3aYulsVxPXq_B04QgY30K2DAC6KFw5Cr5lALwFg3_4C7fKmzw5zy2wxz_j0rDmQklA8SnuOdqt42_xX_7-sKHqMUuUPBP4dlRecMO-XL9fM_UOl4h6BQoU4_N1AXwcUVAqk_mcjaCVc3Lk2OQ/w640-h208/eq2s72m1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>Okay, then, the Overseer gear\'s a bust but what about all the other goodies? Well, let\'s see. There are the potions. I have literally hundreds,maybe thousands of those stashed away and I hardly ever remember to use any of them. I am terrible about using consumables. I pretty much only remember they exist when I hit some kind of difficulty wall and have to start scratching around for any possible toe-hold to scramble over it.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, there hasn\'t been much of that sort of thing in the solo timelines these last few years, long may it continue. It does make all those potions somewhat redundant, though, and even if I did need some, I\'m sure the ones from a tier or two back would suffice. I\'m not going to need the very best ones, not in the content I\'m going to be doing.&nbsp;</p><p>I also don\'t need more unlocks for mount barding slots. I already have plenty of those stored in the bank. They\'re all identical, season to season, and they\'ve been popping out of the reward chests for years.</p><p>Ditto the very useful time-reducing potions that speed up mount, merc and familiar leveling. Again, I need them but I already have plenty. More is always good but I\'m most likely never going to get through the ones I have banked. It\'s certainly not worth the trouble of keeping Overseer going every day just for those.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSWzQKewmbaKb8wW895ZqJoMGVf6MDqk49Gkz_am5JEfuyGsEXhOOXwH2hu8CUgfr-vX3qqjbiyZRBDBEkpmMRQzkvy5P_WFOxl4XC-ln0MHfkCHqvOphwttrfMcodBzKmy-4mK3wxhMWHte_6qfs-uS7JtB7i8sxc0_SH_7SrrlHxb2P5K0GYcNro14g/s331/eq2s7tm.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSWzQKewmbaKb8wW895ZqJoMGVf6MDqk49Gkz_am5JEfuyGsEXhOOXwH2hu8CUgfr-vX3qqjbiyZRBDBEkpmMRQzkvy5P_WFOxl4XC-ln0MHfkCHqvOphwttrfMcodBzKmy-4mK3wxhMWHte_6qfs-uS7JtB7i8sxc0_SH_7SrrlHxb2P5K0GYcNro14g/s320/eq2s7tm.jpg" width="292" /></a></div><p>One thing that <i>is </i>worth it are the rare crafting mats. I would probably keep at it for those alone. I like gathering but it takes two rares to make each Expert scroll these days and just upgrading one new tier of spells for one character gets through sixty to a hundred rares. That\'s days and days of gathering even with all the boosts and bonuses and some good luck on rng and while I find it quite the meditative activity, there are limits even to my boredom threshold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Overseer pumps out a steady stream of rares, all the kinds too, so it\'s easy to sell the ones you don\'t want on the Broker and buy the ones you do. Takes a lot of the randomness out of the process.</p><p></p><p>The other thing I\'d <i>like </i>to get from Overseer is Mercenary Tokens. You need one of those before most of the available mercs in each expansion will entertain the idea of working for you and there are lots of mercs I don\'t have yet. You need as many as possible to boost the stats of your Mercenary Battalion, about which do not ask because I don\'t understand it well enough to explain, but trust me, it\'s a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, for whatever reason, I no longer seem to get any Merc tokens from Overseer. I used to get far more than I had any use for but over the last two or three tiers, although they\'re clearly there in the list of possible drops, I haven\'t seen single one from many hundred of crates. I\'m guessing that\'s some kind of bug but who knows? Also, they used to be tradable and they sold on the broker for coppers, so I probably should look into just buying them next time I log in...</p><p>So, why am I bothering? Just for the rare mats and the hope, one day, merc tokens might start dropping again?</p><p>Well, yes, kind of... but mostly because, having seen just how fricking hard it is to get caught up, I really don\'t want to fall behind again. And also because I thought I was almost there.&nbsp;After today, I\'m not so sure.</p><p>This morning I dinged 60 Overseer, something I\'ve been very much looking forward to because I thought it would put me in the current season, Season 7.

There\'s also an achievement for Level 65 Overseer, though, which reminds me that, even if there\'s no Season 8 yet, I do still have to grind another ten levels just to get to the end of Season 7.</p><p>It never ends.

I think. Something like that, anyway.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Which is actually a lot less than I thought. I completely forgot I logged in\n  at the end of May. I thought I hadn\'t set foot in the game since before the\n  <i>Kickstarter</i>.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what I told whoever it is that has the fun job of reading all the\n  surveys and collating the data, anyway. I do like a survey but when I got the\n  email a few days ago - well, the three emails, since I\'m still signed up for\n  the testing program on multiple accounts - I wasn\'t going to respond because\n  what could I have said? I have no clue what Stars Reach is like now, it\'s been\n  so long since I\'ve played.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But then curiosity got the better of me and I opened one of the forms, just to\n  see what they were asking, and it turned out they only wanted to know what\n  people thought of the first hour of the game.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style="text-align: center;">\n        <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjayxABAkeZuxIFPwq1VflrmGMjWy-uLPekB2if8ZzuH-f4w4YYSFnN9RA95CIZDkJmBpAuIstXi-UWL4uzcHd_upsRJPivdyyeVixSwH9lu9fuBMrUapoLTpWdbUEeCA2n_eg3i2j4dVFDroMabyi4TDCmK8KxYnVQIq04rzX0qNDXujRleTVb0L0RkOw/s1120/srdod1.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="349" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjayxABAkeZuxIFPwq1VflrmGMjWy-uLPekB2if8ZzuH-f4w4YYSFnN9RA95CIZDkJmBpAuIstXi-UWL4uzcHd_upsRJPivdyyeVixSwH9lu9fuBMrUapoLTpWdbUEeCA2n_eg3i2j4dVFDroMabyi4TDCmK8KxYnVQIq04rzX0qNDXujRleTVb0L0RkOw/w400-h349/srdod1.jpg" width="400" /></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">\n        <span style="font-size: medium;">Don\'t bother trying to dodge.<br />They use death as a teaching aid here.</span>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nI have been keeping Stars Reach patched up, even though I haven\'t been logging\nin and <i>Playable Worlds</i> is now running a series of lengthy tests as they\ngear up for 24/7 testing. This was on Saturday and I had the feeling a test had\njust started, which indeed it had. In fact, it started last Thursday and it\'s\nstill going as I write.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Why not, then? I could give them an hour of my time and report back on what I\n  thought about it. I mean, I <i>did </i>kind of sign up to test the thing, not\n  to mention be in the creator program (Ironic laughter...) although any\n  responsibility for any of that I ever felt dissipated the moment my credit\n  card got charged for the Kickstarter pledge. I\'m a paying customer now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  First, obviously, I had to make a new character. Well, in a manner of\n  speaking. There is now some slight semblance of a character creation process\n  but it\'s two choices and move on.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a bit of flavor text, which I personally find obnoxious and have\n  already complained about in feedback more than once. Oddly perhaps, I do not\n  find being repeatedly addressed, sneeringly, as "<i>meatbag</i>" endears me to\n  the game or makes me want to come back for more.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All you really get to choose at this stage, though, is your name and race.\n  Everything else is "<i>To be added</i>" or some such excuse. I guess that does\n  at least tell us we <i>will </i>be able to customize our character, one day.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most irritatingly of all, the whole "<i>what you look like changes every time you zone</i>" thing is still going. It\'s disorienting enough to have your character\n  randomized at the start but to have it re-randomized just when you were\n  starting to get used to it is infuriating. If that\'s actually testing\n  something - still - then fair enough but it seems unlikely. In fact, now I\n  think about it, maybe it\'s not even intentional.

It\'s new since I was last there, takes place in\nspace, and goes through the basic controls quite effectively, although it took\nme several goes to get the crawling under the fallen beam part right and the bit\nwhere it gives you a fire extinguisher feels redundant when there turns out to\nbe no fire to extinguish.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  It does a job, though, and the space station looks quite impressive. It\'s a\n  much better way to begin than the previous version.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of the tutorial you have to pick a class. They don\'t call it that,\n  of course, (They call it a "<i>profession</i>".) because this is a classless\n  game where anyone can be anything but it damn well <i>is </i>a class all the\n  same, or at best an archetype. From memory you can be a crafter, an explorer,\n  a warrior or something I\'ve forgotten. Farmer, maybe?\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game tells you not to worry too much about it because later you can do all\n  the things but that\'s like your school-teacher telling you not to complain\n  about having to learn the boring stuff now because it\'ll get interesting when\n  you go to college. Who bloody cares? I want to do something that\'s interesting\n  <i>now</i>!\n</p>\n<p>Or fun. I\'d take fun.</p>\n<p>\n  If I hadn\'t already played about fifteen hours of various stages of pre-alpha,\n  back when you really could do what you liked right from the start, even if\n  there wasn\'t that much of it to do, I think this time <i>would</i> have been\n  fun. New stuff generally is. Without the novelty factor and by comparison to\n  how it used to be , though, it seemed a bit limited. Dull, even.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style="text-align: center;">\n        <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhS0-Jn-E-vFVepI3orQQVVHWe9_RrKOJQD0aI5bmYEIKk8Ec5LMtDHQkbwDrEv8q1i-XWYqU_vp4W8XAaVRxwQR9idXEPuakOq8H6LZ5HWoDdVogAhSpAumuXP8cXdpnNoDc0z-euGCpDXntkf-drc_E2rEgjS08wLopR2FEHLKX22f7ow7RUDernFBxU/s858/srmb1.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="229" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhS0-Jn-E-vFVepI3orQQVVHWe9_RrKOJQD0aI5bmYEIKk8Ec5LMtDHQkbwDrEv8q1i-XWYqU_vp4W8XAaVRxwQR9idXEPuakOq8H6LZ5HWoDdVogAhSpAumuXP8cXdpnNoDc0z-euGCpDXntkf-drc_E2rEgjS08wLopR2FEHLKX22f7ow7RUDernFBxU/w400-h229/srmb1.jpg" width="400" /></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">\n        <span style="font-size: medium;">Ha bloody ha.</span>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nI picked Explorer, which I was well aware would mean running around, listening\nto an echo-locator pinging as I tried to find sixty-four flashing pyramids.\nUnder the new regime, you only get the tools you need for your designated job,\nso it was do that or don\'t do anything at all.

By the time I gave up, after my second (Or\n  was it third?)&nbsp;death,&nbsp;I\'d earned more points in combat-related\n  skills than all the others put together.

I always thought it was an\nattractive-looking game but now it\'s positively gorgeous. The graphics are\nhighly stylized but they really do look beautiful. I took some screenshots and I\nwould have taken more if the camera controls weren\'t so goddam awful. Seriously,\nyou should surely at least be able to 360 around your motionless character\nwithout having to go into the settings to work out how to do it. If it\'s even\npossible. I never did work out how but it may be in there, somewhere.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  The whole time I was playing (Okay, it was only three-quarters of an hour...)\n  the only other players I saw were afk at the revive spot, presumably where\n  they\'d died and wandered off to do something more interesting instead, leaving\n  their characters idling. I\'m sure there\'s something going on somewhere that\'s\n  more engaging than what was happening where I was and that\'s presumably where\n  the players are but I know from experience just how much work there is before\n  you get anywhere near anything like that and I have no intention of going\n  through all those steps again, or not until I\'m confident whatever progress I\n  make won\'t be wiped before the next time I log in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  My brief session did gain me enough experience to fill out the survey, so\n  after I logged out that\'s what I did. I doubt my answers were very helpful,\n  consisting as they did of&nbsp; a lot of "<i>None of the Above</i>s" as a long\n  list of options seeemed to have no relevance to anything I\'d done or\n  seen.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did, however, take the opportunity to write a short essay in the "<i>Is there anything else you\'d like to tell us</i>?" section. I had the good sense to copy and past it into a local file, so\n  here\'s what I said, word for word:&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <span style="font-size: medium;">Before today I hadn\'t played since before the Kickstarter. I\'d pretty much\n    decided by then, after the earlier tests I was in, that it\'s not really my\n    sort of game. No narrative makes it feel directionless and so far there\'s no\n    real way to build a character in meaningful ways, by which I mean working on\n    appearance and personality. Having what your character looks like keep\n    changing outside of your control is a game-breaker, even in a testing phase.\n    Even in a test I need to feel some attachment to my character or else it\'s\n    just like a job I\'m not being paid to do. As for gameplay, it\'s too heavily\n    oriented around skill acquisition all of which takes far, FAR too long.\n    Movement is enervating. I feel physically tired after a few minutes because\n    of the way I have to drag the camera to see anything. Not being able to\n    swing the camera 360 degrees with the character remaining still is very\n    frustrating. Also the combat is deeply irritating. Should be able to play a\n    non-combat character and not have to fight at all. Aggressive mobs have\n    absolutely no place in starter areas, let alone in these numbers. Basically,\n    I find most aspects of the game annoying. It has great potential but the\n    mechanics appear to be almost intentionally getting in the way of any of it\n    being fun. Having played for 45 minutes today, I do think it has improved\n    but I still don\'t feel like playing again. I would recommend it to others\n    because I can see how it would appeal to some people but it doesn\'t do much\n    for me.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I did kind of bang that out in a bit of a temper because, as often tends to be\n  the way, I ended my Stars Reach session feeling quite irritable and annoyed.\n  It\'s a weird experience. The game seems like it ought to be fun but somehow it\n  mostly isn\'t. It\'s a lot of fuss and bother for not very much&nbsp; reward let\n  alone entertainment but it feels like it shouldn\'t be.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the past I\'ve tended to put that down to it just not being my sort of game\n  but really it\'s not all that different, mechanically, to any other\n  survival-crafting game and I\'ve had great times in several of those. So what\n  exactly is it about Stars Reach that increasingly seems to rub me up the wrong\n  way?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Partly, I think, it\'s that this really is still very early in the development\n  process. Most of the time, most of what\'s there works fairly well, which is\n  great, but also means the game has an unfortunate tendency to feel a lot more\n  finished than it really is. It does say right there on the loading screen that\n  it\'s "<i>pre-alpha</i>". You don\'t get much earlier than that.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Much of what feels like it\'s missing feels that way because it really\n  <i>is </i>missing and for very good reason: it hasn\'t been done yet. It will\n  be, one day, and complaining that it\'s not there now seems silly.\n  Unfortunately, if you\'re <i>asking </i>me what the game feels like now, as\n  surveys tend to do, then without all the stuff that isn\'t in yet, well, yes,\n  it probably <i>is </i>going to feel bad. Unavoidable, perhaps, but there it\n  is.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The other thing that puts me off is much more nebulous. Stars Reach just feels\n  like it doesn\'t really <i>want</i> me to be there. It\'s a hostile environment\n  with very few amenities and everything is hard work. And there doesn\'t really\n  seem to be much of a reason why I&nbsp;<i>should&nbsp;</i>be there, anyway. What am I\n  actually supposed to be doing?&nbsp;</p><p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfQI7gEy72vN0JynNrhjv5hw0G58VwgojyJZyfFIAa_lVmtInQSRpyRQ71vyDLd1N5EsKX961P-anTtK2jQz_erxRPOvYcyx_J6M2ZUGAmwmL1fCwhFVCgxYUlcFAmxgMdfBoA14dlVl6DuoC26RSHywVFcaGAZ2u-Tbsz1Q8Pts6N4A9cbapFG0ibfAs/s1462/srfield1.jpg" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfQI7gEy72vN0JynNrhjv5hw0G58VwgojyJZyfFIAa_lVmtInQSRpyRQ71vyDLd1N5EsKX961P-anTtK2jQz_erxRPOvYcyx_J6M2ZUGAmwmL1fCwhFVCgxYUlcFAmxgMdfBoA14dlVl6DuoC26RSHywVFcaGAZ2u-Tbsz1Q8Pts6N4A9cbapFG0ibfAs/w640-h396/srfield1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">One of those games that looks better when you\'re there than in screenshots, I think.</span></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  The snarky narrative wrapper that currently offers just about all there is for\n  context really doesn\'t help. Apparently I\'m an idiot from a race of idiots who\n  messed everything up, only to survive on charity that\'s given grudgingly at\n  best. The game wastes no time in making the player feel positively unwelcome\n  which is a big risk that for me very much does not pay off.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Having the game insult the player, let alone having that be the only way the\n  game communicates, seems like asking for pushback, which in the case of a\n  video game would usually consist of logging out, uninstalling and then\n  bad-mouthing it to anyone who\'ll listen. I imagine there are people who find\n  the "<i>meatbag</i>" routine hilarious. I am not one of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But more than that, there\'s a fug of earnestness surrounding Stars Reach, as\n  if somehow playing it might be good for you. It reeks of being in the Scouts\n  or some kind of social program, where everything builds character or community\n  or is for your own good. Hard to put my finger on why it feels that way&nbsp;\n  but for me it\'s there and it\'s been there from the start.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Again, almost certainly a big positive for some people but not me.&nbsp;I\n  don\'t respond to it well at all and the combination of that sensation with\n  open insults is just weird. And not in a good way.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And yet, as I said in the survey, I <i>would </i>recommend Stars Reach to\n  others. It has the potential to be a solid experience when it\'s finished and\n  it\'s not too shabby even now. It runs well and it looks good and there\'s\n  enough to do to keep you busy for a while, which I\'m sure is more than enough\n  for a lot of people, not to mention more than what a lot of games a lot\n  further along in development can offer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So please don\'t let me put you off if, unlike me, you don\'t mind being called\n  a meatbag every five minutes.&nbsp;\n</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKNZduoNNn69pqouMnOtCCk4inijTbhfYsW039FVK72XtdB1iAwI3VcKkNa3k0Tqg-fvTaoxH9cSkDeT_E_PdoBYtdLiAAPm7EOHzoqsCjz7ApGRL4bO4Npryl_JklZK0nNYCagSF7YV1m2tscQmuivRiuDqLwEtQmGtU5SzrFcQ5vh3w0x0uoxZEK_aw/s1920/srsplash1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKNZduoNNn69pqouMnOtCCk4inijTbhfYsW039FVK72XtdB1iAwI3VcKkNa3k0Tqg-fvTaoxH9cSkDeT_E_PdoBYtdLiAAPm7EOHzoqsCjz7ApGRL4bO4Npryl_JklZK0nNYCagSF7YV1m2tscQmuivRiuDqLwEtQmGtU5SzrFcQ5vh3w0x0uoxZEK_aw/w640-h360/srsplash1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Bless me Ralph, for I have sinned.

I think. Something like that, anyway.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Which is actually a lot less than I thought. I completely forgot I logged in\n  at the end of May. I thought I hadn\'t set foot in the game since before the\n  <i>Kickstarter</i>.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what I told whoever it is that has the fun job of reading all the\n  surveys and collating the data, anyway.

I have no clue what Stars Reach is like now, it\'s been\n  so long since I\'ve played.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But then curiosity got the better of me and I opened one of the forms, just to\n  see what they were asking, and it turned out they only wanted to know what\n  people thought of the first hour of the game.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style="text-align: center;">\n        <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjayxABAkeZuxIFPwq1VflrmGMjWy-uLPekB2if8ZzuH-f4w4YYSFnN9RA95CIZDkJmBpAuIstXi-UWL4uzcHd_upsRJPivdyyeVixSwH9lu9fuBMrUapoLTpWdbUEeCA2n_eg3i2j4dVFDroMabyi4TDCmK8KxYnVQIq04rzX0qNDXujRleTVb0L0RkOw/s1120/srdod1.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="349" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjayxABAkeZuxIFPwq1VflrmGMjWy-uLPekB2if8ZzuH-f4w4YYSFnN9RA95CIZDkJmBpAuIstXi-UWL4uzcHd_upsRJPivdyyeVixSwH9lu9fuBMrUapoLTpWdbUEeCA2n_eg3i2j4dVFDroMabyi4TDCmK8KxYnVQIq04rzX0qNDXujRleTVb0L0RkOw/w400-h349/srdod1.jpg" width="400" /></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">\n        <span style="font-size: medium;">Don\'t bother trying to dodge.<br />They use death as a teaching aid here.</span>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nI have been keeping Stars Reach patched up, even though I haven\'t been logging\nin and <i>Playable Worlds</i> is now running a series of lengthy tests as they\ngear up for 24/7 testing. This was on Saturday and I had the feeling a test had\njust started, which indeed it had. In fact, it started last Thursday and it\'s\nstill going as I write.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Why not, then? I could give them an hour of my time and report back on what I\n  thought about it. I mean, I <i>did </i>kind of sign up to test the thing, not\n  to mention be in the creator program (Ironic laughter...) although any\n  responsibility for any of that I ever felt dissipated the moment my credit\n  card got charged for the Kickstarter pledge. I\'m a paying customer now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  First, obviously, I had to make a new character. Well, in a manner of\n  speaking. There is now some slight semblance of a character creation process\n  but it\'s two choices and move on.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a bit of flavor text, which I personally find obnoxious and have\n  already complained about in feedback more than once. Oddly perhaps, I do not\n  find being repeatedly addressed, sneeringly, as "<i>meatbag</i>" endears me to\n  the game or makes me want to come back for more.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All you really get to choose at this stage, though, is your name and race.\n  Everything else is "<i>To be added</i>" or some such excuse. I guess that does\n  at least tell us we <i>will </i>be able to customize our character, one day.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most irritatingly of all, the whole "<i>what you look like changes every time you zone</i>" thing is still going. It\'s disorienting enough to have your character\n  randomized at the start but to have it re-randomized just when you were\n  starting to get used to it is infuriating. If that\'s actually testing\n  something - still - then fair enough but it seems unlikely. In fact, now I\n  think about it, maybe it\'s not even intentional.

It\'s new since I was last there, takes place in\nspace, and goes through the basic controls quite effectively, although it took\nme several goes to get the crawling under the fallen beam part right and the bit\nwhere it gives you a fire extinguisher feels redundant when there turns out to\nbe no fire to extinguish.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  It does a job, though, and the space station looks quite impressive. It\'s a\n  much better way to begin than the previous version.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the end of the tutorial you have to pick a class. They don\'t call it that,\n  of course, (They call it a "<i>profession</i>".) because this is a classless\n  game where anyone can be anything but it damn well <i>is </i>a class all the\n  same, or at best an archetype. From memory you can be a crafter, an explorer,\n  a warrior or something I\'ve forgotten. Farmer, maybe?\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game tells you not to worry too much about it because later you can do all\n  the things but that\'s like your school-teacher telling you not to complain\n  about having to learn the boring stuff now because it\'ll get interesting when\n  you go to college. Who bloody cares? I want to do something that\'s interesting\n  <i>now</i>!\n</p>\n<p>Or fun. I\'d take fun.</p>\n<p>\n  If I hadn\'t already played about fifteen hours of various stages of pre-alpha,\n  back when you really could do what you liked right from the start, even if\n  there wasn\'t that much of it to do, I think this time <i>would</i> have been\n  fun. New stuff generally is. Without the novelty factor and by comparison to\n  how it used to be , though, it seemed a bit limited.

I did that for\n  about half an hour and found over a dozen, which is more than I expected but\n  fewer that it would have been if I hadn\'t had to keep stopping to fight and/or\n  run from the extremely aggressive wildlife.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style="text-align: center;">\n        <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ6xvtlo_jn0QGGCh4b5ZeZsxjE0bjUP2X0TkVg1mOYe_xh9pZudzETYqPFP8Mxz4X7Ko_pUskXuSibtEbaw2SfIH9POmggFTTLexwYmL47I2chyin_C6vivyL1cKviEtj-PK5_ChvZuefmS-nBhnf0C6qbNc-FSDrr7oZJ7IApn3oHeilD5nRnDB2yFY/s1332/srneb1.jpg" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="221" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ6xvtlo_jn0QGGCh4b5ZeZsxjE0bjUP2X0TkVg1mOYe_xh9pZudzETYqPFP8Mxz4X7Ko_pUskXuSibtEbaw2SfIH9POmggFTTLexwYmL47I2chyin_C6vivyL1cKviEtj-PK5_ChvZuefmS-nBhnf0C6qbNc-FSDrr7oZJ7IApn3oHeilD5nRnDB2yFY/w400-h221/srneb1.jpg" width="400" /></a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">\n        <span style="font-size: medium;">Is this the Down escalator?</span>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nI have been complaining about this design choice since pretty much the first\ntime I ever played the game and while it has improved it\'s still very far from\nacceptable. <i>EverQuest</i>\'s infamous <i>Gates of Discord</i> expansion should\nnot be the template for newbie zones in any game.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  They do at least give you a gun - an Omniblaster - no matter what class you\n  pick, so you can try to defend yourself but good luck with that when you get\n  swarmed, as you inevitably will. By the time I gave up, after my second (Or\n  was it third?)&nbsp;death,&nbsp;I\'d earned more points in combat-related\n  skills than all the others put together. That seems ridiculous, especially\n  when I thought I\'d picked a non-combat class so I wouldn\'t need to fight\n  anything. Can\'t say I was surprised about it though.

I always thought it was an\nattractive-looking game but now it\'s positively gorgeous. The graphics are\nhighly stylized but they really do look beautiful. I took some screenshots and I\nwould have taken more if the camera controls weren\'t so goddam awful. Seriously,\nyou should surely at least be able to 360 around your motionless character\nwithout having to go into the settings to work out how to do it. If it\'s even\npossible. I never did work out how but it may be in there, somewhere.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  The whole time I was playing (Okay, it was only three-quarters of an hour...)\n  the only other players I saw were afk at the revive spot, presumably where\n  they\'d died and wandered off to do something more interesting instead, leaving\n  their characters idling. I\'m sure there\'s something going on somewhere that\'s\n  more engaging than what was happening where I was and that\'s presumably where\n  the players are but I know from experience just how much work there is before\n  you get anywhere near anything like that and I have no intention of going\n  through all those steps again, or not until I\'m confident whatever progress I\n  make won\'t be wiped before the next time I log in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  My brief session did gain me enough experience to fill out the survey, so\n  after I logged out that\'s what I did. I doubt my answers were very helpful,\n  consisting as they did of&nbsp; a lot of "<i>None of the Above</i>s" as a long\n  list of options seeemed to have no relevance to anything I\'d done or\n  seen.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did, however, take the opportunity to write a short essay in the "<i>Is there anything else you\'d like to tell us</i>?" section. I had the good sense to copy and past it into a local file, so\n  here\'s what I said, word for word:&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <span style="font-size: medium;">Before today I hadn\'t played since before the Kickstarter. I\'d pretty much\n    decided by then, after the earlier tests I was in, that it\'s not really my\n    sort of game. No narrative makes it feel directionless and so far there\'s no\n    real way to build a character in meaningful ways, by which I mean working on\n    appearance and personality. Having what your character looks like keep\n    changing outside of your control is a game-breaker, even in a testing phase.\n    Even in a test I need to feel some attachment to my character or else it\'s\n    just like a job I\'m not being paid to do. As for gameplay, it\'s too heavily\n    oriented around skill acquisition all of which takes far, FAR too long.\n    Movement is enervating. I feel physically tired after a few minutes because\n    of the way I have to drag the camera to see anything. Not being able to\n    swing the camera 360 degrees with the character remaining still is very\n    frustrating. Also the combat is deeply irritating. Should be able to play a\n    non-combat character and not have to fight at all. Aggressive mobs have\n    absolutely no place in starter areas, let alone in these numbers. Basically,\n    I find most aspects of the game annoying. It has great potential but the\n    mechanics appear to be almost intentionally getting in the way of any of it\n    being fun. Having played for 45 minutes today, I do think it has improved\n    but I still don\'t feel like playing again. I would recommend it to others\n    because I can see how it would appeal to some people but it doesn\'t do much\n    for me.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I did kind of bang that out in a bit of a temper because, as often tends to be\n  the way, I ended my Stars Reach session feeling quite irritable and annoyed.\n  It\'s a weird experience. The game seems like it ought to be fun but somehow it\n  mostly isn\'t. It\'s a lot of fuss and bother for not very much&nbsp; reward let\n  alone entertainment but it feels like it shouldn\'t be.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the past I\'ve tended to put that down to it just not being my sort of game\n  but really it\'s not all that different, mechanically, to any other\n  survival-crafting game and I\'ve had great times in several of those. So what\n  exactly is it about Stars Reach that increasingly seems to rub me up the wrong\n  way?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Partly, I think, it\'s that this really is still very early in the development\n  process. Most of the time, most of what\'s there works fairly well, which is\n  great, but also means the game has an unfortunate tendency to feel a lot more\n  finished than it really is. It does say right there on the loading screen that\n  it\'s "<i>pre-alpha</i>". You don\'t get much earlier than that.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Much of what feels like it\'s missing feels that way because it really\n  <i>is </i>missing and for very good reason: it hasn\'t been done yet. It will\n  be, one day, and complaining that it\'s not there now seems silly.\n  Unfortunately, if you\'re <i>asking </i>me what the game feels like now, as\n  surveys tend to do, then without all the stuff that isn\'t in yet, well, yes,\n  it probably <i>is </i>going to feel bad. Unavoidable, perhaps, but there it\n  is.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The other thing that puts me off is much more nebulous. Stars Reach just feels\n  like it doesn\'t really <i>want</i> me to be there. It\'s a hostile environment\n  with very few amenities and everything is hard work. And there doesn\'t really\n  seem to be much of a reason why I&nbsp;<i>should&nbsp;</i>be there, anyway. What am I\n  actually supposed to be doing?&nbsp;</p><p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfQI7gEy72vN0JynNrhjv5hw0G58VwgojyJZyfFIAa_lVmtInQSRpyRQ71vyDLd1N5EsKX961P-anTtK2jQz_erxRPOvYcyx_J6M2ZUGAmwmL1fCwhFVCgxYUlcFAmxgMdfBoA14dlVl6DuoC26RSHywVFcaGAZ2u-Tbsz1Q8Pts6N4A9cbapFG0ibfAs/s1462/srfield1.jpg" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfQI7gEy72vN0JynNrhjv5hw0G58VwgojyJZyfFIAa_lVmtInQSRpyRQ71vyDLd1N5EsKX961P-anTtK2jQz_erxRPOvYcyx_J6M2ZUGAmwmL1fCwhFVCgxYUlcFAmxgMdfBoA14dlVl6DuoC26RSHywVFcaGAZ2u-Tbsz1Q8Pts6N4A9cbapFG0ibfAs/w640-h396/srfield1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">One of those games that looks better when you\'re there than in screenshots, I think.</span></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  The snarky narrative wrapper that currently offers just about all there is for\n  context really doesn\'t help. Apparently I\'m an idiot from a race of idiots who\n  messed everything up, only to survive on charity that\'s given grudgingly at\n  best. The game wastes no time in making the player feel positively unwelcome\n  which is a big risk that for me very much does not pay off.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Having the game insult the player, let alone having that be the only way the\n  game communicates, seems like asking for pushback, which in the case of a\n  video game would usually consist of logging out, uninstalling and then\n  bad-mouthing it to anyone who\'ll listen. I imagine there are people who find\n  the "<i>meatbag</i>" routine hilarious. I am not one of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But more than that, there\'s a fug of earnestness surrounding Stars Reach, as\n  if somehow playing it might be good for you. It reeks of being in the Scouts\n  or some kind of social program, where everything builds character or community\n  or is for your own good. Hard to put my finger on why it feels that way&nbsp;\n  but for me it\'s there and it\'s been there from the start.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Again, almost certainly a big positive for some people but not me.&nbsp;I\n  don\'t respond to it well at all and the combination of that sensation with\n  open insults is just weird. And not in a good way.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And yet, as I said in the survey, I <i>would </i>recommend Stars Reach to\n  others. It has the potential to be a solid experience when it\'s finished and\n  it\'s not too shabby even now. It runs well and it looks good and there\'s\n  enough to do to keep you busy for a while, which I\'m sure is more than enough\n  for a lot of people, not to mention more than what a lot of games a lot\n  further along in development can offer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So please don\'t let me put you off if, unlike me, you don\'t mind being called\n  a meatbag every five minutes.&nbsp;\n</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/hey-stars-reach-its-been-while-hows-it.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/hey-stars-reach-its-been-while-hows-it.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKNZduoNNn69pqouMnOtCCk4inijTbhfYsW039FVK72XtdB1iAwI3VcKkNa3k0Tqg-fvTaoxH9cSkDeT_E_PdoBYtdLiAAPm7EOHzoqsCjz7ApGRL4bO4Npryl_JklZK0nNYCagSF7YV1m2tscQmuivRiuDqLwEtQmGtU5SzrFcQ5vh3w0x0uoxZEK_aw/s72-w640-h360-c/srsplash1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

Has it been fun? I\'d say so.<p></p><p>I was going to run this after the event had ended but it makes more sense to keep it in bounds. Who knows? Maybe someone I\'m shouting out will even see it now!</p><p>As I said a few posts ago (Not going to go digging back through them all to link to it.) for the first time ever I\'m actually going to name-and-praise the new-to-me and new to Blaugust blogs I really enjoyed. Handily, I put all the fresh names in a separate pot over in <i>Feedly </i>right at the start so it\'s pretty easy to find them. God knows it wouldn\'t be if all I had to work with was my memory.</p><p>I\'d say they\'re in no particular order - I\'m certainly not ranking them - but since I used the handy OPML file gifted to us by <i>Owls </i>and that\'s alphabetical, that\'s what order they\'re in. Other alphabets are available.</p><p>All of the following will be staying in my RSS feeds long after Blaugust ends.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://amf.didiermary.fr/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>African Music Forum</b> </span></span></a>-&nbsp; There were several all-music blogs in this year\'s line-up and at the start I would have bet against this being the one I\'d end up enjoying and listening to the most but the others seemed to focus on music I found very dull so I stopped clicking through after a few posts. I\'ve never been much of a "<i>world music</i>" fan although I\'ve certainly heard plenty over the last few decades. I went to the first-ever <i>WOMAD </i>festival but never felt like going to another and there was a time when I thought if <i>John Peel </i>didn\'t stop playing so much highlife I\'d have to find someone else to listen to late in the evenings. All of that notwithstanding, I thoroughly enjoyed lots of the tracks and artists <i>AFM</i> introduced me to during Blaugust, especially all the funk and jazz.&nbsp;</p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="https://jeddacp.me/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">august morning</span></a></span></b> -&nbsp; There are never as many picture-focused blogs in Blaugust as I could wish. Or in the blogosphere generally, for that matter. I\'m guessing most people who want to post photos do it on <i>Instagram</i>. Maybe I should look there. Except I don\'t even have an Instagram account. Which all means I was very happy to see this one, the picture-oriented blog of <i>Jedda</i>, also responsible for another blog on this list.</p><p><a href="https://axxuy.xyz/blog/"><b><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><span style="font-size: large;">Axxuy </span></span></b></a>- Short, friendly, varied posts on a restful green background.&nbsp;I bookmarked several posts by <i>axxuy </i>as possible bounce-offs during the month, mentioned the blog in a couple in dispatches and finally went the full bounce <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/but-i-dont-like-football.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">yesterday</span></a>.&nbsp; At first I thought it was going to be a whole blog about vintage typewriters, which would have been fine, but it opened out to be about all kinds of things and always interesting.</p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="https://www.calishat.com/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Calishat </span></a></span></b>- Another I bookmarked several times. I liked the chatty and engaging style but this one also has great pracical value. I\'ve already used a couple of the search apps and I\'m keeping them to hand for the future.</p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Joelchrono\'s Blog</span></a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;- Always a fun read. Very chatty and easy-going. I liked all the gaming stuff but even better were the throwaway asides giving a glimpse of everday life in Mexico. This is the sort of thing I used to eavesdrop on in the old <i>GeoCities </i>days. I don\'t miss most of that, especially not the juddering, jarring graphics, but I do miss the casual visits to other people\'s lives, something the more structured blogs we have now don\'t always offer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="https://notes.jeddacp.com/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Notes by JCProbably</span></a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;"> -&nbsp; And here\'s another one. Again, it\'s a window into another world or I should say another part of this one. One thing I particularly like about <i>JCProbably </i>is the creative use of fonts. It brings home what I was saying about how we, collectively, seem to have forgotten some of the creativity that used to come with paper and paste. If I steal anything from anyone in Blaugust this year it\'ll most likely be the use of script instead of italics. This is Jedda\'s other blog, by the way, although I\'m sure you all knew that.</span></p><p><span style="color: #ff00fe; font-size: large;"><b><a href="https://www.reayjespersen.com/">Reay Jespersen</a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #ff00fe;"> </span>- Along with the previous one, possibly the most personal of the personal blogs this time around. A real web log of what\'s going on in someone\'s life, or in their mind, or both, which if we\'re going to be brutal about it, is only going to hold a stranger\'s attention if it\'s a very interesting life or if someone has some very interesting ideas or if they\'re blessed with the knack of making one or other or both sound interesting. At least two of those hold true here. I read every post with interest, attention and pleasure. Even left a couple of comments.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://ribo.zone"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">ribo.zone</span></a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;"> -&nbsp; I was enjoying this one until it stopped about half-way through the month with a post about being half-way through... very meta! Another soothingly pastel green blog with plenty of what I learned is called "<i>dithering</i>". I was clearly lying when I said the only thing I\'d steal this time would be the script fonts. I\'ve already stolen the dithering and used it several times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="https://hollie.eilloh.net/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Small Good Things</span></a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;"> - Another one that signed out half way through, only this time with an actual goodbye. I was very sorry to see it go although I understood the reasons clearly enough. There are plenty of blogs in my feeds that talk about health issues sometimes, particularly mental health, but I don\'t often feel I\'ve learned something new the way I did with this one. It helped that <i>Hollie </i>was learning them at the same time, I guess. I hope everything\'s working out and if and when you\'re feeling ready to blog again, I\'ll be happy to hear about it. This is why I never remove blogs I like from my feeds even when they go silent. It\'s always nice to think one day they might spring back into life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="https://virtualmoose.org/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The Virtual Moose</span></a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;"> -&nbsp; Just a solid, interesting, well-presented blog that kept coming up with interesting reads throughout the month. I <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/a-funny-thing-happened.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">bounced</span></a><span style="color: #ff00fe;">&nbsp;</span>off one of them, thinking it was a subject that might get some traction and of course it got no response at all. (Well, not about the actual topic, anyway.) How very Blaugust.

Has it been fun? I\'d say so.<p></p><p>I was going to run this after the event had ended but it makes more sense to keep it in bounds. Who knows? Maybe someone I\'m shouting out will even see it now!</p><p>As I said a few posts ago (Not going to go digging back through them all to link to it.) for the first time ever I\'m actually going to name-and-praise the new-to-me and new to Blaugust blogs I really enjoyed. Handily, I put all the fresh names in a separate pot over in <i>Feedly </i>right at the start so it\'s pretty easy to find them. God knows it wouldn\'t be if all I had to work with was my memory.</p><p>I\'d say they\'re in no particular order - I\'m certainly not ranking them - but since I used the handy OPML file gifted to us by <i>Owls </i>and that\'s alphabetical, that\'s what order they\'re in. Other alphabets are available.</p><p>All of the following will be staying in my RSS feeds long after Blaugust ends.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://amf.didiermary.fr/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>African Music Forum</b> </span></span></a>-&nbsp; There were several all-music blogs in this year\'s line-up and at the start I would have bet against this being the one I\'d end up enjoying and listening to the most but the others seemed to focus on music I found very dull so I stopped clicking through after a few posts. I\'ve never been much of a "<i>world music</i>" fan although I\'ve certainly heard plenty over the last few decades. I went to the first-ever <i>WOMAD </i>festival but never felt like going to another and there was a time when I thought if <i>John Peel </i>didn\'t stop playing so much highlife I\'d have to find someone else to listen to late in the evenings. All of that notwithstanding, I thoroughly enjoyed lots of the tracks and artists <i>AFM</i> introduced me to during Blaugust, especially all the funk and jazz.&nbsp;</p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="https://jeddacp.me/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">august morning</span></a></span></b> -&nbsp; There are never as many picture-focused blogs in Blaugust as I could wish. Or in the blogosphere generally, for that matter. I\'m guessing most people who want to post photos do it on <i>Instagram</i>. Maybe I should look there. Except I don\'t even have an Instagram account. Which all means I was very happy to see this one, the picture-oriented blog of <i>Jedda</i>, also responsible for another blog on this list.</p><p><a href="https://axxuy.xyz/blog/"><b><span style="color: #ff00fe;"><span style="font-size: large;">Axxuy </span></span></b></a>- Short, friendly, varied posts on a restful green background.&nbsp;I bookmarked several posts by <i>axxuy </i>as possible bounce-offs during the month, mentioned the blog in a couple in dispatches and finally went the full bounce <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/but-i-dont-like-football.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">yesterday</span></a>.&nbsp; At first I thought it was going to be a whole blog about vintage typewriters, which would have been fine, but it opened out to be about all kinds of things and always interesting.</p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="https://www.calishat.com/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Calishat </span></a></span></b>- Another I bookmarked several times. I liked the chatty and engaging style but this one also has great pracical value. I\'ve already used a couple of the search apps and I\'m keeping them to hand for the future.</p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Joelchrono\'s Blog</span></a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;- Always a fun read. Very chatty and easy-going. I liked all the gaming stuff but even better were the throwaway asides giving a glimpse of everday life in Mexico. This is the sort of thing I used to eavesdrop on in the old <i>GeoCities </i>days. I don\'t miss most of that, especially not the juddering, jarring graphics, but I do miss the casual visits to other people\'s lives, something the more structured blogs we have now don\'t always offer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="https://notes.jeddacp.com/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Notes by JCProbably</span></a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;"> -&nbsp; And here\'s another one. Again, it\'s a window into another world or I should say another part of this one. One thing I particularly like about <i>JCProbably </i>is the creative use of fonts. It brings home what I was saying about how we, collectively, seem to have forgotten some of the creativity that used to come with paper and paste. If I steal anything from anyone in Blaugust this year it\'ll most likely be the use of script instead of italics. This is Jedda\'s other blog, by the way, although I\'m sure you all knew that.</span></p><p><span style="color: #ff00fe; font-size: large;"><b><a href="https://www.reayjespersen.com/">Reay Jespersen</a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #ff00fe;"> </span>- Along with the previous one, possibly the most personal of the personal blogs this time around. A real web log of what\'s going on in someone\'s life, or in their mind, or both, which if we\'re going to be brutal about it, is only going to hold a stranger\'s attention if it\'s a very interesting life or if someone has some very interesting ideas or if they\'re blessed with the knack of making one or other or both sound interesting. At least two of those hold true here. I read every post with interest, attention and pleasure. Even left a couple of comments.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://ribo.zone"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">ribo.zone</span></a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;"> -&nbsp; I was enjoying this one until it stopped about half-way through the month with a post about being half-way through... very meta! Another soothingly pastel green blog with plenty of what I learned is called "<i>dithering</i>". I was clearly lying when I said the only thing I\'d steal this time would be the script fonts. I\'ve already stolen the dithering and used it several times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="https://hollie.eilloh.net/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Small Good Things</span></a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;"> - Another one that signed out half way through, only this time with an actual goodbye. I was very sorry to see it go although I understood the reasons clearly enough. There are plenty of blogs in my feeds that talk about health issues sometimes, particularly mental health, but I don\'t often feel I\'ve learned something new the way I did with this one. It helped that <i>Hollie </i>was learning them at the same time, I guess. I hope everything\'s working out and if and when you\'re feeling ready to blog again, I\'ll be happy to hear about it. This is why I never remove blogs I like from my feeds even when they go silent. It\'s always nice to think one day they might spring back into life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="https://virtualmoose.org/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The Virtual Moose</span></a></b></span><span style="font-size: small;"> -&nbsp; Just a solid, interesting, well-presented blog that kept coming up with interesting reads throughout the month. I <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/a-funny-thing-happened.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">bounced</span></a><span style="color: #ff00fe;">&nbsp;</span>off one of them, thinking it was a subject that might get some traction and of course it got no response at all. (Well, not about the actual topic, anyway.) How very Blaugust.
