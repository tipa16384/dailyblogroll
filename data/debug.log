The game appears (and plays) like an aquatic combination of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/18/coffee-talk-review/">Coffee Talk</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/15/steamworld-dig-2-review/">SteamWorld Dig</a></em>, which are both games I very much enjoy. I downloaded <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> upon release on Switch, but it fell into my backlog until this year; in recent months, I&#8217;ve gotten around to properly playing through the game, and I&#8217;m glad I did so &#8211; not only does it deliver on the rewarding gameplay loop and sumptuous pixel art graphics I hoped for, but it&#8217;s been an ideal showcase for chilled handheld gaming on the Nintendo Switch 2!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting the review, I&#8217;d like to mention the brief controversy around <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, as I remember it adding unfair caution to my approach to the game. Back in 2023, the game was nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards, which drew criticism because the game wasn&#8217;t an Indie game &#8211; the developer MINTROCKET was a subsidiary of Nexon, a lucrative South Korean company. The developers were not responsible for the game being nominated, and it appears that the nomination was based off of the pixel art graphics and relaxed alternative vibe of the game, instead of the literal definition of an independent company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, the CEO of MINTROCKET &#8211; and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> creator &#8211; Jaeho Hwang said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>“I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like a more detailed explanation and opinion, I highly recommend <a href="https://indiecator.org/2023/11/15/why-is-dave-the-diver-not-indie/">this post on <em>Indiecator</em> by MagiWasTaken</a>, which discusses the situation in better detail than I could in this short review introduction. Ironically, it&#8217;s since been announced in 2024 that MINTROCKET is becoming independent (albeit with support from Nexon to carry out the move). My main point is that this controversy is not something to think ill of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> or MINTROCKET for, and that allowed me to dive into the game fresh. Right, that&#8217;s enough preamble, so let&#8217;s get into the review!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Catch of the Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> follows the story of Dave and his friends, who&#8217;ve travelled to the oceanic Blue Hole to set up a sushi restaurant called Bancho Sushi (named after the head chef Bancho). As the title suggests, Dave must dive underwater to collect the fish and ingredients, and this forms the majority of the game &#8211; you must balance risk and reward as you collect as much as Dave can carry, whilst keeping track of your oxygen levels and means to get back to the surface &#8211; either by swimming back up, or finding an Escape Pod point. If you run out of oxygen and get stranded underwater, you lose all but one of your collected items, which severely impacts the success of the sushi restaurant in the evenings. This risk/reward system is reminiscent of the digging in <em>SteamWorld Dig</em>, and is implemented superbly here &#8211; the player has to make the tough decision between keeping what they&#8217;ve got, or risking pushing a little further and potentially losing it all. It&#8217;s a brilliant gameplay loop that keeps you coming back for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15160" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15140" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15139" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The game eases you in gently, starting with introducing the mechanics of catching fish at a relatively shallow depth. Your main weapon is the harpoon, which can be fired in front of you to reel in fish. However, there&#8217;s a delay whilst the fish struggles, which gives other dangerous creatures the time to close in on Dave &#8211; and later on, the harpoon requires multiple hits and/or extra button combinations to capture stronger fish. There are also various items to discover and collect, either as supplementary ingredients found in submerged cooking pots, or as materials scattered on the sea floor. Dave only has a certain amount they can hold at once, which quickly becomes reason to earn the Gold needed for upgrading your Cargo Box storage limit &#8211; as well as your Air Tank, Harpoon Gun, and more. In turn, this motivates the player for the sushi segments of the game; depending on how well the restaurant performs in the evenings, the more Gold you&#8217;ll earn for upgrades. Both sides of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> continue to ingeniously compliment each other in this way, as success in one helps you in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the sushi segments are rather different from the diving, and this is where my earlier comparison to <em>Coffee Talk</em> comes in. After setting sail to Bancho Sushi, you start by going through a list of your possible dishes to serve in your evening menu; your selection is based upon the fish you&#8217;ve caught and the ingredients you&#8217;ve acquired. The quality and quantity of your haul determines your success, as rarer fish open up more expensive dishes that result in a more lucrative evening. Upon selecting each dish, you can also enhance it if you have enough excess ingredients &#8211; a process given extra visual flair by the wonderful animated cutscenes of Bancho preparing the food. These animations aren&#8217;t limited to just Bancho, and are sprinkled throughout <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, such as when weapons expert Duff upgrades your guns. Each of these sequences has a tongue-in-cheek over-exaggerated tone, and add to the playful charm of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15133" height="360" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif?w=640" width="640" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in Bancho Sushi you can browse and sell your ingredients for quickfire Gold, as well as decorate the restaurant as you see fit, and even hire extra members of staff to help you out. The latter are essential, as over time the restaurant gets busier; once you open the restaurant, you control Dave as he serves dishes and maintains the restaurant, and hiring extra hands to help is key to success. Whether it&#8217;s pouring drinks, dashing around to serve sushi plates, cleaning up, or keeping Bancho well-stocked with sushi, this is a frenetic <em>Overcooked</em>-style part of the game that contrasts well with the diving. It&#8217;s certainly not as layered as the underwater gameplay, but it&#8217;s not supposed to be, and does a successful job at giving the player a break between each dive. Plus, it&#8217;s extremely satisfying to see the profits come in &#8211; which can then be spent on upgrades the next day, when the cycle begins anew&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Just Keep Swimming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this core gameplay loop, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> steadily introduces new characters and locations throughout the seven main story chapters. They&#8217;re an eclectic bunch, each with their own expertise and side quests. Archaeologist Dr. Bacon propels the main story forward; as you dive deeper, you discover much more than just fish, including secret civilizations and bigger ecological threats to the Blue Hole &#8211; the latter of which is tracked by the biologist Ellie, who gives you various collection tasks through the Ecowatcher app. Speaking of which, your progress is mostly tracked via these apps, which are accessed via the efficient menu on Dave&#8217;s smartphone. To give a few examples: you might use the phone to acquire and upgrade weapons (with the help of the aforementioned Duff); you might browse your snaps for photographer Udo; or you might look through your Pokémon-style Marinca collection for Sato, an Ash Ketchum lookalike!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15146" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15153" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15154" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between all these characters and side quests, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> has something for everyone. If you like collecting then you can focus on filling out the Marinca (essentially a Pokédex for fish), if you like the sushi-management side you can focus on optimising your earnings, and if you like exploring then you can focus on the diving. Whichever way you play, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> smartly manages to naturally push the story on regardless &#8211; for example, a character named Otto opens a farm partway into the game, where you can grow crops such as rice. Growing these ingredients helps you to reliably create more valuable dishes in the evening; but to help out Otto and subsequently build up the farm, you need to collect certain items, which requires becoming proficient at the diving. Each element of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> gently motivates the others in this way, and therefore pushes the player to test out every facet of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a side effect of this admirable gameplay variety is that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> occasionally inserts under-baked minigames or quick time events. One instance of this is the cooking competition side missions, where you must gather ingredients for Bancho as you normally would, but upon doing so, you must then engage in first-person cooking challenges. These consist of basic button presses and directional inputs, and feel like a rushed version of either a <em>Cooking Mama</em> or <em>Mario Party</em> minigame. It was the rare moment in <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> where I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15123" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15124" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15127" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15136" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, some of these asides work better than others &#8211; a relatively quick soldering minigame is an enjoyable and brief inclusion, and there&#8217;s a compelling <em>Balatro</em>-style card game, but on the other hand, a one-time stealth sequence is particularly badly designed. These hiccups are rare enough that they don&#8217;t significantly detract from <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, but they were also noticeable enough that I had to mention them in this review. They just feel unnecessary &#8211; it&#8217;s as if <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> felt it had to extend itself beyond the main gameplay loop that it executes so superbly. If anything, the high quality of the core diving-and-sushi-selling gameplay only make the brief diversions more jarring.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Deadly Depths</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the various other side missions and gameplay mechanics, it&#8217;s the diving that&#8217;s understandably the focus of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, and it&#8217;s exceptionally well-balanced. As aforementioned, your initial harpoon is a unique weapon to master &#8211; but Dave can also carry one firearm, either by collecting them underwater or by crafting them beforehand. There&#8217;s a range of weapon types: you might use the Net Gun for catching large swathes of fish, or perhaps the Grenade Launcher for explosive damage, or even (my weapon of choice) the Sniper Rifle for long-range damage. The latter is especially handy when tackling sea life that is aggressive at close range, such as the many sharks patrolling the Blue Hole!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15161" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Dave isn&#8217;t just reeling in small fish. You&#8217;ll soon be fighting not only sharks, but hostile jellyfish, giant squids, and plenty more! Significant story events are often accompanied by a boss fight against a dangerous opponent such as these, introduced with stylish freeze frames reminiscent of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and signifying the stakes of the encounter. Additionally, new areas of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> can be a trial by fire, with enemies that suddenly reduce huge amounts of your oxygen supply (which doubles as a health bar of sorts) with a single hit. However, the challenge rarely felt unfair, and any failed dives were always down to my own mistakes &#8211; and only left me more motivated to improve my aquatic skills or upgrade my gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, as well as your harpoon and firearm, Dave can carry a melee weapon (also used for mining materials) and two pieces of equipment. The latter of these can vary, from battle items such as a proximity mine, to ways of helping Dave in a pinch, such as portable oxygen refills. Most of these can be found underwater, or alternatively, they can be pre-purchased from Cobra in the boat before starting your dive, adding another way for the player to customise their approach. Overall, there&#8217;s a well-judged balance between giving the player plenty of options, but not giving you so much power that you can become complacent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15142" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15172" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15168" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when you feel comfortable with Dave and his toolset, the missions being asked of you often cleverly push you out of your comfort zone &#8211; and if you&#8217;re not careful, it doesn&#8217;t take much for a dangerous enemy or perilous area to derail your dive and leave you back at the boat almost empty-handed. It&#8217;s oh-so-easy to fall into the trap of completing just one more mission, collecting just one more item, capturing just one more fish &#8211; but equally, there&#8217;s an undeniable thrill to escaping just in time. In the later chapters, missions become more specific to match your increased skills, and particular ingredients can necessitate repeated captures of rare creatures. This cycle reminded me of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and similarly to that series, provides a tangible reason to keep capturing the most elusive fish &#8211; in this case, to find the rarest ingredients and compose the finest dishes at Bancho Sushi!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Under the Sea</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the endearing yet adventurous nature of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the graphical style; the gorgeous pixel-art invites you in, making diving a little deeper &#8211; and playing a little longer &#8211; even more enticing. The shallow regions are full of bright welcoming colours, but the variety only builds from here. Every layer under the water has a unique visual identity, such as the dark Blue Hole Depths, or the extreme cold and heat of later areas. Meanwhile, night-time dives feature a shining kaleidoscope of colourful foliage that feels magical to navigate &#8211; when you&#8217;re not being pursued by deadly fish, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15162" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the human character designs have a palpable sense of personality. This gets more spotlight in the earlier-mentioned animated cutscenes, which blend the stunning pixel art with the tongue-in-cheek humour that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> does so well. By the end of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, the roster of characters have a real sense of camaraderie between them, which contributes to that overall warm and relaxed feeling that the game has. Add in the detailed multitude of marine species and food recipes, and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> really is a delectably beautiful game. Playing it on the large handheld screen <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/09/09/did-my-hopes-for-the-switch-2-become-a-reality/">of the Switch 2</a> has only accentuated this feeling further for me &#8211; and it&#8217;s been a great example for how that console helps the back catalogue of the original Switch to shine even brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial compliment to the visuals of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the music, which is often a wonderfully soothing backdrop to your deep sea exploration. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a notably therapeutic game when you’re just casually collecting fish, exploring the vast swathes of water, and listening to the delicate musical backdrop. My favourite piece of music is for a late-game frozen area, where these tranquil tones morph into a synth-style inspirational beat. Also, music fans will get an extra treat from a certain cameo appearance at Bancho Sushi, who comes complete with a musical performance that I’ve been listening to many times since! Not to be glossed over is the sound design, too &#8211; the sounds of marine life, the tense pull of a harpoon, the whooshing of waves, it all sounds authentic and distinct, and pulls you further into the watery world of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15163" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15148" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg?w=863" width="863" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15150" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing about this game &#8211; it reels you in, not necessarily in a sudden way, but a gradual one. As the in-game days go by, you settle more thoroughly into the gameplay loop, getting more familiar with characters old and new, until they become familiar friends on your adventure. There&#8217;s a sense of pleasing routine to checking your farms for crops and ingredients, then going diving and completing missions, before then preparing for the evening Bancho Sushi business. It&#8217;s a lot like the charm of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> or <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but with the added element of gripping underwater gameplay to go alongside it. The game is kept fresh by the steady incline of options and equipment available to Dave, and this creates an endgame with potentially endless longevity. Even when you finish all of the main story missions, you still have a restaurant business to run, and you can continue building it out to your hearts content. There&#8217;s extra DLC too, two of which (the <em>Dredge</em> and <em>Godzilla</em> tie-in packs) are free, for those looking for extra content!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a delight to play through <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. The mix of gripping gameplay and relaxing sushi simulation &#8211; combined with the incredible art direction and music &#8211; makes for an RPG full of endearing charm and well-meaning adventure. At its heart is whimsy and a sense of positivity, and that soaks through into every part of the game &#8211; and each part compliments the other in a wonderfully natural way. My only criticism is that this enthusiasm leads to the introduction of impromptu minigames and quick time events that sometimes feel underdeveloped in contrast to the main diving gameplay &#8211; but they&#8217;re few and far between, and a drop in the ocean compared to the sea of brilliance within <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. There&#8217;s brilliant longevity built in too &#8211; even after finishing the main story, the diving and sushi restaurant aspects remain, for those who&#8217;d like to continue building Bancho Sushi into the best restaurant it can be. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a treasure of a game, and it comes highly recommended from me!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center

This particular Direct was split into three distinct segments: first about the 40th Anniversary of Mario, then news for the original Nintendo Switch, and then finally information on the Switch 2 &#8211; and altogether it made for a barnstorming hour-long performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo has been on a run of brilliant Directs over the last few years, but this might genuinely be my favourite one for a long while. Many of the announcements in this Direct speak specifically to me and the games I have been looking forward to, and it&#8217;s genuinely made whittling my choices down to five a tough task! If you&#8217;d like to see the full Nintendo Direct, you can do so below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Honourable Mentions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of it being a tough task&#8230; With so much packed into the Direct, I am first going to run through some other announcements that I was glad or intrigued to see, but didn&#8217;t make the cut for the five announcements that appealed most to me personally. The Nintendo Direct started with several <em>Mario </em>announcements in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary: this included a trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> in 2026, as well as a collection of both <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> games for Nintendo Switch, coming October 2nd this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retrospectively, this does make <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/04/lets-chat-3d-mario-games-are-coming-to-switch-but-where-is-galaxy-2/">the decision not to include <em>Galaxy 2</em> in the <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> collection</a> feel very calculated. I personally will likely pass on this new release of the <em>Galaxy </em>games, as the £58.99 cost (or £33.99 separately) feels excessive &#8211; and whilst they are superb games, I doubt I&#8217;ll play them enough when there are so many other new games to play. I do, however, hope to get the physical <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOor7cl-qF_B_yaH1ketH1_ep2UqAIeMsULytGxbXaJ-8c79YpmKe">Rosalina&#8217;s Storybook</a> they are making, as that would be lovely to keep in the collection!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15028" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15029" height="377" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg?w=670" width="670" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15027" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15026" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we got a release date of 4th December for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was great to have confirmed &#8211; and the only reason it isn&#8217;t in my main five picks below is that the new footage left me a bit hesitant. We got to see the new bike Samus will use to traverse the world, and there was something off about it &#8211; the world looked a bit too empty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The footage reminded me of the infamous Mako in the first <em>Mass Effect</em> game, which was also known for wide open spaces that felt empty and were awkward to navigate. Visually, the bike is very cool, and the first-person segments look fantastic, but I was surprised at the briefness of this new footage. I sincerely hope that isn&#8217;t a sign of a lack of confidence in the game; either way, eight years after the initial announcement, I remain very excited for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> to finally launch!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I&#8217;d like to give a mention to the <em>Pokémon</em> segment of the Direct. We got the announcement of a brand new spin-off game named <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, which looks like a mix between<em> Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>, where you play as a Ditto-turned-human (whether this is charming or horrific, you decide)! This game probably won&#8217;t be for me, but I envisage it being very popular, by blending life-sim mechanics with the popularity of the world of <em>Pokémon</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, we got more info for the soon-to-be-released <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, showing off new Mega Evolutions; this segment ended with an announcement of the upcoming <em>Mega Dimension</em> paid DLC, and this felt quite cynical &#8211; it feels strange to have paid DLC announced before we even have the base game. I&#8217;ll wait and see how that DLC materialises, but for now, I&#8217;m fine not seeing much more about <em>Z-A</em>, as I&#8217;m definitely purchasing the game at launch. From here, the Direct transitioned into the surprise announcement of <em>Danganronpa 2&#215;2</em>, a new version of <em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> with added content! I only relatively recently finished (<a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/09/danganronpa-2-goodbye-despair-review-an-ambitious-beautiful-mess-of-a-sequel/">and reviewed</a>) the original game on Switch, and I really enjoyed it overall, so I&#8217;ll be curious to see how much difference the additions make.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15020" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15024" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15025" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15022" height="338" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg?w=600" width="600" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That was quite a long honourable mentions section, wasn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a result of just how many exciting announcements we received; I finished this Direct feeling very optimistic about the future of the Switch 2, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten into my top five reason why! When there are so many announcements, writing this sort of article helps me process the Direct and focus in on the games I&#8217;m going to prioritise playing, and I hope it is an enjoyable read for you too! Right, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#5: Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the most exciting part of the <em>Mario </em>section of the Direct was the announcement of a brand new Yoshi game, named <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em>! Yoshi side-scrollers have a reputation for charming art directions &#8211; for example <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Woolly World</em> and <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Crafted World</em> &#8211; and this game continues that, with a gorgeous stop-motion visual style bursting with colour and personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot of the game follows Yoshi after the appearance of a peculiar book named Mr. E, with pages detailing mysterious creatures. Yoshi jumps into the book (which is the reason for the storybook graphical style) and meets various new creatures, with the details jotted down into the book as Yoshi does so. Completing the storybook of fantastical creatures is an accompaniment to the charming platforming, and there&#8217;s a palpable sense of warmth and whimsy to it all. This game looks ideal for playing on a rainy weekend, wrapped up warm and enjoying the cosy gameplay. I see <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>being a brilliant experience for all ages of players, and I look forward to playing it myself when it releases in Spring 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#4: Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Direct contained the announcements of release dates for several high-profile previously-announced games, and three of these appear on my list. Starting this off is <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>, the third <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> game after the original and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/05/15/my-to-play-list-may-2023-progress/">Age of Calamity</a></em>, which is confirmed to release on November 6th. Just as the latter of those filled in story gaps for <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, one of the main appeals of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is adding story details for <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. Specifically, the time period that Princess Zelda is sent back to in that game &#8211; and I&#8217;m glad to see this time covered more thoroughly, as it felt to me that Zelda was unfairly side-lined in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as a release date, the new footage showed off playable characters such as Queen Sonia, King Rauru, and a new unnamed Korok character. The gameplay looks like the expected <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-esque combat, but there are some additions, such as Zonai devices and multi-character Sync Strikes that change depending on the character combinations. There&#8217;s also the confirmation of local GameShare multiplayer and splitscreen, and glimpses of many epic visual sequences such as airborne Gleeok battles. I accept that the gameplay will likely be repetitive, but for me the appeal of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games is the visual spectacle and extra lore &#8211; and<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> looks to be delivering on that!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#3: Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the brand new announcements of the Direct was that of a new mainline <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, named <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em>. It&#8217;s been wonderful to see <em>Fire Emblem</em> gradually become a household name in the West, with the 3DS games such as <em>Awakening</em> laying the groundwork for <em>Three Houses</em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/14/a-little-zelda-a-lotta-farming-takeaways-from-the-nintendo-direct/">Engage</a> </em>to be massive hits on Switch. The distinction setting <em>Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart is the gladiator-style Heroic Games, which has a multitude of characters competing for the fulfilled wishes that supposedly reward your victory. At the end of the trailer, we see a tease of Sothis, a character from Three Houses &#8211; so it appears there may be a story connection to that game as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the game looks stunning, with gorgeous anime visuals, and clean turn-based strategy UI design. Part of the appeal of <em>Fire Emblem</em> is the stakes of building character relationships in a world where permadeath is possible, and the gladiatorial setting will hopefully provide a fresh twist to that structure that will set<em> Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart. The trailer has a variety of striking characters, and I&#8217;m looking forward to finding my favourites! For now, we only have a general 2026 release date, so I&#8217;d guess that this game will be one of the major late-year releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#2: Resident Evil: Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think it surprising that I&#8217;ve put two already-announced games above the news of a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game; but that&#8217;s a reflection of my adoration for the franchises these next two games are a part of, and how stoked I am to see additional news about their next instalments. Firstly we have <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, the much-anticipated ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> game (if you don&#8217;t count <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/27/resident-evil-zero-review/"><em>Resident Evil Zero</em></a>). This latest entry stars FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she pursues the truth about a deadly virus and the mystery of her mother&#8217;s death &#8211; a path which leads her to the ruins of Raccoon City. This game had already been announced for other consoles, but this is the formal announcement of a Switch 2 version, which is brilliant to see. On Switch, <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/11/25/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/16/resident-evil-village-review/">Resident Evil Village</a></em> could only be played as Cloud games, but the more conventional release of <em>Requiem </em>shows that the console can (for now, at least) keep up with modern large-scale third-party releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually might play <em>Requiem </em>on Switch 2 &#8211; my only other means would be PC or Xbox Series S, and as someone who likes to collect physical copies of <em>Resident Evil</em> games on console, that makes the Switch 2 version more appealing to me. <em>Requiem </em>is up there as one of my most anticipated games; I adore the <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise, and am eagerly awaiting <em>Requiem</em> to see how they interweave the lore of the series into the story. Other than Chris Redfield, we haven&#8217;t had any of the earlier characters show up in the main series since <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, and with the return to Raccoon City, this feels like an ideal time for some guest appearances of older, more experienced versions of those fan favourites. Grace Ashcroft is also the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character from the lesser-known spin-off <em>Resident Evil Outbreak</em> games, which already shows that Capcom is happy playing with some deep-cut lore. I happen to have bought the two <em>Outbreak</em> games second-hand before <em>Requiem</em> was even announced, and am planning to play them before the launch of <em>Requiem </em>and write up my thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Requiem </em>trailer in the Direct was full of intense visuals, threatening figures, and story hints (such as the iconic Umbrella Corporation logo). It struck me that there&#8217;s an underlying grungy tone waiting to break out, which I&#8217;m very excited to discover. This can even be seen in the logo for <em>Requiem</em>, and the burned-out profile shot of Grace near the end of this new trailer. Right now, the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise is in a very healthy place (as healthy a a series about viral monstrosities can be, anyway), and it&#8217;s given Capcom a resulting confidence that could make this game utterly exceptional. They&#8217;re playing their cards close to their chest, concealing the full extent of the horrors that await us on February 27th&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#1: Hades II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yes, oh yes. This is an announcement fans of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/14/hades-review/">Hades</a></em> and Supergiant Games have been awaiting since the reveal of <em>Hades II</em> back at The Game Awards in 2022, and now it&#8217;s here &#8211; the release date of the official 1.0 version, releasing digitally on Switch and PC on September 25th (and physically on November 20th). The first <em>Hades</em> is a phenomenal roguelike action game that turned many players into fans of the genre, but it was quite a surprise when Supergiant announced a sequel &#8211; not only was the first game utterly jam-packed with content and ideas, but they&#8217;d never done a sequel game before. I&#8217;ve purposefully been avoiding details about the game in Early Access, as I&#8217;d like to go in fresh and see what marvels Supergiant have cooked up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon this could be a <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>/<em>Galaxy 2</em> situation, where the developers have so many ideas and so much creativity to share, that they need a whole other game to fit it all in. This time, we play as the immortal Princess of the Underworld, battling against the Titan of Time and exploring an even larger and deeper mythic world of Olympian Gods. In the Direct, this was visualized with a cutscene that gave me goosebumps from the visual flair on show; Supergiant are known for their sumptuous visuals and music, and that&#8217;s very much still the case here. I&#8217;m eager to dive back into the rich gameplay and gripping story of the world of <em>Hades</em>, reuniting with previous characters (Artemis is back!) and meeting new ones. I honestly didn&#8217;t expect the release date to be so soon, but in less than two weeks we&#8217;ll be able to play the 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> &#8211; discovering new Boons, enemies, locations, and more. Bring it on!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>This Nintendo Direct was sensational, and answered many questions about release dates and upcoming games for the Switch 2 (and Switch) release slate. I&#8217;ve been enjoying my gaming a lot recently, and this Direct has only fuelled that passion more &#8211; the only problem is going to be finding the time to play all these games!

It&#8217;s been roughly a year and a half since I wrote that post, and the Switch 2 has been out for just over three months &#8211; so we now have comprehensive knowledge of what the system offers. With the Switch 2, Nintendo took the wise (and safe) approach, capitalising on the continued popularity of the Switch brand and not changing things too drastically. The console is more of an iteration rather than a revolution, but it certainly makes significant changes and upgrades in certain areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had some time with the Switch 2, I thought it&#8217;d be a suitable moment to take a look back at my aforementioned post about my hopes for the console, run one-by-one through the list, and talk about which became a reality (and which didn&#8217;t). Then, at the end of the post, I&#8217;ll summarise my current personal opinions on the Switch 2, taking these results into account. Right then, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Optimize the eShop: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My foremost request was to improve the eShop, which was struggling on multiple fronts on the original Switch: the sheer volume of releases made discoverability of games difficult; there was a lack of quality control; and the user interface was susceptible to noticeable lag. In my opinion, this was one of the most important areas for Nintendo to improve upon &#8211; it might seem less flashy than other aspects, but improving the process of finding new digital games is an underrated key aspect of a modern console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To start on a positive note, I&#8217;m pleased with the way Nintendo has improved the responsiveness of the eShop. I immediately noticed how much quicker and easier it is to navigate the store &#8211; gone are the painful moments waiting for the eShop to catch up with your inputs. Whether this is down to the increased hardware power, general eShop optimisation, or both, it improves the experience of browsing through the available games, and encourages curiosity as a result. In my book, that boost to game discoverability is a win for both the player and the developers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, whilst Nintendo has bolstered the options on the eShop main menu, it&#8217;s not as extensively as I&#8217;d hoped. Most of the options &#8211; such as the Search, Current Offers, and Coming Soon &#8211; are the same, and the only brand new addition is the For You tab, which recommends games based on your own gameplay trends. I was really hoping for some other additions, or even a review system so that players could help to recommend games for others. As it is, the eShop still has the problem of a constant inundation of new games &#8211; and whilst the Popular New Releases sub-section is a step in the right direction, any game that doesn&#8217;t qualify for this (or the Highlights tab) will get very limited time to grab player attention before the spotlight is taken by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14942" height="645" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14940" height="639" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14938" height="624" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14941" height="598" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of quality control, I reserve full judgement until more time has passed, but it seems that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t changed their approach. Lots of cheap-looking games are still flooding the eShop, and there are still Hentai games appearing relatively frequently. From my perspective, Nintendo could still do with raising the bar of entry, in order to curate a higher level of overall quality across the eShop. The current influx of these low-quality games worsens the issue of discoverability for other titles, which get mired amidst them despite taking much more time and effort to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the steps I&#8217;d still like to see taken for more eShop filtering options and better quality control, Nintendo has still significantly improved the eShop, especially in terms of responsiveness. Therefore, I mark this section as a success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More Power: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is that age-old request for new consoles &#8211; that they have more power, and are able to present games in higher framerates and resolutions. Since the Wii/DS era, Nintendo has rarely (if ever) been known as the technical powerhouse, with art direction, creative hardware, and recognizable IP being more important for bringing in players. That said, the Switch 2 is a big step up from the original Switch, with Nvidia claiming that it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nvidia-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">&#8220;10 times the graphical performance&#8221;</a> of the previous console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a technical expert, so I look for comparisons to other consoles to get a handle on where the Switch 2 lands power-wise. The general perception seems to be that at peak performance, docked on a TV, the Switch 2 is comparable to a PlayStation 4 Pro, but still behind the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles &#8211; which essentially matches my prediction back in March 2024. When played in handheld mode, the system is closer to a base PlayStation 4, but that is compensated for by the smaller screen, which often makes games look crisper to the eye (at least for me).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a hybrid system with a handheld option, battery life is another crucial factor to consider, and the increased performance does appear to have hurt the Switch 2 in this area. You generally get around two-three hours when playing any sort of intensive game, which can feel quite short. However, most of the time I don&#8217;t see this being an issue, unless I am on a very long journey &#8211; and it&#8217;s rare not to have a nearby place to plug in and charge. Whilst that isn&#8217;t an excuse, I prefer Nintendo providing stronger hardware and a shorter battery life rather than the opposite, so I&#8217;m still satisfied on this front. For example, I&#8217;m playing <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/09/17/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-14-09-23/">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em> at the moment, and occasionally having to charge the console is a small price to pay for how well it plays and looks in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14949" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14946" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14947" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14948" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When playing in handheld mode, the screen really is stunning; the increased size and power makes games look incredible, and it makes playing in bed (or wherever you prefer) feel like a luxury. The vibrancy and sharpness of the screen &#8211; especially when held close up for handheld gaming &#8211; gave me that new-generation-upgrade feeling that I was looking for. I&#8217;ve heard some disappointment that Nintendo didn&#8217;t use an OLED screen, but in my opinion the LCD screen is more than sufficient, and if it helps keep costs down then that&#8217;s a reasonable trade. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll get an OLED version of the Switch 2 (like for the original Switch) at some point too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only Switch 2-exclusive game I&#8217;ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em> (you can <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/10/mario-kart-world-review-a-stunning-racer-that-misses-a-few-tricks/">read my review here</a>), and as well as being a fantastic game, it doubles as an excellent technical showcase for the Switch 2. Played in 4K HDR on my TV, it looks sensational. The game moves with a crisp fluidity, and the environment feels palpably full of detail and colour. It was upon playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> that it really dawned on me that the Switch 2 was a major &#8211; and timely &#8211; graphical update on its predecessor, allowing it to keep fair pace with the technical state of gaming.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14934" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>All that graphical performance is needed to do justice to the beauty of Cow</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>All in all, whilst my test case for the Switch 2 is relatively limited for now (I haven&#8217;t played upgraded Switch games like <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em> yet either), I&#8217;m confident that the Switch 2 has delivered on the level of power I personally need in a Nintendo console. I don&#8217;t need it to be top-of-the-range; as long as the system is powerful enough to realise the trademark visual flair of first-party Nintendo games, and is able to house a strong line-up of new third-party releases, then that&#8217;s plenty for me. I eagerly await seeing what Nintendo can magic up with their bespoke Switch 2 games in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Clarity on Games: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads nicely into my next point, on the topic of the Switch 2 software line-up now and into the future. A console is defined by the games on it &#8211; and there were two particular games I was waiting for news on when I wrote that original post in March 2024. These were <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> and also the next Nintendo EAD game, which I predicted would be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game in the vein of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. We have received news on both of these games, even if the latter wasn&#8217;t quite the game I expected, as it has instead materialised as <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14932" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I am loving the vibrant purples in this art, by the way</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about <em>Metroid</em>. The development path of the long-awaited <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> has been turbulent, to say the least &#8211; after being announced back in 2017, Nintendo then publicly announced that they were restarting development in 2019, with Retro Studios (the developers of the original <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em>) coming back on board. When I wrote my post about my hopes for the Switch 2, we were still awaiting news on Metroid &#8211; but roughly three months later <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/06/19/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-18-06-2024/">in the June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, Nintendo finally showed us an announcement trailer for the newly-titled <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That initial trailer gave us a taste of the returning first-person <em>Metroid</em> gameplay and a glimpse of returning enemy Sylux, which kept fans occupied until February 2025, when it was announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM&amp;t=1631s">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> that <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> would be a cross-generation title on both Switch and Switch 2. Whilst unsurprising, this was welcome news &#8211; and roughly a month later in March, we got another Nintendo Direct trailer (see below), showing off more of the game and giving us a 2025 release date. This was followed up by an extensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9xes7BZto">Nintendo Treehouse video</a> in April, continuing the steady stream of new information on the game. However, as we enter September, we&#8217;re awaiting news on a precise release date, and I hope we hear more soon. Even if the game has to be pushed into 2026, I wouldn&#8217;t mind &#8211; after so long waiting, I&#8217;d prefer to wait a little longer if it means a better experience. What&#8217;s another few months after eight years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be fascinating to see the comparison between the Switch 2 and Switch editions of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>; the enhanced Switch 2 edition will have Joy-Con 2 mouse controls as well as support for 4K, HDR, and 120 fps! After seeing how brilliant <em>Mario Kart World</em> looks, I&#8217;m excited to experience a new <em>Metroid</em> adventure in these formats &#8211; I have a feeling the game will look sensational. So far, it appears that the game isn&#8217;t straying too far from the gameplay of previous <em>Prime </em>games, and instead refining the first-person formula, with some added tricks such as Psychic Abilities for Samus. I&#8217;m especially intrigued to see where the story goes, and am avoiding too many plot details until release!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, I thought <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was the more outlandish of the two games I was anticipating back in March 2024, as I was confident that a new 3D <em>Mario </em>from Nintendo EAD would be announced. I was both right and wrong &#8211; whilst we haven&#8217;t received a 3D <em>Mario </em>per se, we have gotten a new <em>Mario</em>-adjacent Nintendo EAD 3D game, in the form of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! This was the closing reveal in the Switch 2 Direct back in April; but it wasn&#8217;t until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Direct</a> in June that it was announced this isn&#8217;t just a Donkey Kong game, but a Pauline game as well, with a younger version of the character joining DK on his travels!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo EAD have an amazing track record, and the glowing critical reception to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>has been a continuation of this, praising the sheer gameplay creativity and enjoyment. One of the key features is the ability for Donkey Kong to smash through the environment, reshaping and even creating tunnels through it! The game released on 17th July, and I haven&#8217;t actually played it yet, as I haven&#8217;t found the time to justify spending the money on it. But now <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/">that I&#8217;ve finished the Pokémon League in <em>Pokémon Diamond</em></a> and am taking a break from that, I&#8217;ll hopefully soon get around to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, my next definite Switch 2 purchase will be <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, and I&#8217;m very tempted to get <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> too! There&#8217;s also the question about how series such as <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/10/25/where-can-zelda-go-after-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> might manifest on Switch 2, but I&#8217;m happy having patience &#8211; there are already so many other amazing games to play in the meantime!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More System Customization: No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, here we come to the first of my hopes that didn&#8217;t become a reality. The original Switch only allowed very simple customisation of the Home screen, and Switch 2 hasn&#8217;t evolved this at all, still only allowing two Themes: Basic White and Basic Black (my console is set to the latter). Having a Themes menu suggests the idea of having more options, but I&#8217;m not full of confidence, as we haven&#8217;t received any extra options since the original Switch launch in 2017.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14926" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I like neutral colours, but the option to add more flair could be fun</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not a software developer, it feels like Nintendo is missing an open goal by not allowing us to have Themes based on franchises such as <em>Mario</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, or <em>Metroid</em> &#8211; I honestly think people would even spend a small amount on these, in order to add vibrant new visuals to their systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that Nintendo could still add options in the future, but it&#8217;s disappointing that for now there&#8217;s no word on this. In my March 2024 post, I suggested extra options such as the <em>Nintendo Badge Arcade</em> sticker system on 3DS, but now I feel as if I need to keep expectations in check. At this point, even a couple extra Themes would be great to see.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14928" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Themes menu even seems designed to hold more options</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As on the original Switch, the main way of showing personality is through your profile icon. Nintendo has added extra customisation options over time, particularly via the Nintendo Switch Online menu, where you can unlock new characters, backgrounds, and frames for your profile icon. Whilst it&#8217;s a mostly unchanged process from the Switch, I&#8217;m glad this bit of customisation is still present. I imagine it won&#8217;t be too long until we get more Joy-Con 2 colours, so at least there should soon be that avenue for customising the look of your console (if you have the expendable income). Considering how popular the Switch 2 is, it&#8217;d be wonderful to see more done on the digital side to allow players to show their personality. I hope we see developments in this area in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Enhanced Social Features: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth and final entry on this list regards the social aspects of the Switch &#8211; in my original post, this was primarily about having improved voice chat functions, and thankfully, this is the main social aspect where the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade! After years (and multiple console generations) of players asking, Nintendo has finally added an in-built party voice chat to the Switch 2, named GameChat. It&#8217;s now possible to talk to your registered friends over the internet, using the in-built microphone in the Switch (and Camera, if purchased), even if they are playing different software. Whilst it isn&#8217;t revolutionary &#8211; after all, other consoles have had similar systems for a long time &#8211; it&#8217;s a welcome addition that I&#8217;m very happy to see Nintendo include for the Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous Nintendo consoles have had forms of voice chat, but they always had some sort of catch &#8211; for example on the Switch, where voice chat was tied to the Switch Online mobile app. So, it&#8217;s great to see Nintendo introduce a more complete and in-built offering &#8211; if anything, I feel a bit bad, because I doubt I&#8217;ll use it much. As the years have passed, I&#8217;ve gotten used to using Discord as an alternative form of online chat when playing Nintendo games, because it&#8217;s been more convenient &#8211; and I think it&#8217;ll be hard to break out of that routine. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m very glad GameChat has been added for the Switch 2, and I commend Nintendo for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I hoped to see some sort of extensive social hub added, along the lines of Miiverse or StreetPass. The closest is the Nintendo Switch App, which has new functionality such as uploading screenshots, receiving GameChat notifications, and (most intriguingly) interacting with games such as <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (see the images below). But I miss the in-built communal aspects of previous systems, as they brought people together without as much push towards a mobile app. We still have the News channels to get specific updates on the topics and games you choose to follow, but these are mostly one-way interactions. Nintendo has done well in previous generations at creating unique spaces for players to help shape the multiplayer culture of their consoles, but Switch and Switch 2 feel a bit more controlled in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14922" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14921" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14923" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another aspect that the Switch 2 still lacks is an equivalent to Achievements or Trophies. This is something I used to think was a glaring omission, as it would be a great extra motivation to 100% games such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/04/30/lets-chat-a-long-overdue-super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>. But <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/16/why-ive-stopped-caring-so-much-about-achievements-trophies/">as years have gone by</a>, I have gained respect for Nintendo not having this sort of system, whether it be by conscious decision or simply a lack of intention to do so. There&#8217;s something freeing about playing games on the Switch, and indeed, the Switch 2 &#8211; there&#8217;s a lack of TV/streaming apps, or completion-style Achievement/Trophy systems, and instead the focus is all on the act of playing games. That laser-focus is really refreshing, and I&#8217;m not clamouring for those additions at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, whilst I&#8217;d like to see an expansion into a more communal gaming hub in the future, the Switch 2 definitely delivered on my hope for enhanced social features. The addition of GameChat is one of the major upgrades for the Switch 2, and a lot of marketing and development focus went into it, which shows Nintendo listened to player requests for this type of addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After going through those five points, how has the Switch 2 fared when it comes to my personal hopes for the console? Four of my five points were met to some degree of success, which I mark as a win overall. Evidently, Nintendo recognised the general areas where improvements could be made &#8211; and whilst not all of them were as emphatic an upgrade as I may have hoped, the cumulative progress makes for a significant leap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarise, I&#8217;m going to rattle back through the main points. Firstly, the eShop is much easier and faster to navigate, but could still do with more options for filters and user reviews. In addition, the console is a step up in power, and whilst it isn&#8217;t at the level of modern Microsoft and Sony consoles, games look brilliant and the hardware keeps Nintendo in the ballpark for third-party games. Speaking of which, we have received welcome news on <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, and seen the release of a new exciting Nintendo EAD game in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, and now we wait for the likes of <em>Pokémon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and other franchises to launch on the console. Sadly, Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added much in the way of system customization, but it has delivered new social options in the form of GameChat, finally bringing in-built party chat to a Nintendo console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the admitted caveats to some of the &#8220;Yes&#8221; points, I want to focus on the positives of the Switch 2. This is because, despite the iterative nature of the console, it does achieve that new-console feel. I was worried that it might feel like another specification of Switch instead of a brand new thing, but there are enough upgrades to ensure that isn&#8217;t the case. Much of this is down to the optimized power of the console, and how much snappier and responsive it is to play. But another contributing factor is the hardware itself &#8211; in handheld mode, the larger form factor and sleeker Joy-Con 2 designs feels fresh and streamlined, and the console has made playing in bed (for example) feel like a delightful high-end experience. I will say, it helps that I have massive hands, so the larger console size is more comfortable for me personally.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14952" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d like to see Nintendo continue to make software improvements to the Switch 2 &#8211; for example new eShop features, new menu Themes, and extra social hubs &#8211; but I&#8217;m left with a firmly positive impression of the console overall. I&#8217;ve been getting back into playing games more frequently recently, and I&#8217;m glad to say that the Switch 2 has been a contributing factor to that; and if I&#8217;m playing more games and having a good time doing so, that marks the Switch 2 as a success in my book!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this post!

As mentioned in that post, I was part-way through my first ever play through of <em>Diamond </em>at the time of writing. Of the two initial games (<em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>), <em>Pearl </em>was the one I got back in 2007, before then playing the third game <em>Platinum </em>when it released in 2009. I’ve kept my <em>Pearl </em>save to this day, whilst <em>Platinum </em>became the game I’d restart whenever I went back to play through Sinnoh &#8211; especially as it has extra content and various quality-of-life refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I hadn’t ever played <em>Diamond </em>until I felt compelled to buy myself a copy for £48.49 from GAME back in 2019. After all, <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>are second only to <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/07/11/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> in terms of my favourite games ever, so it’s lovely to have the complete set of three physical games. I’ve been gradually playing through <em>Diamond </em>ever since; in that aforementioned 2023 post, I noted that I’d reached the trek to Snowpoint City, roughly two-thirds of the way through the game. Since then, I&#8217;ve played a little bit more each year, finishing the villainous Team Galactic part of the main story, catching the cover Legendary Pokemon Dialga, and now preparing to tackle the Pokémon League!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-12 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14830" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14828" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14829" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14806" height="715" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve played through the Sinnoh-based <em>Pokémon</em> games, and the adventure feels a little different every time, for multiple reasons: , it might be the <em>Pokémon</em> team I choose, the approach I take, or how I’m feeling in my personal life at the time. With this being my first time playing <em>Diamond</em>, it&#8217;s felt unique once again &#8211; and as I gradually get ready to reach the end of the game (and start the postgame), I thought it’d be a nice point at which to write a journal-style post about the playthrough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, this journal approach matches my new writing method I’ve been testing, where I write a little bit every day, even if it’s just a paragraph or two. It’s helped me start posting at a more regular cadence recently, which I’ve really enjoyed, and am hoping to continue! I hope you’ll come with me on my retro-inspired ramble about my current adventuring in Sinnoh, and my plan to defeat the Pokémon League with a team that might be described as unconventional&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Shine Bright Like A&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this playthrough of <em>Diamond</em>, I decided not to create my character as “William”. I often style my avatar as myself on my first playthrough of a <em>Pokémon</em> game; but as I&#8217;ve played through Sinnoh many times before, I instead went for the approach I use on repeated playthroughs. In these situations, I like to create a new character persona, in a way that challenges my team selection, mixes up the gameplay, and allows me to add my own imaginary lore. Over the years, this has often led to me constructing a monotype team (usually Steel, my favourite type), but this time I went for a dichotomy theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14797" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14795" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The character I created is called Lucie, and I think of her as treading the line between both fiery and subdued personalities. Her starter is Chimchar, which will evolve into Infernape, one of the infamously few Fire type Pokémon in the core region of Sinnoh in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em> (the Elite Four member Flint has just two Fire types in their Fire-type team)! Two of the team slots are filled by a pair of Gastrodons (named Gianna and Gillian), a Pokémon which has two forms in Sinnoh: the pink West Sea Gastrodon, and the blue East Sea Gastrodon. By having one of each, it plays into that duality theming; I think of the pink Gastrodon as part of the &#8220;bright&#8221;, flamboyant side of the team, whilst the blue Gastrodon represents the &#8220;nocturnal&#8221;, subtler side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining the West Sea Gastrodon side of the team, we have the blazing Infernape (named Symphony), as well as Raichu (Ryland) and their electrifying moves. These Pokémon both deliver fast, strong damage: for example, Close Combat and Flare Blitz for Infernape, and Thunderbolt for Raichu. On the East Sea Gastrodon side is Noctowl (Miles), which has helpful status moves such as the sleep-inducing Hypnosis, as well as Skuntank (Skylah), which has Toxic for poisoning opponents and whittling them down. As you can probably tell, I&#8217;ve always liked to daydream up my own head canon for the characters and adventure. It helps every playthrough to feel unique, as if I&#8217;m adding extra world-building along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-14 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14793" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14791" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14787" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14788" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14790" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14789" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the team described above certainly isn&#8217;t the strongest possible for <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>&#8211; and I&#8217;m aware I&#8217;m making my life more difficult when it comes to battling the toughest trainers, such as the upcoming Elite Four and Champion Cynthia. But some of these Pokémon (especially Gastrodon, Nowtowl, and Skuntank) are Pokémon I&#8217;ve barely played with before, so I get to experience the challenge of Sinnoh in a brand new way! Mixing up the team helps every playthrough to feel fresh, and strengthens my personal connection with the team &#8211; not just now, but also when I look back on them years later, such as in a longevity app like <em>Pokémon HOME</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">A Girl&#8217;s Best Friend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;ve just finished working through Victory Road, reached the entrance to the Pokémon League, and completed the final fight against your in-game rival (on a whim, I named them Mervin). Relative to other games in the series, I&#8217;d argue that Sinnoh has the best Pokémon League &#8211; the members all have distinct personalities, and present a well-balanced challenge. The difficulty isn&#8217;t unfair, but requires you to take the League seriously; I&#8217;m currently in the phase of backtracking, training up the levels of my Pokémon, and refining the movesets, items, and strategies I&#8217;m going to approach the League with. With the team I&#8217;ve selected, it requires being very deliberate with my choices &#8211; of course, the main advantage I have is that I&#8217;m particularly familiar with the challenge that lies ahead, and can plan accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-15 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14817" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14811" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14821" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14820" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14818" height="168" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216" width="216" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14799" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sinnoh Pokémon League starts with the Bug-type trainer Aaron, who should be the easiest to defeat &#8211; Bug-types have many type weaknesses, such as to Fire and Flying, which my Infernape and Noctowl can target respectively. Next up will be Bertha and her Ground-type team, which will be a tougher test &#8211; the plethora of Ground attacks will be dangerous for Infernape and Raichu, so my two Gastrodons will be relied upon to use their Water-type moves. Noctowl has a useful immunity to Ground, and Skuntank can help out with Toxic, so my team has a decent amount of options for this battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is Flint, who as mentioned earlier, is a Fire-type trainer that curiously has three non-Fire types on their team. The two that are there &#8211; Rapidash and Infernape &#8211; should again struggle against the two Gastrodons, and then the rest of my team should be able to wear down Steelix, Drifblim, and Lopunny without too much issue. Then we&#8217;ll come to Lucian, the final member of the Elite Four, who has a Psychic-type team &#8211; and this is where Skuntank will have their turn taking centre stage, as their Dark typing makes them immune to Psychic moves. With the use of Night Slash (which has an elevated critical hit rate, boosted further by the equipped Razor Claw), Skuntank should carve through a lot of the opponents, with the help of Infernape to tackle the Steel typing of Bronzong.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-16 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14808" height="542" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721" width="721" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14810" height="548" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727" width="727" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing this plan out, it makes me fairly confident at defeating the Elite Four without too much trouble. However, players of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>know that the toughest challenge lies with Champion Cynthia and her excellent team of strong and varied Pokémon (which even includes a Gastrodon of her own)! The biggest threat is her ace Pokémon &#8211; Garchomp &#8211; which can likely take out most of my team with one hit from an Earthquake. My best options are going to be my two Gastrodons, which have strong defensive stats, and can use Blizzard and Ice Beam to hit the double Ice weakness of Garchomp. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll rely on Noctowl and Hypnosis, to give myself some more time. It&#8217;s going to be a nervy battle, but there are routes to success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">In Reflection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage of the game, where I&#8217;m backtracking and gradually training up my Pokémon, showcases some of why I adore <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>so much. In theory, this part could be tiresome, gradually grinding through the experience points needed to make my team stronger &#8211; but instead, I find it tranquil. There&#8217;s something magical about the way music, visuals, and gameplay combine in these games specifically, and I enjoy taking my time; one of the main places I&#8217;m training is Victory Road, as I can access a variety of strong wild Pokémon there. Near the entrance is a useful Pokémon Center for healing your team, and I often pause to listen to the &#8220;Pokémon League&#8221; music that plays outside it. This particular track has both &#8220;Day&#8221; and &#8220;Night&#8221; versions, and the latter is especially beautiful (you can listen below). It&#8217;s a beautifully delicate composition, and captures the feeling of being near the end of an amazing adventure, but with so much still left to enjoy, and no need to rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to this music is just one example of the catharsis I feel when playing <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, which is something I talked about back in my 2023 post. This sentiment comes from a place of both subjectivity and objectivity, as my emotional connection to these games is incredibly strong. After my older sister passed away in 2007, I spent hundreds of hours exploring Sinnoh, and I&#8217;m forever grateful to the soothing effect they had &#8211; and still have &#8211; on me. There are many positive aspects I associate with this: the meticulous sprite artwork and colour palette; the endearing Pokémon and character designs; the region full of secrets to explore; the sprawling Underground; and that amazing soundtrack, just to name a handful of reasons why I love these games so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I prepare to enter the Pokémon League, I&#8217;ve also started thinking about the postgame, which in <em>Diamond </em>includes a whole separate island northeast of Sinnoh, named the Battle Zone (see the map below). It includes the Fight Area, Resort Area, and Survival Area, plus Stark Mountain. The Fight Area includes the Battle Tower in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>, which is less extensive than the expanded Battle Frontier in <em>Platinum</em>, but still offers plenty of challenge and longevity. I love the sheer amount of space left to discover in the postgame; this island is like an extra enclosed region to explore. Currently, I&#8217;m undecided on whether I&#8217;ll dive straight into this after the Pokémon League, or take a break and come back at a later time.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14813" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I&#8217;m well acquainted with the celebratory feel of the Battle Zone island, and may well get drawn into playing it immediately! After the high of defeating the Pokémon League, it&#8217;s wonderful to realise there&#8217;s still so much left for your Pokémon and you to explore. The Battle Zone has a vacation vibe, especially as you initially take a ship to get there &#8211; and the music is also uplifting and energetic, for example Route 225, which feels like a burst of energy, complete with the iconic clapping (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQvx9STW1V0">go to 00:42 in this video</a>)! Overall, the Battle Zone has a celebratory feel, and adds a lot to the overall package of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. I&#8217;m excited for the character of Lucie to extend her adventure, and take her dual-themed team onwards and upwards!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Space and Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope with this post is that it shone a light on two things: the reasons that set this playthrough of <em>Diamond </em>apart, and more detail on why I have such a strong connection to <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. They are such special games to me personally, and for a long time, I&#8217;ve considered how to do that connection justice on this site. The 2023 post was a very cathartic one for me to write, and this post is an extension of that. It&#8217;s amazing how our personal circumstances can affect our thoughts on games (and other forms of media) &#8211; and I love hearing about these stories from other people too, as it often sparks positive discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14850" height="514" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827" width="827" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that down the line, I get to write another post about <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, talking about how the character of Lucie faced the Pokémon League, and then ventured into the postgame and Battle Zone. Down the line, I&#8217;ll likely inevitably play <em>Pokémon Platinum</em> again, and that&#8217;ll continue to be the game I go back to for replaying Sinnoh.

This is the first brand new <em>Mario Kart</em> on consoles since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> on Wii U back in 2014 (the Switch received an upgraded version, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, in 2017, which I skipped) &#8211; so at least for me personally, it&#8217;s felt a long time coming. Mixed in with the excitement of a brand new Nintendo console, it made the launch of <em>Mario Kart World</em> feel like a real event, especially when played with friends, which is where <em>Mario Kart</em> always excels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, in various different configurations: both on the TV and in handheld, in solo, local co-op, and online with a friend. Now, I&#8217;ve reached a point where I feel I can state a comprehensive opinion on the game, having experienced both the racing modes and the open world that&#8217;s a major selling point of this iteration of <em>Mario Kart</em>. My thoughts are overall very positive, but there are also some flawed aspects to the game  &#8211; but I&#8217;ll expand upon this more later on in the review. Without further ado then, let&#8217;s get into it!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Start Your Engines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it was the new-console glow, or perhaps it was that wait since <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, but launching into <em>Mario Kart World</em> for the first time felt distinctly special. The game encourages you straight into exploring the open world first; this consists of the various tracks connected by open spaces of road, field, water, desert, and more. What&#8217;s immediately remarkable about the game is just how gorgeous it looks, both in handheld but also especially when played on a 4K HDR TV &#8211; and whilst this isn&#8217;t new technology, it&#8217;s wonderful to play Nintendo games in such high fidelity via the Switch 2. The visual direction of <em>Mario Kart World</em> makes brilliant use of the new hardware, presenting a world full of vibrancy, colour, and personality &#8211; which is shown in the track designs, whether it&#8217;s the bustling Shy Guy Bazaar, the scrumptious Sky-High Sundae, or the fiery Bowser&#8217;s Castle, just to name three!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-17 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14727" height="574" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mkw_sgb_view.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14724" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14725" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_17.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The infused personality is evident in the roster of characters (complete with various different unlockable outfits). Returning are your usual suspects like Mario, Luigi, Peach, and so forth; additionally, there are plenty of newcomers, including minor enemies such as Konkdor and Cataquack, and even bit-part characters such as Dolphin and, of course, Cow! If you&#8217;ve seen any discourse about <em>Mario Kart World</em> since the initial announcement, you&#8217;ll know that the Cow and their adorable grin has captured the attention of the internet, and I&#8217;ve had a wonderful time watching the various memes and edits their inclusion has spawned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the characters have a range of changeable outfits too, which are unlocked by collecting Dash Food bags from vendors in races or the open world. It adds an extra way to differentiate the characters, ranging from punk rock biker looks to desert outfits and much more in between &#8211; and they can be combined with the plentiful different karts and bikes to create the aesthetic you&#8217;re looking for. A Photo Mode has been added in tandem with this, giving plentiful options for taking pictures that show off the world and characters as you see fit. Me being me, I&#8217;m sad that we got an Explorer outfit Toad but no actual Captain Toad&#8230; But there&#8217;s always time for that in DLC, hopefully!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14754" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A smorgasbord of Yoshi! Or Yoshis? Yoshies?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The attention to detail in both audio and graphic effects is especially apparent when you build up speed. Karts and bikes camber side-to-side when they hop and drift; tyres are spongey and visibly bounce and recoil according to the track surface; and sparks crackle off your vehicle as you drift and build up a boost, just to name a small handful of the details I&#8217;m talking about. I particularly like the tension of drifting around the sharpest corners, with the screen often tilting with you and making it extra satisfying to hit the apex. Plus, the music is noticeably exceptional, supplying a consistently energetic chorus that accentuates the gameplay &#8211; especially in the final unlockable tracks, which supply a climactic crescendo unlike any other I&#8217;ve experienced in <em>Mario Kart</em>. Overall, the whole experience is lifted by this pristine look and feel, whether it&#8217;s the relatively laid-back open world, or the competitive modes, where the palpable sense of momentum is most gripping. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a Knockout!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the &#8220;World&#8221; being a key selling point of the game, it&#8217;s still those core competitive modes that retained the tightest grip on my attention. Whilst the expected familiar selection of Grand Prix, custom VS, Battle, and Time Trial modes are all here, the game deserves credit for also introducing a brand new main mode to go alongside Grand Prix. This goes by the name of Knockout Tour, where 6 different tracks are combined together into one extra-long race. It takes advantage of the increased count of 24 racers to introduce checkpoint gates along the way, eliminating those at the back each time. Essentially, it&#8217;s a way of introducing popular battle royale-esque sensibilities into <em>Mario Kart</em>, and it creates a very fun sense of chaos &#8211; especially in local multiplayer, when your friends and you are desperately trying to stay in the race amidst the various items flying around!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14736" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A road trip across the Mushroom Kingdom! Thankfully, less traffic jams than real life</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Knockout Tours are arguably the biggest challenge awaiting completionist solo players in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It&#8217;s classic knowledge now that to get the maximum 3-star rating in Grand Prix, you need to win all four races; but in Knockout Tour, you need to be leading through every single checkpoint! This is an extremely tough task, as it necessitates not just victory, but to be consistently leading &#8211; even despite homing Red Shells, or the dreaded blue Spiny Shells that target the leader. I set myself the personal challenge of 3-starring every Knockout Tour, and it led to many failed attempts, but it was highly satisfying when I finally achieved that goal. For <em>Mario Kart</em> veterans, it&#8217;s a good addition to have a target that takes this extra level of dedication to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just mentioned the items and the chaos synonymous with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and that side of the game is just as entertaining (and frustrating) as ever before! To me, <em>Mario Kart</em> is similar to other games such as <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> because at their core, each iteration is built on the same gameplay loop, and it makes it tough to critique a new entry &#8211; on one hand, it&#8217;d be unwise to stray too far from what makes the series so immensely popular, but on the other, there has to be enough new ideas to justify a new game that still feels imaginative.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-18 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14737" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14738" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14740" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As aforementioned, the Knockout Tours are a standout way in which <em>Mario Kart World</em> achieves the latter, and some of these ideas bleed over into Grand Prix, where you don&#8217;t just drive around four tracks &#8211; instead, after the first race, the initial laps are rolling starts, as you drive across the world to the next track, road-trip style. It&#8217;s a neat way to keep the same formula but match it to the open-world aesthetic of <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and in VS there are options to play either in this mode, or with the traditional laps, catering to either preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further to this, there are tweaks to the racing itself, the most notable arguably being the new parkour/trick abilities. If you drive up onto a rail, you can grind along it and perform extra trick boosts, and you can even trick onto a wall and wall-ride along it, which opens up jaw-dropping shortcuts if you master this ability (there are plenty of astonishing clips doing the rounds online)! On top of this, drifting boosts can now be used in a straight line, and launch you off the ground slightly to help initiate some of these parkour moves. In combination, all these extra options elevate the height of the skill ceiling, and keep <em>Mario Kart World</em> engaging for those who have mastered previous entries in the series. Crucially, it does this without losing the accessibility as a go-to local multiplayer party game &#8211; the extra skills are a cherry on top for those who want to go above and beyond, but they&#8217;re not essential for winning races against the CPU.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14755" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Boo Cinema is another standout track, which applies a film filter to part of the course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Items are one of the infamous levellers of <em>Mario Kart</em>, and there have been some tweaks and additions on this front too. Your usual roster of shells, bananas, and mushrooms, and more are all here, although it&#8217;s noticeable that the raw power of items such as Bullet Bill have been slightly softened, perhaps to accommodate the new racer count of 24. Some of the notable new items include the golden Coin Shell, which leaves a trail of coins behind it, and the feather, which leaps you into the air, opening another opportunity to perform tricks, wallrides, and other shortcuts. To more literally aid more inexperienced players, there are still the helpful options for motion controls, auto-accelerate, and driving aids. Whilst these aren&#8217;t new, they&#8217;re still great to see return, and are often essential for balanced 4-player sessions that everyone can enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Give Me a Boost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As fun as <em>Mario Kart</em> can be in solo play, multiplayer is where the series has always shined brightest, and that continues to be the case for <em>World</em>. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to play with several combinations of friends, and the game has impressively accommodated their varying levels of <em>Mario Kart</em> experience each time, whether they&#8217;re a fresh newcomer or someone who&#8217;s been away from the series for a while. It&#8217;s easy to criticize the items when they&#8217;re hitting you, but they do a great job at helping those towards the back stay with the pack, and there&#8217;s still the option to use items such as shells and bananas defensively whilst in the lead.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14743" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Expect to shout at your friends &#8211; in a pleasant way, of course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Local multiplayer has consistently resulted in a brilliant time, complete with the playful shouting, cheers, and competitive back-and-forth that you hope for from <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; so I can report that it&#8217;s a success in that department! My favourite local multiplayer option is the extended custom VS modes, which have plenty of customisable options, including speed, difficulty, item frequency, and the amount of races, which go up to 32 at a time. As a big Formula 1 fan, I love to nerd out about the accumulated points and the drama of how the final standings will end up, so VS will inevitably become my most-played mode!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of online play, <em>Mario Kart World</em> doesn&#8217;t quite hit the same heights as local multiplayer, because of that lack of immediate in-person reaction &#8211; and whilst it&#8217;s admirable that Nintendo has added chat functionality, I did end up defaulting to using a Discord call instead, because of the familiarity and ease of use. The main motivation to play online is to raise your versus rating (VR), which is essentially the same system we had way back on <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>. In my opinion, it&#8217;s disappointing that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added more reasons to play online, especially in a gaming landscape where online games consistently add new modes, tournaments, and other rewards for playing consistently. The end result is that I quickly fell off of online multiplayer, and have focused mostly on solo and local multiplayer.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14753" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Driving on water supplies opportunity to perform tricks as you bounce over the waves</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, I found that the returning Battle Mode was most ideal for multiplayer &#8211; in <em>World</em>, there are two options, Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, which will be familiar to players of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. Balloon Battle gives you five balloons to protect whilst doing your best to hit opponents and earn points for removing their balloons, and Coin Runners has you searching for as many coins as you can, whilst again attempting to hit others and remove their coins (whilst avoiding them doing the same to you). I have to say, I&#8217;ve never been a huge Battle Mode fan over the years, and this version hasn&#8217;t changed that &#8211; but conversely, if you love Battle Mode, this will fill that quota well. My main disappointment is that the modes are time-based instead of score-based, as I generally prefer having that concrete target and the tension of seeing who can reach it first. Despite my criticisms, I am glad Battle Mode is back, as it offers a welcome change of pace from the racing modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Free as a Birdo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, a major differentiator for <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the inclusion of a free roam mode, where you can explore the tracks (and the spaces between them) at your leisure. There&#8217;s certainly an immediate novelty to this &#8211; I have nostalgic memories of <em>LEGO Racers 2</em>, which I played a lot on PC as a child, and included a similar experience of exploring an open world between races in a colourful, family-friendly world. My hope was that <em>Mario Kart World</em> might recapture that whimsical feeling, and supply a world with plenty of secrets and rewards, and most importantly motivation to find them. At first, <em>World </em>is successful in this; one of my earliest ventures was rocking up to the Dino Dino Jungle area, and visiting the inner laboratory/auditorium section. With precise driving and the careful use of tricks, you can make your way to the top of this area &#8211; which is thrilling the first time, but soon the realisation kicks in that there&#8217;s a lack of reason to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-19 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14746" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14747" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14745" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in free roam,<em> Mario Kart World </em>has an uncanny sense of emptiness, and it&#8217;s partly because that palpable sense of forward energy &#8211; which is so prevalent in the competitive modes &#8211; is gone, without being replaced by much else. It&#8217;s not that there isn&#8217;t anything to do in the open world &#8211; for example, there are Peach Medallions and Question Mark Panels to find, as well as P Switches that activate various challenges &#8211; but the problem is that there isn&#8217;t much motivation to track all these things down. The main rewards are stickers, which are small graphic icons you can attach next to your profile name, and feel inconsequential. More work needed to be done to make the world feel alive, and not just like a suspended state of limbo from the Grand Prix mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toads and Shy Guys milling around and making campfires are a great touch, but they&#8217;re another short-lived novelty that doesn&#8217;t add substance to the experience of navigating the open world. It&#8217;s fun to find items and complete challenges, but they&#8217;re incredibly scattered &#8211; and whilst there&#8217;s a tracker for the Question Mark Panels, there&#8217;s curiously no in-game indicator for how many Medallions or Switches are left to find (and also no statistics or records screen for other modes, either). On the other hand, something free roam does do well is increasing the level of awe the world has. You can travel a long way out into the ocean, and discover sea dragons, whales, and more, and I had a great time inspecting the scale of impressive courses such as DK Spaceport. As mentioned at the start of the review, <em>Mario Kart World</em> is a stunning game to look at and listen to, and the open world gives you more time to do just that.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14748" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>P Switch challenges often consist of time trials</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s a great shame that there&#8217;s no formal splitscreen multiplayer for the open world &#8211; there&#8217;s a partial workaround, by loading into an empty wireless mode lobby, but challenges are turned off, and it&#8217;s not at all optimal. In a game marketed on free roam, and in a series known for local multiplayer, it&#8217;s a disappointing oversight that significantly reduces the reason to play this way. I have occasionally played free roam in single-player as a laid-back secondary experience, for example when listening to a podcast or talking to friends &#8211; but it has untapped potential as a playground for friends to enjoy together, and honestly, I think this would&#8217;ve papered over many of my problems with the emptiness of the open world. Instead, more often than not, you&#8217;ll launch straight into Grand Prix, Knockout Tour, or VS, as that is where the most joyous parts of <em>Mario Kart World</em> reside.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to the end of this review, I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;ve flagged multiple issues I have with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; so I need to re-emphasize that this is a genuinely excellent <em>Mario Kart</em> game, that not only delivers the best-looking and best-sounding entry into the series, but has multiple new ideas and modes that make it feel distinct. Changeable character outfits, new trick mechanics, and especially the Knockout Tour mode supply fresh style that have made <em>World </em>my new go-to local multiplayer game, and a game I&#8217;ve spent many an enjoyable hour in by myself as well. The main disappointment has to be the free roam mode, which feels sparse and quickly struggles to retain player attention &#8211; and I really hope that in the future, Nintendo supports the game with additional content that fills out this world more. Alternatively, add Captain Toad to the playable characters, and I&#8217;ll probably be happy, haha! In all seriousness, <em>Mario Kart World</em> definitely has flaws, but the core racing experience is dazzling, and it&#8217;s a superb way to start the Switch 2 era!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

I&#8217;ve written about this in multiple posts on this site, and I&#8217;ve noticed how I&#8217;m gradually getting deeper into the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> ecosystem: starting with looking back to the anime, and then playing the online game <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and now getting more invested in learning about the current meta and competitive side of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> is a complicated game with lots to learn (and relearn) for someone like me, who hasn&#8217;t been up-to-date on the meta since I stopped playing local tournaments about a decade-and-a-half-ago. But I&#8217;m slowly learning, and I&#8217;m enjoying how it&#8217;s happening naturally, via watching various YouTube creators, playing different decks in <em>Master Duel</em>, and even constructing a real-life deck that I could conceivably return to local tournaments with. So, in this post, I&#8217;m going to talk a little more about these various aspects of the game, the deck I&#8217;m playing, and why I&#8217;m enjoying this process so much!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Getting the Fire (Kings) Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve already written about <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/12/31/why-im-giving-yu-gi-oh-master-duel-another-shot/">how I&#8217;ve gotten back into <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em></a>, but only now have I reached the point where I&#8217;m starting to understand the competitive meta. At first, I was playing relatively low-powered (by current standards) decks such as Dark Magician and Monarchs, because those cards were familiar to me. But realistically, those decks aren&#8217;t fast-paced enough to keep up nowadays, so I started testing other avenues. I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of Gravekeepers, which can sometimes work in the competitive scene, if you draw the right cards (such as Necrovalley) in order to shut off abilities from the opponent. But this wasn&#8217;t a strategy that was going to help me learn the competitive game long-term, and I found that I eventually reached a point of repetition and subsequent burnout playing the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-20 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14664" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14665" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14666" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gravekeepers brought me a decent level of success!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This brought me to the HERO cards, especially Destiny HEROs, as I have a nostalgic affinity for them. The modern HERO cards have many combo effects that special summon various powerful cards, so they were much more helpful for learning the increased modern speed of combos in a deck. But I still found the HERO cards to lack flexibility for different situations, and I again reached a point where I hit a brick wall with the deck. It felt like I had hit also hit a wall in my efforts to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> in a contemporary fashion, as I couldn&#8217;t find a deck I clicked with. So I took a bit of a break from <em>Master Duel</em>, and started looking into which decks would be viable to assemble if I was playing the physical TCG (Trading Card Game). After looking at various Structure Decks as starting points, I finally found one which made sense to test out: Fire Kings!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire Kings are a deck based around monsters that destroy themselves either on the field, in the hand, or from the deck, to then activate various effects, including summoning monsters and destroying cards on the field. In addition, they have an impressive boss monster in &#8220;Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings&#8221;, which can destroy every other monster on the field (and has a magnificent summoning animation in <em>Master Duel</em>, see below)! The fiery aesthetic of these cards is well-realised in the stunning artwork, which mixes regal distinction with blazing power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-21 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14678" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14674" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14676" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14677" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14675" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Master Duel summon animations are, in a word, awesome</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the cards are relatively accessible in the real world, with only &#8220;Fire King Courtier Ulcanix&#8221; demanding a higher price point (of about £15 a copy). Most of the main Fire King cards can be acquired in the modestly priced Fire King Structure Deck &#8211; I bought three copies of this, as well as some other products (such as the recent Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Deck, which includes reprints of staple cards such as Infinite Impermanence), to construct a real-life Fire King deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, I find it helpful to have a real deck in front of me, which I can draw test hands with to slowly understand the playstyle better (I&#8217;m hoping for a reprint of Ulcanix, so I don&#8217;t have to drop £45-ish on a playset)! The result of this process is finally finding an archetype I like, which is viable to build in both <em>Master Duel</em> and the TCG &#8211; and to top it all off, Fire Kings are competitively strong too! Whilst they aren&#8217;t currently considered a top tier deck like Maliss or Ryzeal, Fire Kings do perform well in current competitive play, even winning the YCS Birmingham event this year, piloted by Dinh-Kha Bui! This tells me that if I can improve my own skill and understanding of the deck, then Fire King can reach a high ceiling of play in both <em>Master Duel</em> and local tournaments (should I decide to go&#8230; More on that later)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14669" height="696" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>It needs some changes still, but my TCG Fire King deck is taking shape!</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m playing lots of Fire King in Ranked games on <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and with every game, every new scenario, and every mistake I make (I&#8217;m admittedly still making a lot of those), I&#8217;m learning the intricacies of the deck, how to perform the best combos, and how to make the strongest boards in combination with my Extra Deck of Link, XYZ, and Synchro Monsters. I like how Fire Kings have such a strong Fire connection, which enables them to make use of several non-Fire cards as additions to the deck. For example, a common choice for Fire Kings is &#8220;Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames&#8221;, which can revive back one of your Fire Kings alongside it when summoned. This synergy is very satisfying, and ties into the overall theme of the deck, resulting in an archetype that feels richly-designed and well-realised. I&#8217;m enjoying learning the Fire King strategies, and I hope that by my next <em>Master Duel</em> post on this site, I can report that I&#8217;ve become steadily better at piloting the deck!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Creators I Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside my own proactive efforts to become better at contemporary <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I&#8217;ve been watching several YouTube creators that are a brilliant source of both entertainment and knowledge for me. <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/">In previous posts, I&#8217;ve mentioned</a> how TGS Anime and Team APS helped me get reacquainted with classic <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, which lines up with my aforementioned play of anime decks such as Dark Magician. I still watch these channels, but I&#8217;ve added several others to my regular watchlist, including the &#8220;wonky quartet&#8221; of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGuDrveqBgD0S9nqaOPw6Q">Farfa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MBTYuGiOh">MBT</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Nyhmnim">Nyhmnim</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dzeeff">Dzeeff</a>, who consistently create great content focused primarily around <em>Master Duel</em>. Often, they add fun variables to challenge themselves, such as in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xajsij7iS98">Master Chef</a> series by MBT, or the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbldWY88--A">Storage Wars</a> series by Farfa.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Videos like this (by Joshua Schmidt) are brilliant at showcasing both the fun and skill of </em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly thanks to these channels and their collaborations, I&#8217;ve also become aware of other popular YouTubers &#8211; specifically, ones focused around high-level competitive play. These are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaSchmidtYGO">Joshua Schmidt</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jessekottonygo">Jesse Kotton</a>, who are well-known for often winning or placing highly in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> tournaments. Both of them balance speaking confidently about modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> with also making videos that are fun to watch, which is very impressive and makes them stand out. Both their channels have been helpful to me, and I also like it when they have those earlier-mentioned collaborations with channels like Farfa and MBT, as they bring a little bit of extra seriousness to those videos. Discovering this range of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> players and creators has been an unexpected extra positive side effect of getting back into the game and franchise!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">It&#8217;s Time to Duel?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;ve talked about how I&#8217;ve not just been looking at the digital version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> (with <em>Master Duel</em>), but also my physical collection of cards as well. I have a fairly large amount of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> cards, mostly from my childhood and teenage years, and further supplemented with occasional more recent purchases when something has stood out to me. Those Fire King and Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Decks have given me access to plenty of modern cards to assemble a deck with, and I also picked up products like the Duel Devastator set from 2019, which was full of guaranteed competitive staples like &#8220;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&#8221;. This is all to say that I&#8217;m nearing a place where not only am I improving at <em>Master Duel</em>, but I could conceivably go to an in-person event near me and test out my skills in person (scary, I know, haha)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14673" height="672" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Recent structure decks have been ideal for helping me build Fire Kings</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Jokes aside, there&#8217;s only a few things stopping me from doing this, and one of them is overcoming that social anxiety. I&#8217;ve become better at this over the years, but I definitely find the initial ice-breaking of heading to a new club/group quite daunting. About a year ago, I also experienced this when joining a nearby running club &#8211; there is that initial awkward stage of getting to know people and faces, but it gets easier over time. I&#8217;m confident that this wouldn&#8217;t be a long-term issue, especially as I now know a friend who has introduced me to a local store that hosts Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next barrier is more closely related to the theme of this post &#8211; and that&#8217;s a personal target to be relatively well-acquainted with the game before showing up to a local tournament again. I&#8217;m definitely nearing this stage, and part of this preparation would be making the finishing touches to my Fire King deck. I&#8217;d like to get that playset of three Fire King Courtier Ulcanix first, as they&#8217;re integral to the strength of the deck. The card is out of stock on most sites, and my best route currently seems to be waiting for a good UK price on Cardmarket. I could wait and hope for a cheaper reprint, but there is no sign of this happening at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jesse Kotton has a video about Fire Kings and their affordability</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I&#8217;d like to get a copy of some extra staple Extra Deck cards such as &#8220;S:P Little Knight&#8221;, and possibly acquire some extra non-Fire King cards that often seen play in the deck, such as &#8220;Bystial Magnamhut&#8221; and &#8220;Bystial Druisworm&#8221;. The main thing I&#8217;m keeping an eye on is price &#8211; for example, in an ideal world I&#8217;d also add competitively strong cards such as &#8220;Mulcharmy Fuwalos&#8221; to the deck, but that would cost another £70-ish for a playset, and I haven&#8217;t even gone to a local event yet (I do have a tendency for overthinking)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve still not decided if I&#8217;ll make the time to make the leap to playing the TCG in-person again, but I&#8217;m getting increasingly tempted to have a go. It would enable me to test out my skills, and it could also be a way to make new friends and connections. When I went to local events in my teenage years, I enjoyed the trading side of the game too &#8211; and who knows, perhaps that&#8217;s a better way to acquire some of these missing cards for my Fire King deck. If I do decide to go, I hope to write up about my experience on this site, however well (or badly, haha) it goes!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the third <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> centric post I&#8217;ve written over the last 8 months, and they&#8217;re good reflections of how I&#8217;ve gotten back into the franchise as a whole: not just my nostalgic connection, but how I&#8217;ve been learning about the modern game and how it&#8217;s evolved over time. I admittedly used to be someone who lamented that <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> had become too complicated and suffered from power creep &#8211; and whilst those aren&#8217;t completely untrue, I think they were oversimplifications on my part. Having now taken the time to ingrain myself back into the world of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I see that the game has developed into something new &#8211; something faster, more complex, and in some ways arguably better than before.</p>\n\n\n\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top: 75%;">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this post has explained how I&#8217;m pushing myself to get better at the game, with the conduit of a Fire King deck as my resource for playing the game at a higher skill level than before. I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn still, both about this deck and other decks, but I&#8217;m having an excellent time doing so &#8211; which is probably evidenced by me considering playing the TCG in-person again at some point in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this post, and I sincerely hope you are happy, healthy, and having a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/03/how-fire-kings-are-helping-me-learn-competitive-play-in-yu-gi-oh-master-duel/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Right then, let&#8217;s get into the post, and I hope you enjoy the read!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Edinburgh Marathon 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/">my build-up and training for the Edinburgh Marathon</a> multiple times since I started planning in November 2024, and after a train journey up to Edinburgh and a couple of days in the city, on May 25th 2025 the day finally arrived for my first marathon! My parents and some close friends were there to support me, and I also had the support of all those who contributed to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">my charity fundraiser for Beat</a> (the Eating Disorder charity). Thank you to everyone who donated or even just took a look at my Justgiving page &#8211; I&#8217;m really proud to spread awareness for a charity that means a lot to both my family and I.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14636" height="607" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So, you may be asking, how did the marathon go? It was a tough one, and Scotland threw all the elements at us. There were periods of sun, rain, strong winds, and even hail when I reached approximately mile 20! As expected, the last 10-ish miles are where the battle really begins, as much mental as physical. It was important to me that I do my absolute best and never stop or walk if I can help it, and at mile 25 I got to see my friends and family cheer me on as I neared the finish line!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was an unexpectedly dramatic finish. With the finish line in sight, and as I pushed for the line with maybe 100 metres left to go, I was struck with the notorious &#8220;jelly legs&#8221; and fell. I managed to get back to my feet with the help of another nearby runner, and made it to the line. As someone who is very critical of themselves, I was disappointed at not finishing the run in better style &#8211; and this is where my family and friends were invaluable at stopping me from being too harsh on myself. It was a great reminder of how much they care for me and how much support I had on the day, and I am incredibly grateful to them and everyone else who has congratulated me since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-22 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14624" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Early on&#8230; !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14622" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the race</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14623" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final stretch!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Including Gift Aid, we raised £1,821.77 for Beat, and I&#8217;m very proud of this, as well as the personal achievement of finishing the marathon. I&#8217;m still deciding whether or not to do another marathon &#8211; after not finishing in quite the way I hoped, I am feeling motivated to do another one, maybe the Norfolk Marathon in 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest gaming news stories over the last few months has been the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. As not only a gaming fan but also specifically a Nintendo fan, I got my console immediately, and have been playing it a significant amount since! Whilst it&#8217;s more of an iteration than a revolution in terms of hardware, I personally enjoy the larger console and screen size, as it fits my larger hands very well. The only exclusive game I have so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I&#8217;ve put many an hour into!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14620" height="534" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, <em>Mario Kart World</em> feels like the first new entry since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> many years ago, as I played a lot of the latter on Wii U and never felt the need to buy the <em>Deluxe</em> version on Switch. Therefore, <em>World</em> feels very fresh to me, and it&#8217;s also visually spectacular (especially on a big 4K HDR TV). I&#8217;ve 3-starred all the Grand Prix and am now working away at the Knockout Tours, which are battle-royale style checkpoint races new to this game. These Knockout Tours are very tough to get 3-stars on, but I&#8217;m enjoying the challenge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a few criticisms of the game &#8211; including my own biased disappointment at no inclusion of Captain Toad, haha &#8211; but also about the open-world twist on the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula. In concept, it&#8217;s a smart way to go, but I have mixed feelings on the execution, as the world feels a little empty and repetitive to explore. Despite this, I&#8217;m going to save my full thoughts, as I plan to write a dedicated review at some point soon. One thing is for sure, and that&#8217;s <em>Mario Kart World</em> being the new go-to local multiplayer game for my friends and I!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the Switch 2 itself, it does feel like an investment for the future, as outside of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and now <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> (which I hope to play soon), there&#8217;s a lack of headline exclusive titles. But for now, the hardware upgrade and promise for the future &#8211; plus the fun of <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; has made it feel worth the purchase for this Nintendo fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-text-align-left">My watching habits have been quite eclectic recently! In terms of the films, the standout has to be <em>Superman</em> &#8211; as a huge DC fan, I had high hopes for this fresh, brighter take on the iconic character, and James Gunn and company thoroughly delivered. The film is a shining beacon of positivity, fun, and creativity, and David Corenswet is a brilliant Superman to centre the new DCU around. I&#8217;m very excited to see where things go in the future, but for now I&#8217;m just so happy that we got a satisfyingly hopeful take on Superman again. I&#8217;m hoping that these vibes continue in <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> on the Marvel side, which I&#8217;m going to see tomorrow as of writing this!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-23 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14617" height="1023" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg?w=819" width="819" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14618" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg?w=691" width="691" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of TV, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to <em>The Walking Dead</em> (I really liked the recent film <em>28 Years Later</em>, and I think it&#8217;s helped put me in the zombie mood). I originally stopped watch <em>The Walking Dead</em> in Season 8, which is where a lot of people dropped off, in the war between Rick and Negan. However, I heard that it picks up afterwards, so I decided to go back, charge through Season 8, and see what I find in those last few seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst Season 8 remains a poorly-paced season, I&#8217;m glad I went back, especially because Season 9 is brilliant TV. Clearly lessons were learned from the negative reception to previous seasons, and Season 9 focuses back on character development, inventive new threats, and grounded emotional stakes. It hooked me in and I&#8217;m enjoying the ride of these last few seasons!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m already looking ahead to watching the newer <em>The Walking Dead</em> spin-offs such as <em>The Ones Who Live</em> and <em>Daryl Dixon</em>, to see where these characters end up. Other than <em>The Walking Dead</em>, I&#8217;m also slowly making my way through the latest Marvel show <em>Ironheart</em>, which hasn&#8217;t been marketed very well by Disney &#8211; which is a shame, as it&#8217;s very well-made and full of great performances.  To loop back around to <em>Superman</em> and the DCU, I&#8217;m also eagerly anticipating <em>Peacemaker</em> Season 2, which will tie into that film and the larger world!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this summation of some of what I&#8217;ve been up to recently! One of my goals for the rest of the year is to start writing here more consistently &#8211; I&#8217;ve been saying this for a while, but it&#8217;s something I really want to get back to. It&#8217;s been necessary for me to spend more time on my personal life and take breaks from writing, but in the process of that personal growth, it&#8217;s reminded me how much I like writing about the things I play, watch, and do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I often get distracted or hit writer&#8217;s block, so I&#8217;m considering the approach of setting aside a little bit of time every day to write with no background music/videos, as opposed to my previous strategy of writing in big time chunks all at once. Either way, I&#8217;m planning to be more present on here in the second half of the year, and I look forward to it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sincerely hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a wonderful day!

Many hours of my weekends have been devoted to building up my distance; I am a longtime runner, but had never ran more than a half-marathon before my marathon training this year. Last weekend I did my longest run, a 23.2-miler (my poor legs), and I&#8217;m now tapering down before the big day. My mental health has been low recently, and the marathon has been a good target for my mind to try and focus on, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14584" height="560" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025"><em>https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m both excited and nervous for the event, for which I will be journeying to Edinburgh a few days beforehand. I&#8217;m also doing the run to fundraise for <a href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/">Beat, the Eating Disorder charity</a> &#8211; this is a cause close to my heart, as my amazing sister Charlotte passed away in 2007 after battling anorexia. As aforementioned in my previous post, you can view my Justgiving page <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">at this link</a>, and any donations would be very much appreciated, but there&#8217;s no pressure at all to donate!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Upcoming Book Projects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a designer for Titan Books, I get to work on some really exciting projects, and honestly that fulfilment in my work means a lot to me &#8211; it&#8217;s very rewarding to have a physical product of your work, especially when it&#8217;s related to a property (such as Marvel or <em>Star Trek</em>) that you enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get to experience working on several exciting film retrospectives, and some upcoming ones from Titan include books on <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>,<em> </em>The Crow films, and <em>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</em>, which you can see covers for below!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-24 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14562" height="904" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706" width="706" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14564" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800" width="800" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14563" height="927" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of fiction, the final Mike Hammer novel <em>Baby, It&#8217;s Murder</em> released recently, and there are upcoming Marvel paperbacks for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Annihilation</em> and <em>Doctor Strange: Dimension Wa</em>r.

I&#8217;m very impressed by what was shown, and have my pre-order in for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. Whilst I like physical media, I can&#8217;t justify that high £74.99 price point for buying <em>Mario Kart</em> separately. Those game prices are the main criticism so far &#8211; the only other hesitation is seeing Nintendo choose surety over innovation in terms of hardware. I&#8217;m confident the Switch 2 will be a huge hit, but I do slightly miss those eclectic reveals of the Wii U, 3DS, Wii, DS, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what I&#8217;m playing, I&#8217;ve been struggling with burnout and game-playing-motivation recently, so haven&#8217;t played much. I have however briefly gotten back into<em> Bravely Default</em> on the DS (which ironically has a Switch 2 version coming soon), and continue to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel </em>now and then. I&#8217;m hoping my game-playing motivation returns soon, but am also not putting too much pressure on myself, as I don&#8217;t want to force it. I look forward to the Switch 2 hopefully reigniting that fire a bit &#8211; oh, and please add Captain Toad to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, Nintendo! It would make me very happy indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve admittedly struggled to get back into games recently &#8211; but when it comes to TV, I&#8217;ve been keeping more up-to-date, and there&#8217;s a lot that I&#8217;ve been liking recently! The second season of <em>Andor </em>and second (or fifteenth, depending on how you count) season of <em>Doctor Who</em> are currently airing, and both are fantastic. <em>Andor </em>continues the engrossing drama and brilliantly tangible visual design of the first season, and this era of <em>Doctor Who</em> is really hitting a stride, with unexpected surprises amidst the brilliantly imaginative stories. I really hope the rumours of <em>Doctor Who</em> taking a break after this season are false, as Ncuti Gatwa is sensational, portraying a charismatic and emotionally healed Doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also just finished watching through <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Netflix-verse of Marvel TV (especially<em> Jessica Jones</em>), so to see some of those characters returning has been wonderful. The series feels like both a reinvention and a continuation of the original three <em>Daredevil </em>seasons, and I&#8217;ve been thrilled by how well it has turned out. The character work, cinematography, and courtroom/political intrigue is all here, and I am stoked for Season 2 &#8211; I just hope some of the Defenders do turn up in Season 2, including not just Jessica Jones, but Luke Cage and Iron Fist too!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a quick rundown on what I&#8217;ve been doing, playing, and watching! I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this quick update &#8211; I think of this site like my own digital journal, so even when I take a break, I always like to come back with some sort of update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really hope you are happy and healthy, and that you are having a wonderful week. See you next time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mikehammer_babyitsmurder_fc.jpg?w=666', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/81tvyzi3mvl._sl1500_.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doctorstrange_dimensionwar_salescover-1.jpg?w=678', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/godzillamovienovelization_omnibus_salescvr_dec24.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}]}

With such an expansive and imaginative open world, it&#8217;s a double-edged sword when it comes to DLC; on one hand, you know people like this world, but on the other, you really have to make the expansion stand out from that world to set it apart. For <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, this is done with a new area named The Cut, full of cold weather, dangerous new machines such as the Scorcher, and intriguing story reveals that bridge the gap between <em>Zero Dawn</em> and the sequel <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/03/30/horizon-forbidden-west-review/">Forbidden West</a></em> (incidentally, the only reason I haven&#8217;t included the <em>Forbidden West</em> DLC on this list is because I don&#8217;t have a PS5 to play it on)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cut is full of activities for main character Aloy, whether it be exploration, narrative, or combat &#8211; including optional super-hard combat trials for the real masochists among us. The local tribe (named the Banuk) tie into the aforementioned overarching story, and as Aloy discovers literal machinations under the snow-covered surface of The Cut, it increased my anticipation around where the sequel will go next &#8211; which is surely a sign of a successful DLC. When I wrote <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/02/14/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds-review/">my review for <em>The Frozen Wilds</em></a> back in 2018, I also noted how it made small steps to improve dialogue animations (which were sometimes quite static in the main game), and you can see how that was continued to full fruition in the dynamic conversations of <em>Forbidden West</em>. Not only is <em>The Frozen Wilds</em> substantial and utterly beautiful to look at, but it actively improves the gameplay foundation of a series I adore.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Mass Effect 3: Leviathan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious choices when it comes to <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC are the fantastic <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> for <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, or the <em>Citadel </em>DLC that served as an epilogue for <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. However, the expansion I have the strongest personal connection to is <em>Leviathan</em>, the first of the <em>Mass Effect 3</em> DLCs. I only bought an Xbox 360 shortly before <em>Mass Effect 3</em> launched, and that game was my gateway into the series (I went back and played the entire trilogy afterwards). After mainly playing on Nintendo consoles beforehand, the concept of single-player expansions was relatively foreign to me &#8211; but after being so enraptured by <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, I was incredibly excited at the prospect of more story content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ending of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is infamous for being disappointing to many people &#8211; but in a way, it made me more excited for DLC that would further flesh out the backstory of the giant world-destroying Reapers that you face throughout the trilogy. <em>Leviathan </em>is all about the discovery of a secret race named (you guessed it) Leviathans, who predate even the mysterious Reapers. In the DLC, you journey across space to piece together morsels of information about their origins. I particularly like the planet 2181 Despoina, a planet covered in water and full of secrets and intense combat situations. That sense of discovering places that were meant to be hidden forever is thrilling, especially when you get to the climactic moments that reveal how the Leviathans play into the wider battle against the Reapers &#8211; and it&#8217;s that rush of energy that makes <em>Leviathan </em>stand out as my favourite <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker &#8211; Special Episode</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very happy when <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> got a Switch release, as it allowed even more people to play this gem of a game &#8211; and I was even happier when in early 2019, a new selection of levels was added with the <em>Special Episode</em> expansion! Whilst this isn&#8217;t a large single-player story expansion like some of the other games I&#8217;ve included in this list, I wanted to highlight this DLC for <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, as it&#8217;s a joyful addition with plenty of value for money (currently £5.39 on Switch). Also, yes, I&#8217;m biased for Captain Toad, but that&#8217;s besides the point, aha&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who haven&#8217;t played <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, it&#8217;s a delightful puzzle game that sees Captain Toad and Toadette make their way through levels based on Hakoniwa Japanese box gardens, with the player rotating and shifting the levels around in order to progress. The <em>Special Episode</em> adds 5 brand new levels and 13 challenges that reinvent previous courses, so 18 new levels to play through in total. As with the main game, there&#8217;s a lovely variety, from haunted caves full of Boos, to a treacherous ship, to another minecart ride! As <em>Treasure Tracker</em> is presented in several book chapters, the DLC additions fit in smoothly, and I&#8217;d frankly happily play as many levels as Nintendo is happy to add (I really hope we get a sequel one day)! The <em>Special Episode</em> is a wonderful and endearing addition to <em>Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Dragon Age: Inquisition &#8211; Trespasser</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a brilliant time with all of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> DLCs, but it&#8217;s the final DLC <em>Trespasser </em>that&#8217;s my favourite of the bunch. Requiring story completion to play, it&#8217;s a definitive end &#8211; and cliffhanger &#8211; to <em>Inquisition</em>, even preventing you from returning to the main game afterwards. The plot brings the player to a summit assembled to decide what happens to the Inquisition now that the main threat has been ended, but soon a new conspiracy is discovered. This eventually reveals that Solas (an eleven mage who&#8217;s a consistent presence in the <em>Dragon Age</em> series) is secretly Fen&#8217;Harel and the Dread Wolf. He&#8217;s been responsible for many of the magical occurrences that have played a part in the game, and he&#8217;s now seeking to collapse the Veil that separates worlds, despite the catastrophic consequences it&#8217;d cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For players who&#8217;ve spent many hours around this character who they thought was on their side, it&#8217;s a dramatic reveal that created a lot of excitement for the sequel to <em>Inquisition</em>. Solas even cuts off the arm of the main character to prevent them stopping him, before disappearing and leaving the player with the decision of whether the Inquisition should be continued or disbanded. <em>Trespasser </em>does have competent combat elements too, but the story is the focus here, and it&#8217;s always been memorable thanks to the anticipation it created for the sequel. However, despite <em>Trespasser </em>releasing in 2015, we only got <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/08/04/dragon-age-the-veilguard-why-im-optimistic-what-id-like-to-see-next/">The Veilguard</a></em> at the end of 2024, so it did leave a lot of time for players to stew and theorize!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Resident Evil 5: Lost in Nightmares/Desperate Escape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I first played <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/02/resident-evil-5-review/">Resident Evil 5</a></em> in 2020, and I did so on PS4, where both the DLC expansions <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> and <em>Desperate Escape</em> are bundled in with the main game, so I&#8217;m going to include them both together for the purposes of this list. Whilst <em>Resident Evil 5</em> certainly has flaws, it also has a lot to praise, such as how it leans into cinematic storytelling. The two DLCs act as a prequel and an in-between-quel, and give an opportunity to play as series mainstay (and <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/23/my-5-favourite-video-game-characters/">my favourite <em>Resident Evil</em> character</a>) Jill Valentine, as well as the pilot Josh Stone. Firstly, <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> is set before <em>Resident Evil 5</em>, and shows Jill and Chris Redfield infiltrating the Spencer estate to confront Albert Wesker. We see snippets of this encounter &#8211; which leaves Jill presumed dead &#8211; during the main game as flashbacks, but here we get to play through it all: puzzles, combat, and Wesker boss fight included. Jill and Chris are the quintessential <em>Resident Evil</em> partners, so it&#8217;s comforting to see them interact (well, as comforting as it can be when facing down monstrosities).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Desperate Escape</em> is set towards the end of the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> campaign, just after Sheva Alomar and Chris manage to free Jill from the mind control of Wesker. Whilst the former pair go after Wesker in the main game, we never got to see how Jill and Josh made their own way out, and we get to play that out for ourselves here. This is arguably the tougher DLC of the two, less puzzle-focused and more about, well, desperately escaping &#8211; ending with a horde-assault sequence that gets frenetic on the higher difficulties. Both DLCs are great for different reasons, and as a combo add a lot to the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> story experience. Jill getting her time to shine is great too, especially as she wasn&#8217;t playable in the main game. This is timeline-wise the last time we got to play as Jill in the main story, too &#8211; please take the hint, Capcom&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The Last of Us: Left Behind</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You knew this had to be on here, right? In my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> rose the bar for story expansions, just like <em>The Last of Us</em> rose the bar for narrative video games. <em>Left Behind</em> fits into the later portions of <em>The Last of Us</em>, after Joel is near-fatally injured, and Ellie is hunting for medical supplies in an abandoned mall. This forms part of Left Behind, but it&#8217;s also interspersed with flashbacks to three weeks before the main game, where Ellie is taken by her friend Riley to break into another abandoned mall in Boston &#8211; and this is where the DLC shines at its brightest. As with many of the other expansions in my list, the core gameplay is a solid continuation of the main game, but it&#8217;s the story advancements and believable character interactions which leave the strongest impact here, giving us brand new information on Elie and her backstory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the best parts of the DLC aren&#8217;t fighting infected, but instead when Riley and Ellie are exploring the desolate mall. They find carousels, video games, and plenty more to play with and talk about. The in-gameplay dialogue that <em>The Last of Us</em> uses so well is continued here, resulting in a moment between the two girls that is both natural and surprising, especially for blockbuster games at the time. It&#8217;s all interwoven with that bittersweet sense that something bad is going to happen &#8211; after all, this is an apocalyptic world, we didn&#8217;t hear much about Riley in the main game, and we know Ellie gets bitten at some point. Those moments do come, but they maintain all their dramatic impact because of the masterful way Naughty Dog combines gameplay and narrative (and also because of brilliant performances by Yaani King as Riley and Ashley Johnson as Ellie). As I said at the start &#8211; in my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> raised the bar for story expansions, and it&#8217;s still one of my favourites to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>With that, we come to the end of the list! As mentioned earlier, there are plenty other great DLC expansions out there, but these are six of my own favourites, each for their own specific reasons.

Therefore, I thought I&#8217;d give a quick overview of what&#8217;s been added to the game and why I&#8217;ve found it so rewarding!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Look to the Skies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s immediately obvious which archetype Konami is pushing with this event &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the Sky Strikers, who were introduced back in 2018 and have become incredibly popular since. The first two <em>Master Duel </em>anniversaries tied into Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so it&#8217;s admittedly a shame we don&#8217;t have a Red-Eyes Black Dragon event to round out the central three <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> Duel Monsters characters of Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey &#8211; but I suppose the power of the fan-favourite Sky Striker characters Raye and Roze was just too strong!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14502" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14515" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14519" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png" width="2560" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop is filled with new items featuring board backgrounds, player mates, card backs, a deck box, and more focused around the Sky Strikers, plus admittedly stunning alternate arts for the main Sky Striker cards. I&#8217;m not an expert on the archetype, but all the amazing artwork and shiny bonuses definitely has me intrigued to learn more about the characters!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of&#8230; The new solo Story is unsurprisingly focused around the Sky Strikers. However, what makes this even more special is the addition of animated sequences within the Sky Striker story, which have been taken from the upcoming anime <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME: THE CHRONICLES</em>. For those who don&#8217;t know, Konami recently announced that this anime will be starting in April 2025, and will be focused on the actual card lore itself. So, instead of revolving around duels (like <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em>, <em>5D&#8217;s</em>, or <em>Arc-V</em> did, for example), <em>CHRONICLES </em>will be set within the world of the cards, which is very exciting! It&#8217;s been announced that these episodes will include the archetypes Fall of Albaz, Dogmatika Ecclesia, and yes &#8211; Sky Strikers!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14505" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14507" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14508" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing small clips of the anime in the <em>Master Duel</em> solo mode was unexpected, and acts as a lovely tease of what&#8217;s to come. The animation is vibrant and expressive, and it&#8217;s great to see this willingness to expand on the card lore &#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely be checking these anime episodes out as they release. Also I have to mention that the new UI for the solo mode is much improved and more player-friendly, segmenting the various solo stories up in a cleaner way, which I appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Festival Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next major addition to <em>Master Duel</em> is the two Festivals that are happening this month &#8211; the first one, Legend Anthology, features a custom banlist that excludes common staples, such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. In theory, this shakes up the meta within the mode, especially with three pre-made decks ready for players to use. However, this mode is dominated by the new Exodia deck and cards, in particular The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate, which can reach upwards of 10000 ATK and can also negates card effects. Often, the match is decided on the coin flip, as if a player goes first and gets out this Exodia card, it&#8217;s extremely hard to the opponent to stage a comeback. Still, the mode has plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, so it&#8217;s worth grinding through.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14511" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14510" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14509" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m much more excited for the upcoming Fusion X Synchro Festival (starting 17th February), which will restrict the Extra Deck to only Synchro/Fusion monsters, and cut out all the options that Link and XYZ monsters have added. I&#8217;m growing to respect those newer card types more over time, but it&#8217;ll still be fun to play some games that make players revert to pre-XYZ strategies. Hopefully it&#8217;ll allow some of my older classic decks to be a bit more viable (at least briefly)! Just like the Legend Anthology, there are plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, which should make it worth the playtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Plenty of Prizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that has always pleasantly surprised me about <em>Master Duel</em> is how generous it is as a Free-to-Play game. The 3rd Anniversary is timed with the start of a new Duel Pass, which is a 700-Gem purchase that &#8211; if you complete it &#8211; earns you all your Gems back, as well as cosmetic and in-game currency rewards, such as a background themed around the aforementioned Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate. If I had to suggest improvements, it would be for a few more unique cosmetic rewards in the Pass &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to complain too much about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the Sky Striker items I mentioned earlier, the shop also has a new Structure Deck full of the expensive HERO cards, new Selection Packs that include those new Exodia cards, as well as another chance to buy previous Anniversary-exclusive items themed around Blue-Eyes White Dragon. As someone who took a long break from <em>Master Duel</em>, I appreciate this a lot, and am slowly working my way through acquiring these.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14517" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14512" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14514" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The deck that&#8217;s currently giving me the most success is my anti-meta Gravekeeper deck, which I&#8217;ve fine-tuned to include more drawing cards and be more reliable (see the decklist image above). I&#8217;ve also finally put together my Destiny HERO deck, which is more meta, and features more Extra Deck combo cards. For long-term success in <em>Master Duel</em>, I need to learn more of these combo plays (and how to combat other combo decks), so I don&#8217;t want to stick with anti-meta decks like Gravekeepers for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my quick summation of the new <em>Master Duel</em> features and how they&#8217;ve positively affected the game &#8211; I&#8217;m really enjoying the amount to do right now, as well as the continued support Konami is bringing. I&#8217;m still slowly re-acclimatising myself to <em>Master Duel</em> after such a long time away, but I&#8217;m continuing to enjoy it and play a few duels every day. If anyone else is intrigued in giving the game a shot, I&#8217;d say now is an ideal time to jump on board, as the game is offering many player-friendly rewards that not only play on nostalgia for <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, but also relate to future projects like the <em>CHRONICLES </em>anime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this quick article &#8211; and if you&#8217;re playing <em>Master Duel</em>, let me know how you&#8217;re finding it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}]}

The system is called <strong>Projects</strong> and is optional. It offers players who want to wipe their character and start over fresh the chance to do so—gaining some bragging rights and cosmetic rewards in the process. I think this is an interesting take on the topic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Many online action games with player progression systems have implemented the concept of “wipes” with the intent to reset everything back to even on a set cadence. The goal is to keep the game fresh for veteran players and ensure that newer players can enjoy the game without staring at a mountain of progress to get on equal footing with the veterans. This makes sense for dedicated veterans and new players alike but misses what is likely the biggest player group: what I call the “core gamer.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;These core gamers, like myself, can’t put massive hours per week into a game, and thus, games with wipes become less attractive because the destination never feels reachable. We are always stuck in the progression step, and while progression is an attractive feature in the games we play, it’s the persistence of that progression that’s the main draw in the first place. Restarting after a mandatory wipe just feels bad. My friend and I quit <strong>Once Human</strong>, a game we both were enjoying, after the first wipe we were subjected to.

I really like how they’ve framed their decision here:</p><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides. Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall. So, as we have done with several other mechanics, before mimicking other established mechanics, we’d like to try our own method. Ideally to the end that best suits ARC Raiders and a larger majority of its players."&nbsp;</i></blockquote><p></p><p>The main concept of the Projects is that their initiation is <strong>player-controlled</strong>. If I have time in my upcoming gaming schedule, I can opt to start the project, and that will reset my character; my efforts will then go into the project. If I want to play the game more casually, without dedicated time in the schedule, then I don\'t have to start the project; I just keep on with my persistent progression.</p>\n<p>There are still details to understand about how players on Projects interact with those that are not. I assume they will be mixed into matches to avoid creating a queue issue where players are waiting for matches to start.

There are likely some considerations to avoid abuse—where, if a project (as featured in the article) requires certain items, those items can\'t just be given to a player by another player dropping them in a match. But the death knell for this type of system and game would be creating a barrier to friends playing together, so I can\'t imagine they\'d block players based on Project status.</p>\n<p>The one area I expect to be a hot topic is rewards.

For some players, that may be a reason to question why they would even participate in a project if the reward is only intangible stuff like cosmetics or bragging rights. But just like the element of how wipes don’t respect the time of many players, giving those that complete Projects an advantage would also be a problem for those same players. I suspect that player group is larger than those that want an advantage for completing a Project.

There are lots of details to be felt out, and there will be questions about how fast and effectively new projects can be brought in.

I am sure this will be ironed out, and this is part of the reason they do preview events for new maps. We had the same issue with Coral Divide when it was previewed, and it was fixed up pretty well by the time it fully launched.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The map layout is confusing at first, but the more I played the more comfortable I was with it. It is similar to the Coral Divide map, where there are many avenues to move around in, yet you almost always end up at a choke point. With that said, I can see the map being challenging for more casual players, and I think the layout has definitely caused some players to get lost and miss out on contributing to the match. There are some choke-point areas near the spawns, so I\'ve seen a good bit of spawn camping in lopsided matches. If they do a pass to clean up clutter, I think they can also do some work to create more varied paths out of spawn.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ7hS1YNwJqD09ZKYVtK1RbZB3AO6ffHa07It3lkTP6TGpsvXpkjOeYomZm3Ng53H9OwVphmI6lG3y7nSjkcu2G1RlLxGCz36INoTmDE8jD11awuyqlEofP9tUe-5jKg5fb-XpV8PrkscZLVTYOPa_qz1uNjcwtl_aFArGliCpznndOXWqQrOyQA/s1901/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-25-25%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ7hS1YNwJqD09ZKYVtK1RbZB3AO6ffHa07It3lkTP6TGpsvXpkjOeYomZm3Ng53H9OwVphmI6lG3y7nSjkcu2G1RlLxGCz36INoTmDE8jD11awuyqlEofP9tUe-5jKg5fb-XpV8PrkscZLVTYOPa_qz1uNjcwtl_aFArGliCpznndOXWqQrOyQA/w640-h360/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-25-25%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Jump pad on the right.&nbsp; Another look at the map.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Jump pads have also been introduced to OPR; previously, they were only used on the capture the flag maps. Players can hold the jump button down on a pad and be vaulted in a specific direction. Most often this is to jump over a gap or to go up a level vertically. They are not required, as many areas have other means of traversal to the same spots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The jump pads were fun at first, but I am not sure I like them. They are inconsistent, and numerous times the pad never activated and I fell into a gap, or the direction/length of the jump differed from my expectation based on prior interactions. Even if the consistency issue was ironed out, there are other aspects I dislike about the pads. They lead to wonky combat scenarios, with players using the pads as a form of dodge instead of their intended traversal mechanism. Credit to the players who can use them to shake and bake in a fight, but for my taste I\'d prefer they weren\'t there. New World combat is already full of dodges and speed; there doesn\'t need to be more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;One thing I really like about the layout is how the gathering nodes are positioned. Trees are next to the side outposts and are clustered together—no more epic journeys across the map to get a pile of wood for building gates and tents. Similarly, the ore is concentrated in the caverns below the castle in close proximity. A quick trip into the catacombs nets a large pile. The closer positioning means faster gathering, which means faster upgrades. If you are a player, like me, who fancies building up the outpost defenses, you don\'t feel like you have to avoid the entire match to do so. I spent a good bit of time in my matches building up the outposts and at the same time still getting into the fights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As far as balance goes, the matches I\'ve been in spanned the gamut—from one-sided stomps (1000 to 13 in one bad example) all the way to nail-biters (1000–997, one of the closest matches I\'ve ever been in). As it\'s a new map, it\'s hard to judge what factors into a team’s success, as many players are still adapting, but it does feel like the map layout lends itself to players getting distracted from the control points and strung along in fights elsewhere. Not fighting on the points is a sure way to lose them. This is nothing unique to this map, though, so it\'s hard to say for sure.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdorlGb6cozY_G4fRiKiuySpXYLyBTLGd2HElBulW-1Oa-JIQ1MogtXthMo4xH3lUMT_IAifFgyZsFwvOGnlvsq9lCr0aJvK7j8-atXOU1yUJWg3GfJ9xMvgZEpZ4CzydrWi7WFkKpN-j0Iw1s_5w7uxJrTxXshBw6L8q0XUeIKUGLQSeT-tjfqA/s2560/20250925015432_1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdorlGb6cozY_G4fRiKiuySpXYLyBTLGd2HElBulW-1Oa-JIQ1MogtXthMo4xH3lUMT_IAifFgyZsFwvOGnlvsq9lCr0aJvK7j8-atXOU1yUJWg3GfJ9xMvgZEpZ4CzydrWi7WFkKpN-j0Iw1s_5w7uxJrTxXshBw6L8q0XUeIKUGLQSeT-tjfqA/w640-h360/20250925015432_1.jpg" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Holy cow that was a nail biter 1000-997!&nbsp; And I made 4th over all on my team (blue)!</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Some early feedback I read worried the map favored range over melee. While there are sniping positions, such as the second story above the main capture point and the ledges around the castle, there are plenty of places for melee to shine. In my heavy flamethrower build, which is effectively melee range, I rarely felt like I was just a sitting duck for pot shots. I had plenty of cover to navigate around, and I could push ranged players without feeling like it was just empty space between us. Yes, there are certain times where matches got sideways and camping sets in, which is why I mentioned earlier some adjustments to the spawn areas and how players flow into the map from them would help.</p><p>&nbsp;Overall, I like the map. I like the theme and the many nooks and crannies to explore while looking for a fight. I would like to see some cleanup of the visual and ground clutter, and I think a swipe at adjustments to the spawn areas would help. I\'d also like to see the jump pads reduced so there are fewer overall, but I am fine if they remain as is. I am looking forward to this map making the regular rotation.</p><p></p><p><i>Note: this post was edited with the help of AI (ChatGPT).

We had the same issue with Coral Divide when it was previewed, and it was fixed up pretty well by the time it fully launched.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The map layout is confusing at first, but the more I played the more comfortable I was with it. It is similar to the Coral Divide map, where there are many avenues to move around in, yet you almost always end up at a choke point. With that said, I can see the map being challenging for more casual players, and I think the layout has definitely caused some players to get lost and miss out on contributing to the match. There are some choke-point areas near the spawns, so I\'ve seen a good bit of spawn camping in lopsided matches. If they do a pass to clean up clutter, I think they can also do some work to create more varied paths out of spawn.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ7hS1YNwJqD09ZKYVtK1RbZB3AO6ffHa07It3lkTP6TGpsvXpkjOeYomZm3Ng53H9OwVphmI6lG3y7nSjkcu2G1RlLxGCz36INoTmDE8jD11awuyqlEofP9tUe-5jKg5fb-XpV8PrkscZLVTYOPa_qz1uNjcwtl_aFArGliCpznndOXWqQrOyQA/s1901/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-25-25%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ7hS1YNwJqD09ZKYVtK1RbZB3AO6ffHa07It3lkTP6TGpsvXpkjOeYomZm3Ng53H9OwVphmI6lG3y7nSjkcu2G1RlLxGCz36INoTmDE8jD11awuyqlEofP9tUe-5jKg5fb-XpV8PrkscZLVTYOPa_qz1uNjcwtl_aFArGliCpznndOXWqQrOyQA/w640-h360/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-25-25%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Jump pad on the right.&nbsp; Another look at the map.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Jump pads have also been introduced to OPR; previously, they were only used on the capture the flag maps. Players can hold the jump button down on a pad and be vaulted in a specific direction. Most often this is to jump over a gap or to go up a level vertically. They are not required, as many areas have other means of traversal to the same spots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The jump pads were fun at first, but I am not sure I like them. They are inconsistent, and numerous times the pad never activated and I fell into a gap, or the direction/length of the jump differed from my expectation based on prior interactions. Even if the consistency issue was ironed out, there are other aspects I dislike about the pads. They lead to wonky combat scenarios, with players using the pads as a form of dodge instead of their intended traversal mechanism. Credit to the players who can use them to shake and bake in a fight, but for my taste I\'d prefer they weren\'t there. New World combat is already full of dodges and speed; there doesn\'t need to be more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;One thing I really like about the layout is how the gathering nodes are positioned. Trees are next to the side outposts and are clustered together—no more epic journeys across the map to get a pile of wood for building gates and tents. Similarly, the ore is concentrated in the caverns below the castle in close proximity. A quick trip into the catacombs nets a large pile. The closer positioning means faster gathering, which means faster upgrades. If you are a player, like me, who fancies building up the outpost defenses, you don\'t feel like you have to avoid the entire match to do so. I spent a good bit of time in my matches building up the outposts and at the same time still getting into the fights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As far as balance goes, the matches I\'ve been in spanned the gamut—from one-sided stomps (1000 to 13 in one bad example) all the way to nail-biters (1000–997, one of the closest matches I\'ve ever been in). As it\'s a new map, it\'s hard to judge what factors into a team’s success, as many players are still adapting, but it does feel like the map layout lends itself to players getting distracted from the control points and strung along in fights elsewhere. Not fighting on the points is a sure way to lose them. This is nothing unique to this map, though, so it\'s hard to say for sure.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdorlGb6cozY_G4fRiKiuySpXYLyBTLGd2HElBulW-1Oa-JIQ1MogtXthMo4xH3lUMT_IAifFgyZsFwvOGnlvsq9lCr0aJvK7j8-atXOU1yUJWg3GfJ9xMvgZEpZ4CzydrWi7WFkKpN-j0Iw1s_5w7uxJrTxXshBw6L8q0XUeIKUGLQSeT-tjfqA/s2560/20250925015432_1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdorlGb6cozY_G4fRiKiuySpXYLyBTLGd2HElBulW-1Oa-JIQ1MogtXthMo4xH3lUMT_IAifFgyZsFwvOGnlvsq9lCr0aJvK7j8-atXOU1yUJWg3GfJ9xMvgZEpZ4CzydrWi7WFkKpN-j0Iw1s_5w7uxJrTxXshBw6L8q0XUeIKUGLQSeT-tjfqA/w640-h360/20250925015432_1.jpg" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Holy cow that was a nail biter 1000-997!&nbsp; And I made 4th over all on my team (blue)!</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Some early feedback I read worried the map favored range over melee. While there are sniping positions, such as the second story above the main capture point and the ledges around the castle, there are plenty of places for melee to shine. In my heavy flamethrower build, which is effectively melee range, I rarely felt like I was just a sitting duck for pot shots. I had plenty of cover to navigate around, and I could push ranged players without feeling like it was just empty space between us. Yes, there are certain times where matches got sideways and camping sets in, which is why I mentioned earlier some adjustments to the spawn areas and how players flow into the map from them would help.</p><p>&nbsp;Overall, I like the map. I like the theme and the many nooks and crannies to explore while looking for a fight. I would like to see some cleanup of the visual and ground clutter, and I think a swipe at adjustments to the spawn areas would help. I\'d also like to see the jump pads reduced so there are fewer overall, but I am fine if they remain as is. I am looking forward to this map making the regular rotation.</p><p></p><p><i>Note: this post was edited with the help of AI (ChatGPT).

I\'m quite overlevelled of course. The story of the game overall was a bit underwhelming, but I liked the references to the original game and it wasn\'t bad per se. The best parts of the game are taken from the first game in general, but I can\'t deny it has kept my attention for this long.</p>\n<p>I don\'t know if I\'ll bother getting the two combat jobs that I haven\'t levelled at all up to Hero. It means a lot of grinding of mooks. I prefer just playing the jobs I can do on muscle memory. But now I have most of the Ginormosia areas up to rank 5 I have access to a lot more rare enemies and materials without having to go back down into the dungeons, which are so annoying to get in and out of. Today I finally saw a gold crown sheep enemy that drops a type of fleece that I need for my hero crafting.  So I\'m getting there. While I grind I\'m making an effort to get as many comrades up to full hearts as possible, it doesn\'t seem completely impossible.</p>\n<p>Based on what I read about the post-game content I\'m going to need to kill a lot of shadow enemies to get drops from them and there\'s two main ways to do that: the fortress or the treasure groves. The fortress means guaranteed spawns, the treasure grove means getting more other stuff at the same time. I have a necklace with item drop+ on it, but I need to try to make some more other stuff with that skill on it as well to make best use of my time. I might need some more of those remake cube currency things.</p>\n<p>I also know that I need to get the shadow energy balls dropping from shadow enemies to unlock the gates throughout the game. It\'s going to be annoying going back through every dungeon to find them all. I wish this game had a "repel spray" item or the dragon quest mechanic of weak enemies running away from you. Even if you can totally ignore them and they don\'t do any damage hitting you it\'s still annoying.</p>\n<p>I hadn\'t even touched the treasure groves before finishing the story, so I\'ve only made it down to floor 200 now (each floor goes by 10 so it\'s not as much as it sounds). I thought I probably would have to grind all the way down until I got to the level 50 layer to find anything good, but I\'ve already had ultra-rare materials spawn at level 20-30. Maybe it\'s because I\'m already level 70-ish in all my combat/gathering lives? But I\'m very happy to finally see some Magic Ore. I still haven\'t even seen any in Ginormosia.</p>\n<p>It\'s annoying that the Encyclopaedia in-game isn\'t super comprehensive. It mostly only shows you the first place you can find something. It still might be available elsewhere. And all the wikis/walkthroughs these days are bloated and ugly, even with quite strict ad-blocking you have to spend ages to find out one fact. The title of the page will be like "Location of Magic Ore" and then you have to scroll multiple times to find the single line of text that tells you where it is. The rest is just junk. And then you have to check somewhere else to confirm and they disagree. Argh.</p>\n<p>So when I play now my tasks are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy more shadow carrot seeds.</li>\n<li>Plant seeds and water.</li>\n<li>Go to Ginormosia and finish levelling areas to rank 5.</li>\n<li>Check for good legendary spawns and do those.</li>\n<li>Clear the first floor of the fortress for shadow enemies.</li>\n<li>Go back and check on the seeds to water them again.</li>\n<li>Do a treasure grove run.</li>\n<li>Turn in the shadow slate things for recipes.</li>\n<li>Restock veggies at stands and find merchants to spend acorns on rare materials and new recipes.</li>\n<li>Collect Celestia flowers.</li>\n<li>Check on the gallery (because it affects the island rank up).</li>\n<li>See what new things I can craft now that I have a few more new materials – I especially want to get at least one more legendary tool going.</li>\n<li>Talk to the Plundering Jaguar for upgrades to the legendary equipment.</li>\n<li>Craft some more food and potions.</li>\n<li>Harvest vegetables.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I guess I\'ll keep playing as long as I\'ve still got TV to watch while playing it. I\'m sure my brain will just turn off it suddenly at some point, as it does.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 2\xa0days, 15\xa0hours ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-13-bearblog-theme-css-v10" title="Bearblog Theme CSS v10">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Beat the game story, still grinding up Ginormosia, killing shadow enemies, and venturing into Treasure Groves.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-13-fantasy-life-i-140-hrs-update/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Beat the game story, still grinding up Ginormosia, killing shadow enemies, and venturing into Treasure Groves.'}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'fantasy life i', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'video games', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-13T20:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=13, tm_hour=20, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=286, tm_isdst=0)}

It also generates a few more hex codes that are used within the Radix theme and extra colours for wide-gamut screens, but I stripped those out.</p>\n<p>Part of the appeal of using a semi-pre-made palette like this is that Radix has already done contrast checking and <a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/understanding-the-scale">tells you straight up what colours to use for what parts of the UI</a>. I didn\'t 100% adhere to it, but it was good for having a guide so I didn\'t spend all day trying every possible combination. So for e.g. violet-1 and 2 are for backgrounds and violet 11 and 12 are for text.</p>\n<p>I also didn\'t actually use the scale itself in the css, I copied and pasted the values into my own naming scheme, which I may end up regretting.

I\'m just going to leave them as is for now.</p>\n<p>I\'m not entirely satisfied with how it turned out, it\'s a bit <em>too</em> monochrome now, but I feel better having a solid base to work off of. It would be nice to have multiple "button" colours depending on the actual button\'s purpose and I\'m not entirely happy with the link styling either. But we\'ll see.</p>\n<h2 id="font-sizes">Font Sizes</h2><p>I\'ve been using clamp-based responsive font sizes <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-08-25-bearblog-theme-css-update/#font-sizes">for a while</a>, but the smaller font sizes are a bit too small on mobile. So I adjusted those. They\'re still pretty close to what they were nobody will probably notice the difference much.

id="mark-and-code">Mark and Code</h2><p>Added styling for <code>mark</code> and <code>code</code> html elements. I haven\'t actually used mark to highlight anything yet but I might want to? And code is for small bits of code in-line with text of course.</p>\n<h2 id="suffering-with-accordions">Suffering With Accordions</h2><p>I\'ve tried out the <code>details</code> tag and it seems good for truncating long text in the middle or end of a post. Most of the other css-only code snippets I found for the purposes of collapsing long text were more focused on full-on accordion menus or truncating long text into a modal window type thing. I don\'t want to have to make a whole elaborate thing that I\'ll have to copy and paste into a post every time I want to use it. So I thought for the purposes of posts like this where I\'m going to include a long block of text I\'m going to stick with <code>details</code> until it becomes a problem.</p>\n<p>The HTML looks like:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">details</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">summary</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Text that goes on the button<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">summary</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\nThe text you want to hide<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">details</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n<p>You can style it differently depending on if its open or closed and you can change the little arrow marker like it was a list marker.</p>\n<p>But then of course when I actually tried it to collapse a long piece of code the Markdown fenced code block doesn\'t render. So I tried to make the same kind of code block that markdown renders by hand in just html and now I don\'t have syntax highlighting any more. Because there aren\'t the bazillion little <code>span</code>s to target. 😩 So yeah I guess it\'s one or the other unless I figure out something else.</p>\n<h2 id="full-theme-code">Full Theme

I\'m not doing anything special for it, other than watch the Blue Jays. Canadian Thanksgiving doesn\'t have quite the same colonialist trappings as the US version, even when I was a kid it was just a harvest festival that had nothing to do with the subjugation of indigenous people. I don\'t know if they teach more indigeneity around the holiday in schools now. It was my favourite holiday as a teenager because unlike all the other official school holidays or my birthday it didn\'t have any negative memories associated with it and I got to eat good food made by my relatives. The fact that my parents can\'t cook beyond boiling things or heating things up in the microwave is well known in my extended family. Just being able to have homemade food, including apple pie for dessert, made the forced socializing worthwhile. Unfortunately I cannot see the point of cooking for one and apples now extremely reliably give me IBS cramps. 😭</p>\n<div class="toc">\n<h2 class="toc-head">Contents:</h2>\n<ol class="toc-list"><li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#reading">Reading</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#watching">Watching</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#listening">Listening</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#playing">Playing</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#living">Living</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#bookmarking">Bookmarking</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><h3 id="emmurder-at-the-black-cat-cafeem-by-seishi-yokomizo"><em>Murder at the Black Cat Café</em> by Seishi Yokomizo</h3><p>I did finally read it the night before it was due back at the library. 😅 It was disappointingly short because even though it is a slim book to begin with it\'s actually two totally separate novellas rather than one, and the second one isn\'t listed anywhere on the front or back cover. It\'s a nice cover design, but confusing choice by the publisher. The second story is "Why the Well Wheel Creaked" and actually is much more emotionally moving and scary than the main one. But they both hinge on the mystery trope of a dual identity.</p>\n<p>There is something calming or satisfying about Yokomizo\'s stories, they\'re always perfectly complete puzzles. There might be lots of red herrings, false alibis, and multiple suspects, but at the end when you find out the solution from Kindaichi you don\'t feel tricked but rather that it was perfectly put together. The first story feels like it could have been drawn out to at least small novel length; if you read it right through as I did you won\'t have time to really try to come up with a solution by yourself unless you\'re very disciplined and stop midway on purpose. Unfortunately, one black cat does die. :(</p>\n<p>The second story is on a theme that Yokomizo has touched on before with Gokumon Island: soldiers returning changed from the war. The history of a rural noble family is told and their conflicts with other local families and you can see with the set-up what is probably going to happen, but the way the story unravels in epistolic form with a signature Yokomizo twist is still tragic and horrifying.

It wouldn\'t replace the original because part of the appeal of the original is that it\'s just normal everyday people participating and these are all people who have public personas and know how to act for a camera.

However, some manga are entirely focused on the game, whereas in others the game is simply a single story arc or secondary to other genres. It could be defined as situations where a group of people are isolated and forced to play games with deadly consequences. Sometimes the consequences are financial, but usually with the implication that this person is going to be so financially ruined by losing that they might as well be dead.</p>\n<p>Most people know of it from Hunger Games, Squid Games, Danganronpa, or maybe the OG classic that popularized the style: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_%28novel%29">Battle Royale</a>. Japanese media didn\'t invent the "trap a bunch of people and make them play games to survive" idea, but in the 00s and 10s it seems to have captured the feeling of the time and they sure ran with it. It has since been superseded in popularity with edgy teens by isekai.</p>\n<p>These manga tend to be shelved as shounen (teen boys) or seinen (adult men) in the "Survival" category as well as "Psychological Horror" or "Thriller", but they vary in tone.</p>\n<h3 id="meta-analysis">Meta Analysis</h3><p>The trope is, in my opinion, mostly a representation of both the anxieties of teens, for whom every school day can feel like a life or death struggle, and the financial anxieties of adults in a punishing capitalist system with a firm social hierarchy. It particularly legitimizes the feelings of teenagers, who are experiencing the hightened emotions of puberty combined with being forced to attend school and obey adults even when they are being cruel or irrational. Navigating the social nuances of high school may not <em>literally</em> be life or death, but it sure feels like it. It provides a fantasy of being the one person capable of breaking the oppressive system, the person who is different from all the others, while also justifying violence as a necessary evil to survive the game. It\'s finally fine to kill that annoying co-worker and rebel against your boss and you will be hailed as a hero for doing it!</p>\n<p>It usually investigates themes of despair and hope, trust and friendship, meritocracy vs kleptocracy, survival of the fittest vs supporting the weak, and harsh truths vs the masks we wear every day. Most authors tend towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellum_omnium_contra_omnes">a Hobbsian view</a> where at the end of the day people will do anything to survive and the base nature of humanity is selfishness and competition. However there is often a "if we try really hard to trust each other we can overcome our base instincts and succeed" message i.e. build "civilization" as a bulwark against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature?useskin=vector#Thomas_Hobbes">"state of nature"</a> being forced on the players by the game. In many of the longer stories, the "players" uprising in revolution against the "game masters" is a key story arc, however it is usually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary">reactionary</a> revolution, attempting to return to an idealized prior existence.</p>\n<p>It is narratively a really convenient way to put a bunch of people who wouldn\'t normally interact into highly emotional over the top situations. Much like the traditional Agatha Christie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_circle_of_suspects">closed circle murder mystery</a>. It also allows the author to explore ideas of "human nature" while excusing quite a lot of extreme behaviour that would be outside the norm, both in terms of violence and sex. The structure of having games with rules and phases of play also provides a ready-made narrative structure and provides predictable story beats.</p>\n<h3 id="the-stereotypical-death-game">The Stereotypical Death Game</h3><p>Sometimes the games are gambling-related, sometimes they\'re logic puzzles, sometimes they\'re a forced dilemma, sometimes they are innocuous children\'s games – that was actually a super over-done trope well before Squid Games got there, which is why I was kind of baffled by it being heralded as innovative and genius by Western media reviewers. Death games can be more cerebral, and focused on logical thinking, psychology, deduction, and manipulation or more physical and focused on violence, combat, or survival in a harsh environment, but usually it\'s a mix of both.</p>\n<p>Protagonists are often quiet but smart "unassuming" male high schoolers or young adults, but they are sometimes adults. Female protagonists are pretty rare. There is usually quite a lot of gore and quite a lot of fanservice. Sometimes the protagonist is a Good Guy who wants to Win Through Friendship, but more often he is an anti-hero master manipulator logical thinker who has a heart of gold.</p>\n<p>The shorter manga usually have a smaller set of characters who are forced into playing one game together and thereby revealing lots of things about them and their backstory. The longer ones inevitably end up with many more characters both joining the protagonist\'s team and fighting against them. They also necessarily have many more games, which means they often over-stay their welcome as the author has to beat <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfEscalatingThreat">the Dragon Ball problem</a> of ever-increasing challenges for the protagonist to overcome while also justifying why the protagonist is even there at all. Which is hard when you\'ve already established a standard where losing is death and people desperately want out of the game.</p>\n<h2 id="wtf-is-the-traitors">WTF is The Traitors</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Traitors_%28British_TV_series%29">The Traitors</a> is a reality tv show originating with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Verraders">the Dutch</a>, but after it was franchised to the BBC in the UK hit worldwide popularity. It has finished its third series and has just started a first Celebrity Traitors series which will hopefully be very revealing. The host is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Winkleman">Claudia Winkleman</a> who acts as narrator and shepherds the contestants through their tasks.</p>\n<p>The premise of The Traitors is 22-ish normal people are taken to a castle in the Scottish Highlands. These are notably not influencers, B-list celebs, or reality tv regulars. Some of them will be secretly selected to be Traitors who can than "murder" other members. The non-traitors are called Faithful and they must choose to banish someone every day in the hopes of banishing a traitor and saving themselves. At the end of the game if one or more traitors are included in the final group of winners they will take the whole prize pot and the faithful get nothing. To add to the stress during the day the group go on "missions" that are usually elaborate team bonding exercises and they must work as a group regardless of suspicions in order to increase the prize pot.</p>\n<p>So it\'s basically a variation on mafia, wink murder, or werewolf game. You have to decide who you trust and then coordinate on who you will remove from the game without becoming suspected or targeted yourself.</p>\n<p>One of my first criticisms of the show when I started watching with Series 3 is that the missions were kids summer camp level difficulty. There was zero intellectual challenge and while there were more physically intensive missions there was never any risk of losing all the money or anyone being knocked out of the game. I thought they were basically impossible to fail – and then I watched series 2 where some of the missions were a bit more complicated and the teams very nearly failed almost all of them. (And I suspect in some cases the producers gave them a pass on some cheating or gave them some extra time to ensure they finished.) So I was under-whelmed by the actual level of jeopardy people were in, even if it was entirely fictional.</p>\n<p>This show is an excellent insight into how unrealistic most death game manga are -- it clearly demonstrates that 90% of people involved in a real death game would panic, rely on "gut instinct", and follow the herd. And the remaining 10% who come in familiar with logic puzzles and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame">wargames</a> tend to fail miserably at rallying the group around actual legitimate strategy and get voted out for being too smart and too calm. It\'s honestly an awful format for so many reasons, but certainly entertaining.</p>\n<h2 id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>For the purpose of this list I\'m mostly focused on the manga with a strong trust/lying element rather than the ones that are mostly about combat battle royales or which have a fantasy/sci-fi setting. As someone who has been around the genre for a while I feel these are all obvious and popular recs, so if you have already read all of these, sorry.</p>\n<p>The best death game manga still tend to be kind of… bad. This is popcorn reading. The art tends to be not very exciting and the stories tend to be formulaic. The protagonists even look pretty much interchangeable most of the time. It is extremely difficult to find one with an actually satisfying ending (don\'t even get me started on Gantz) so quitting partway through is valid. These are recommendations of ones that managed to hold my attention for one reason or another.</p>\n<p>There is almost always discussion or depiction of torture, violence, gruesome deaths, gore, animal cruelty, rape, sexual assault used for comedy, child abuse, slavery, suicide, abusive relationships, drug use, alcohol use, gambling, blackmail, participation in cults, etc etc.</p>\n<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2><h3 id="jinrou-game">Jinrou Game / 人狼ゲーム</h3><p>Kawakami Ryou & Koudon (2014, Takeshobo)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A manga cover of a young woman with light brown hair and glasses in a ripped sailor fuku covered in blood with her arms above her head as they transform into a bronze skulls.

Very gory, lots of T&amp;A. But very similar set-up to The Traitors. A bunch of teenagers are kidnapped and trapped together. There are two werewolves (jinrou) and the rest are villagers. The werewolves must kill someone every night, the villagers must vote for someone to be killed every day, and then kill them with their own hands. If they refuse to participate they are killed. Whichever side kills all of the others wins. However these people realize they are all actually connected somehow. And, rare in this space, the ending is pretty good. There are some sequels but I haven\'t read them.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 7/10</p>\n<h3 id="liar-game">Liar Game</h3><p>Kaitani Shinobu (2005, Shueisha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A brightly coloured image with three people layered on top of each other.

When the game ends, in 30 days, you will have to return your 100 million. If your opponent steals them, he can keep them as a prize, and you will have a debt of 100 million…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Long, 200 chapters. Unlike a lot of these, there is almost no physical violence. While the participants are manipulated into joining the game, they are also given multiple opportunities to back out. It is fundamentally a story about greed and trust, much like The Traitors. The protagonist is a young naïve woman who gets sucked in to the game by trusting the wrong person. She meets a professional con artist fresh out of jail who agrees to participate with her in exchange for half the winnings. She develops over the course of the manga into a more life-savvy character and he reveals deeper motives than just cash. The characters in this are fun and while the games are often based on logic puzzles they aren\'t just about finding a solution, they\'re usually also about persuading or manipulating the other players. It\'s honestly a good overview of a lot of ways in which people are conned or pressured into making bad decisions in real life. There is even a trans woman character that shows up partway through who, for once, isn\'t a caricature. The first volume is quite a good representation of how the rest goes, but if you think Nao is annoying she gets better I promise. The ending isn\'t great, the plot does peter out somewhat, but the games are well structured and it focuses on real-world psychology rather than going for shock value.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>\n<h3 id="tomodachi-game">Tomodachi Game / トモダチゲーム</h3><p>Yamaguchi Mikoto & Satou Yuki (2014, Kodansha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A young Japanese man wearing a black parka is reaching towards the camera with narrow brown eyes and shaggy black hair.

Could they have stolen the money from class to pay for entry into the game? Katagiri and his best friends will have to succeed in psychological games that will test or destroy their faith in one another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Very Long, 249 chapters. One of the manga that is explicitly about friends betraying each other, with games designed to split people apart. If you like Death Note you\'ll like this, there is a lot of thinking by the genius anti-hero protagonist and then "Nani?!" reveals. If you actually want to try to solve puzzles or mysteries along with the players you probably won\'t enjoy this one as much. The art quality gets better as you go along, but the story gets repetitive and also the female characters\' breasts keep getting mysteriously bigger. There is some violence and involves more outdoors survival phases, but there is less outright shock gore.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 7/10</p>\n<h3 id="as-the-gods-will">As The Gods Will / 神さまの言うとおり</h3><p>Kaneshiro Muneyuki & Fujimura Akeji (2011, Kodansha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A very orange and yellow heavily sylized drawing with a young man reaching towards the camera with one hand and holding two cards in his left.

Yep, it was doing Squid Game 10 years before Squid Game, but with mostly high schoolers. As an interesting twist, the death games are something that is happening out in normal society, where everyone can see it, not in a locked dungeon somewhere. The protagonist is a "normal guy" who rises to the death game occasion, turns out to have a special ability, and builds a team to win. Decent character development. Has a very comedic/absurd style, but isn\'t scared of introducing characters and then immediately killing them off, which I always respect. Lots of girls with big boobs and typical shounen sex comedy. The ending isn\'t actually an ending, there is a direct sequel that leads to the actual conclusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 6/10</p>\n<h3 id="alice-in-borderland">Alice in Borderland / 今際の国のアリス</h3><p>Asou Haro (2010, Shogakugan)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A monochrome magenta stylized image of a naked woman who is seated with long hair covering her body and one eye is white.

Perhaps more well known because it was made into a Netflix drama. The protagonist is a typical teen guy, but unlike a lot of the other death game manga contains a lot of adult characters. The mix of ages is more like The Traitors, and the need for teamwork to get through the missions. While there is a fair bit of T&amp;A and some gags I think this is one of the better ones in terms of serious character writing. There are certainly more female characters that aren\'t just sex objects. The games also tend to have more depth and a trick to them. However it definitely went on too long and the ending was just never going to be satisfying.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>\n<h3 id="usogui">Usogui / 嘘喰い</h3><p>Sako Toshio (2006, Shueisha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="The POV is underneath an invisible platform that the character is standing on.

But to secure the integrity of these life-threatening gambles, a violent and powerful organization by the name of “Kakerou” referees these games as a neutral party. Follow Baku Madarame a.k.a. Usogui (The Lie Eater) as he gambles against maniacal opponents at games – such as Escape the Abandoned Building, Old Maid, and Hangman – to ultimately “out-gamble” and control the neutral organization of Kakerou itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saving the best for last. God, I wish it would get licensed and released in deluxe omnibus volumes. This manga is not really much like The Traitors, as most of the games in it are one on one or a small group against another small group, but it is very much about psychological manipulation. Also it is one of my all-time favourites so I have to give it a plug.</p>\n<p>However it is a very particular flavour that you will either love or hate. It combines the "punching people so hard they explode" of ultra-macho martial arts (<em>Fist of the North Star</em> is a strong inspiration) with extremely strong logic puzzles and plotting as the protagonist, Madarame Baku, bets his life on games.</p>\n<p>The characters are extremely memorable and the art is stylish, sometimes making characters look smooth and beautiful and sometimes making them look grotesque and terrifying. Most of these death game manga have a separate writer and artist because it\'s honestly very rare to find someone who can draw action scenes so effectively while also writing such a complex story. All the games are very "fair play", the reader is given all the clues necessary to determine the correct strategy or solution, and they are all extremely original. This very much isn\'t a character-driven story, but some of the character backstories can be surprisingly touching and emotional.</p>\n<p>Madarame Baku, the protagonist and titular "lie eater", isn\'t a self-insert character. Unlike a lot of death games, this isn\'t a story of a normal guy becoming a leader, or someone unfamiliar with a situation figuring out how to survive, this is the story of a world-class athlete going up against other seasoned winners, who are all complete maniacs, while the games are supervised by "referees" who provide the violence necessary to keep the games fair. The main appeal as a reader isn\'t just in watching Usogui win, it\'s in figuring out <em>how</em> he will win. What Usogui is actually up to, and why he is making these gambles, is slowly revealed and the story culminates after 540 chapters and 49 volumes in one final gamble that perfectly pulls all the storylines together. At no point does this manga slow down or get repetitive.</p>\n<p>There are some female referees, but there are very few female characters overall. Honestly, I think it\'s more honest not to have a token empty love interest character. However even though this manga doesn\'t go for cheap shock gore or lots of sexual content it feels like the horniest of the ones I\'ve listed here just because of how borderline erotic and intense the gambling and combat scenes are.</p>\n<p>The first chapter isn\'t a good introduction as it was originally written as a one-shot and some things were changed after the fact, but if you get through the first "Abandoned Building Game" storyline across the first two volumes it only gets better from there. <small>P.S. Marco is Best Boy and must be protected at all costs.</small></p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 10/10</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 3\xa0days, 1\xa0hour ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-08-making-tea" title="Making Tea">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-12-oct-week-2-digest" title="Oct Week 2 Digest">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'An overview of the death game trope, The Traitors tv show, and a rec list of manga with a similar premise.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-11-the-traitors-death-game-manga/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'An overview of the death game trope, The Traitors tv show, and a rec list of manga with a similar premise.'}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'manga', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'reading', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'review', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'the traitors', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'tv', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-11T15:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=11, tm_hour=15, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=5, tm_yday=284, tm_isdst=0)}

Which means it\'s time to start drinking more tea to keep my body and hands warm. Unfortunately, last year the motor burnt out on my long-serving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_water_boiler">hot water dispenser</a>. I bought it back in 2016 or so and aside from the year I was couchsurfing I\'ve been using it ever since. I drink less hot tea in the summer and boiling a kettle to make a pot of iced tea isn\'t that big of a deal. But now that I\'m back to continuously chaining large mugs of tea throughout the day I really notice it\'s absence.</p>\n<p>I\'m not big on "life hacking" per se the way it was popularized among nerds in the 2000s and 2010s, but I <em>am</em> interested in accommodations. I want to make life as easy for myself as possible. This means limiting wasted time, limiting the distance from a to b, removing unnecessary steps, making things I don\'t like doing convenient. I think I\'ve been doing this so long I have a hard time understanding people who <em>don\'t</em> do this. It\'s so sad to see people struggling unnecessarily with ideas of how things are Supposed to be done. And I really, really have a hard time living or working with or under people who insist there is One Correct Way to do things. I don\'t even like internet arguments over trivial things like how you\'re "supposed" to fold towels or whatever where people get mock outraged over other people doing things differently. When you\'ve lived with as many strangers as I have you have to have an open mind.</p>\n<p>All that to say, I drink a lot of tea. And so I am highly incentivized to make the process of making and drinking tea as smooth as possible. I think it\'s a good example of self-accommodation so that the world aligns with how my brain works rather than trying to make my brain fit into what the world considers standard.</p>\n<p>I didn\'t descale it often enough and our water here is super hard so even though I was running the water through a Brita filter before putting it in the motor got clogged and burnt out. I was able to diagnose the issue and even found a youtube video of someone taking apart a model very similar to mine to clean it, but I couldn\'t get into the motor, there was too much wiring and zipties in the way. I was going to take it to get repaired at a free repair café thing run periodically by one of the community organizations here, but you basically have to bring your thing there in the morning and wait in line and hope they will have time for you. So I never got up the energy to do it. Especially with the high chance the motor has burnt itself out and would need to be fully replaced. I\'m having a hard time justifying the expense of replacing it when using a kettle is Fine, I Guess, but now that winter is coming… It\'s less than two full price Switch games… (~$120 CAD for a decent 2L capacity Panasonic, $200 for a low end Zojirushi, $350 for a high end Zojirushi).</p>\n<details>Aside This is a test of the html details tag. This is one of those situations where I feel like I\'m bad at being poor. I\'m keenly aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory">Vimes Boot Theory</a> and my mother was an accountant so I am financially educated. I\'ll cut back on a lot of stuff and be really nitpicky about a dollar here or there with some things (I read four different grocery flyers every week to price compare), but with other things I\'ll put down "too much" money to get a decent product rather than just get by with the basic shit. Fundamentally, I don\'t think suffering is a virtue. </details>\n<p>So we\'re back to using the electric kettle, which feels like going back to the stone age. If you drink multiple cups of tea a day in your household and you have the money I would highly recommend getting a hot water dispenser. Like rice cookers, they are extremely common in Asian and Indian households, but most white people haven\'t caught on yet. When I\'ve met white Canadians who even know what I\'m talking about it\'s "oh we had one of those in our office". Even white Brits, famous for being tea drinkers, seem to consider them an absurd luxury rather than a normal kitchen appliance like a microwave.</p>\n<p>It\'s a simple technology. It\'s a heating coil under an urn and a temperature sensor and when the temperature of the water is below the sensor\'s set temperature it re-boils the water and then shuts off again. Then you press a button and hot water is pushed out by a small motor. The simplest ones are practically analog, you just push down on the top to use water displacement to force the water out (physics!). The simplest digital ones, like the one I had, have a button to push to set the temperature to one of three presets so if you don\'t actually want 100ºC like me you can set it to a more reasonable 80 or 90 and not scald yourself (and ruin your tea).</p>\n<p>If you use a kettle and think it\'s not that big of a deal to refill it and reboil it manually all day, I promise you it\'s life-changing. While I don\'t mind the ritual of having to go and boil a kettle and wait for it when I\'m working in an office (and therefore wasting time is essential to making it through the day), at home I want to get up and get more tea without losing my train of thought or having to go afk on FFXIV. With the hot water dispenser I could get up to refill my tea in the amount of time it takes Gaius to do his speech and have time left over.</p>\n<p>So going back to the self-accommodation, since this is something I do 10 times a day I want to make the process as smooth and thoughtless as possible.</p>\n<p>The kettle/hot water boiler is on the counter so I can reach it from the kitchen or the living room. With the water boiler I had a saucer under it to catch drips, with the kettle I keep a saucer next to it for putting used tea bags on. I also have a decorative bowl on the coffee table and on the desk to put more used tea bags in, or to set a strainer in. Over-steeped tea is not nice. I might want to re-use the bag later. And I know if I don\'t do this I will just put the teabag on the table itself and it will stain and get gross. This way when I do my tidying up at night before going to bed if the bowl is full I can take it all to the compost bag in the kitchen at once.</p>\n<p>When I had the hot water boiler I kept an off-brand Brita filter pitcher next to the fridge on the counter out of the way and would keep it full of water so that when the dispenser ran out of water I could just reach over and grab the pitcher and refill it, and then refill the pitcher. I teach every new roommate this process to try to extend the life of the machine.</p>\n<p>Prior to my current roommate and the way we have had to re-arrange the kitchen to accommodate <em>him</em> (he\'s short, most of the shelves are too high for him to reach) I also kept a box of the teabags that I use most often next to the water boiler. So I just need to have a mug, grab a teabag, add water, go back to what I\'m doing. There isn\'t really room to do that now so I have to go into a cupboard in the kitchen to get my tea and honestly just that extra step is annoying. I might move it somewhere else.</p>\n<p>I have plenty of nice loose teas in sealed containers and I keep a spoon in the cupboard with them for scooping it, along with the strainers and some powdered ginger. The mugs are on the shelf above the tea. The teas I use the most are closer to the front of the shelf and the other ones are in the back where it\'s harder to reach. I pretty much only drink varieties of Chinese green tea: jasmine, oolong, white tea, green tea. Sometimes a black tea or pu\'er or Earl Grey if I need the caffeine kick. Plus a ginger and turmeric mixed tisane that may or may not actually be good at settling the stomach but feels nice and isn\'t caffeinated.</p>\n<p>The tea I go through the most, though, is an imported brand called <a href="https://www.foodbasics.ca/aisles/beverages/tea-hot-drinks/green-tea/china-green-tea-bags/p/6945307400228">Hao Tea (Food Basics link)</a> that is sold in various Canadian chain supermarkets, often in the "international" section. This is the best price to value green tea you can easily get in Canada outside of import markets, the only competition is from the <a href="https://www.tntsupermarket.com/">T&amp;T supermarket house brand</a>, which sells <a href="https://www.tntsupermarket.com/eng/74789101-tnt-organic-green-tea-tea-bag-100s.html">100 bag boxes</a> of also quite decent jasmine, green, and oolong tea for a couple bucks more. Now that T&amp;T has been bought by Loblaws you can find it in some of the Loblaws stores. And maybe <a href="https://itoen.com/">Ito En</a>, although I see them around less.</p>\n<p>The point is, it\'s about $4.50 for a box of 100 bags of Hao Tea and it will taste better than Tetley or President\'s Choice or Twinings. It won\'t taste <em>as</em> good as loose leaf, but we\'re sacrificing quality for price and convenience. When I don\'t want to make a decision about what tea to have, I can just grab from the box of cheap green tea. As a bonus, they are wrapped in paper wrappers rather than plastic or foil so you can recycle them.</p>\n<p>I don\'t settle for just having the boxes on the shelf though. The Hao Tea boxes are meant to be stacked horizontally and have a flap lid that is just annoying. My method is to put it on it\'s side, rip off the flaps on one of the shorter sides of the rectangle, and tap the top flap closed. Now I can just reach in and take the tea bags out and as the number of tea bags goes down I can rip more of the cardboard off the box. Voilà, life hack. If this was nicer tea I would say you should keep it in an airtight container, but it isn\'t special tea and I\'m going to go through it too fast to be noticing oxidization.</p>\n<p>I\'ll spare you my rant on not using boiling water on green or white teas. But with a kettle you don\'t really get a choice unless you stand there and turn the kettle off just before it hits a rolling boil. So I have to add a bit of cold water from the kitchen sink to the boiling water to bring it down to a better temperature. I then put the teabag in and wrap the string around the handle so it doesn\'t fall in.</p>\n<p>Then I can go back to doing whatever I was going to do, if I haven\'t forgotten in the process of making the tea or gotten distracted. Once it\'s steeped enough I take the teabag out and put it in the nearest dish. I will drink that tea almost to the bottom and then get up and get more hot water, if it\'s still hot enough, and repeat that a few times. If I have to turn the kettle back on to re-boil the water manually and then go sit down again to wait for it I will 90% of the time forget to get back up to get it. But if I stand in the kitchen waiting for it, I <em>will</em> lose track of what I was doing.</p>\n<p>I decided to keep track today of how much tea I actually drank so I filled the kettle to 1L exactly and haven\'t refilled it. After 3.5 hours I\'ve drank about 700 ml of tea. 200ml per hour. Which isn\'t too bad, I guess? I was expecting it to be worse, but that is also including time where I ran out of tea and turned on the kettle and then forgot about the kettle. My doctor worried I get too much caffeine from this tea habit, but now that I\'m officially on prescription stimulants I think it\'s apparent that they don\'t actually do much to me. I also would not characterize it as an addiction, because I can perfectly happily switch to drinking mostly water and cold tisanes and watered down iced tea all summer.</p>\n<p>So that, in a very extremely roundabout way, is my optimized tea-making process. And I will be watching my camelcamelcamel price tracker to see if <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01CEK4NHE/">a mid-range Panasonic hot water boiler (Amazon link)</a> goes on sale for Black Friday.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 1\xa0week ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-08-fantasy-life-i-130-hr-update" title="Fantasy Life i - 130 hr update">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-11-the-traitors-death-game-manga" title="The Traitors &amp; Death Game Manga">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'A recommendation of hot water dispensers, cheap green tea brands, and description of my tea-making process™.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-08-making-tea/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'A recommendation of hot water dispensers, cheap green tea brands, and description of my tea-making process™.'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'cooking', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'journal', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-08T22:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=22, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=281, tm_isdst=0)}

I also have 49 of 51 characters, so there must be one more story character to recruit.

It was the closest I\'ve been to actually dying in a fight in this game, but since I mostly play Magician I just stayed out of range and blasted him while occasionally healing the team until he was worn down. I thought that was the last Coliseum fight but apparently there\'s one more. I\'ve been fighting level 70 enemies in Ginormosia so it should be possible…?</p>\n<p>I suppose I should do the final story battle soon. I don\'t think it\'s a great idea story wise to have all this backstory only revealed in optional content at the very end of the game, but I suppose you don\'t really need to know why the Big Bad is the way he is. It\'s a simplistic story anyway.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 1\xa0week, 1\xa0day ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-07-bearblog-custom-colours" title="Bearblog Customization: Colours">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-08-making-tea" title="Making Tea">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Some Lives hit Hero rank, clearing the Dark Castle, ranking up more regions in Ginormosia, a Colliseum win, and other grinding.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-08-fantasy-life-i-130-hr-update/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Some Lives hit Hero rank, clearing the Dark Castle, ranking up more regions in Ginormosia, a Colliseum win, and other grinding.'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'fantasy life i', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'video games', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-08T17:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=17, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=281, tm_isdst=0)}

Due back at the library on Friday, but it\'s short.</p>\n<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><h3 id="the-traitors-uk-s03">The Traitors UK S03</h3><p>A mildly interesting wink murder / werewolf game premise. Beautiful landscape shots and interior sets on the Scottish Highlands, high production value. Claudia Winkleman being either very serious and dramatic or cracking up, both very entertaining. I wish they had put a bit more into the central conceit, like who are the traitors and why are these people here? They go through a lot of effort to put some spooky theatricality into it, but there\'s no cohesive lore. Also disappointed by the elementary school level simplicity of the missions they have to go on, which aside from some being physically demanding, seemed almost impossible to fail.</p>\n<p>Unlike most American (and Canadian) game shows, this one does not focus on the desperation of the players for the cash prize and their tragic backstories. Most people\'s motives for getting the money aren\'t revealed until midway through, and even then it\'s things like "we want to do IVF" or "I got married during covid so I want to go on a honeymoon" instead of the typical American game show contestant\'s "I\'m a single mom who works 60hrs/week minimum wage and my son has brain cancer and unless I get this money he will die and my home will be foreclosed on". Since the cash prize is split by the winners (unless there\'s only one Traitor who takes it all) there is incentive to winnow down the number of your fellow faithful towards the end of the game, but there wasn\'t a lot of that kind of strategizing shown. A lot of we\'re all best friends it\'s sad we can\'t trust each other, let\'s all work together. And honestly it\'s kind of nice to have lower stakes and less being bludgeoned in the face with the tragedy of the capitalist system for your stupid reality TV show.</p>\n<p>There is a celebrity version coming out starting Oct 8th that I am looking forward to because the celebrities <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Celebrity_Traitors">are quite stacked with interesting characters</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on watching this I am tempted to make a reclist of death game manga that are significantly more challenging and bloodthirsty.</p>\n<h3 id="taskmaster-s20">Taskmaster S20</h3><p>I have come back around on Taskmaster S20 with Episode 3, just so many things happened. The prizes were incredible, and I so much prefer when the prize is an actual weird-ass thing (like an IUD) and not an excuse to do a Cats Does Countdown style bit. "Find out the woman in the room\'s name" will absolutely go down as a classic task as good as any in the early series.</p>\n<h3 id="sportsball">Sportsball</h3><p>Keeping an eye on the baseball as the Blue Jays actually kind of have a chance to go to the World Series?

This happens sometimes mostly from hunching at the computer and being too tense. I have to be careful about not re-triggering it, I can feel it a bit now. I have a prescription for a muscle relaxant that is the only thing that has ever worked on making it stop, but they\'re sedating, I have to pay for them out of pocket, and you\'re not really supposed to take them long term so I have to ration them.</p>\n<p>I have been staying up really late lately, like 5am, and it\'s wearing me down.

I really feel like we need curated link lists again now, with the state of slop and SEO, but I don\'t want to expose my linkding instance to The Internet so here we are.</p>\n<p>Went back through some old Theme CSS posts and put the full theme css in the bottom of each of them, because you never know, someone might want to use my old shittier code? For historical reasons? ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>\n<h2 id="new-post-description-box">New post description box</h2><p>The main thing I wanted to work on but really barely touched was embedding post descriptions at the top of the template. I always write meta_descriptions and then nobody sees them.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;post-description&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{ post_description }}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n<p>I\'m not really happy with it yet, but it\'s there.

Up until now I had just been inserting special characters directly into the html/css but I went through and changed them all to proper unicode. There\'s something about being really fussy about fancy unicode icons that really makes me feel of the LJ days and doing all these elaborate post layouts in tables.</p>\n<h2 id="revisiting-the-toc">Revisiting the ToC</h2><p>As evidence of the fact that I have actually learned things, one of the first things I tried to do in CSS for the blog theme was to make the number markers on ordered lists bold. I tried a really awful method that stripped out the numbers and then put them back in... Today I realized I totally know how to make them bold and it\'s easy. Be amazed by my newfound selector prowess:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">ol</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nd">marker</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">600</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n<p><em>jazz hands</em></p>\n<p>I also added a down arrow that appears when you hover over the ToC links for funsies.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">toc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nd">hover</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nd">after</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">content</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">\'\\2193\'</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">vertical-align</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">top</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">--size-small</span><span class="p">);</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">600</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n<p>The spacing had also, once again, gone wonky with lists and needed a lot of massaging back into place.

He had been struggling for a month or two before that, but I had assumed it was arthritis. I didn\'t realize how bad it was until I had to take him to the emergency vet because it was clear he wasn\'t eating or drinking and just wanted to lay down and die. Even while I was at the emergency hospital it didn\'t really sink in until after I left and was walking home.</p>\n<p>I have had cats before, but they were never really "my" cats. After couchsurfing and generally being in precarious housing situations for a year and a half the number one thing I wanted to do after finding stable housing was to adopt a cat. I moved in to my current apartment in March 2020, just before the first covid lockdown started, and July 1st I picked up Levi at his foster parent\'s home. I never got to meet him in person before adopting him because of the social distancing. But I had seen his photo on the rescue website and immediately was like "omg that is a huge cat" and then when I read his profile I really felt like we were kindred spirits and I had to have him. He was the first and only cat I really considered.</p>\n<p>Levi had obviously been feral for at least a portion of his life because his ear was clipped and that is usually done as part of feral catch and release neuter and spay programs. But he was Huge. 10 kg / 22 lbs when I adopted him and he peaked at around 11 kg / 24 lbs. All we really know about him is that he was left at the rescue organization\'s office, outside, in a crate, probably over the weekend and the staff only found him when they showed up Monday morning. And it was very clear he was not at all socialized to humans. The rescue staff were actually both a bit relieved that I wanted him and were really careful to be sure I understood he wouldn\'t be a friendly, cuddly cat. I was totally ready for that.</p>\n<p>What I was not ready for was literally one week to the day after I adopted him he developed the symptoms of a urinary blockage and I had to take him to the emergency vet late at night. Again, this was still during covid lock-downs, so I had to stand outside and pace at like 3am while they phoned me periodically with updates. I could only barely fit the deposit fee on my credit card and had no idea how I was going to pay it off. At the time, I was on Ontario Works while I waited for my disability decision, which paid a grand total of $733 as my total monthly income. My half of rent and utilities in my 2BR1BA apartment was $950. I frantically tried to get in touch with the person who had co-ordinated my adoption and made the argument that if I had just not adopted him for another week this would have been the foster parent\'s issue and the rescue would have had to cover the cost of the surgery. She shunted me up the management chain to someone who signs cheques who finally agreed to help pay for the surgery and had him transferred to a vet they work with regularly who would give a discounted rate compared to the emergency vet for the surgery he needed to remove the blockage.</p>\n<p>My roommate at the time, A, was a friend of a friend from undergrad who barely knew me, and did not sign up for this but did help me take him from the emergency hospital to the second vet in a cab once he had been stabilized and helped me get through the appointment as I was exhausted. But Levi was still such a fighter. He had just almost died and he gave the vet techs absolute hell the whole time he was there. Because the level of crystals and irritation in his bladder was so bad the vet recommended doing a surgery to redirect his urethra to the back and basically remove the penis altogether. It is the narrowness of the penis that causes the crystals ("struvites") to become stuck and cause this problem, it\'s quite rare in female cats. So, yes, my cat had bottom surgery. After the surgery I saw his records and apparently he tore his IV out almost as soon as he came out of sedation, absolutely destroyed his cage, and was screaming and hollaring the whole time they tried to get him back into a crate for me to take him home. He was such a fighter and I loved that about him so much.</p>\n<p>So I had a huge credit card bill and pet insurance didn\'t pay me a cent. But I had my cat.</p>\n<p>I have scars on my arms from where he scratched me. He would draw blood at least once a day for the first couple years. It took a long time for him to learn that I didn\'t understand him and he had communication options other than biting and scratching. It was weeks before he even meowed. I taught him to use his voice, for better or worse, by singing stupid songs to him while I mixed his expensive prescription urinary wet cat food with PEG 3550 for constipation. He had clearly never learned to keep his claws in while playing, so it was hard to keep him entertained without taking a severe mauling. But he did like playing catch with rolled up balls of saran wrap and he would happily learn little tricks in exchange for treats. I got him to learn sit, stay, come, paw up, to touch a specific point on the floor, and he would chase thrown treats down the hallway. He got frustrated with more complicated games like hiding treats in egg cartons or doing "which hand is it in?". While he was obviously quite food motivated, and dinner was the most important part of his day, he was never a binge eater. He would eat until he was full and leave the rest. It\'s honestly a mystery how he got so fat. I eventually found he had a tapeworm, so for some of those years he was even eating for two!</p>\n<p>Sometimes Levi would have what I can only call PTSD episodes. I try not to anthropomorphize animals, but it was very much like he was seeing scary things that weren\'t there. His eyes would be kind of glassy and he would stare warily into the middle distance with his pupils blown up huge. He would want to be close to me, on the bed, but facing the door, and if I moved at all he would jump up and attack me and then run away. And normally he never ran away from anything, he would even hold his ground against the vacuum. These episodes eventually wore off, after a couple years.</p>\n<p>His food routine was what <em>my</em> entire daily routine revolved around. I was home practically all the time with him, so my day started with waking up and feeding him, he got fed multiple times throughout the day, and my video game time in the evening had to be planned around his wet food supper time or I\'d be interrupted mid-battle by a very insistent cat. He knew he was the most important thing in my life and he made sure he kept that priority status. We settled into a routine where I would get up and feed him and then make myself a bowl of cereal or yoghurt and sit down on the couch, then I would place a specific cushion on my lap and pat it. And he would jump up on it and allow me to pet him for a while until he got over-stimulated. The cushion was necessary because he was too big to fit onto my lap comfortably and he would dig his claws in really hard when he was kneading. Even though he wasn\'t a clingy type, he did often like to sit next to me or on my lap and I eventually learned the subtle ear signals that he didn\'t want to be pet any more.</p>\n<p>I tried a lot of cat "relaxation" aromas, but he hated the smell of them. He liked catnip a lot, but he was an angry drunk so I couldn\'t give it to him often. (People call catnip weed for cats, but it\'s actually more like alcohol in terms of lowering inhibitions). His favourite toy was a string of yarn, balls of saran wrap, the stuffed fish, and cardboard boxes. He liked Temptations cat treats, did not like greenies, and was extremely good at avoiding taking pills. He preferred bird meat to beef or fish. Despite all my best efforts to reduce his food intake he never really lost any weight, and honestly the only reason why I cared about it was because I didn\'t want him to develop diabetes.</p>\n<p>When my third roommate, D,  moved in here she brought with her a long sleek black male cat named Athos. We were uncertain if he and Levi would get along so kept Athos in my roommate\'s bedroom at first, but the first night they were here Levi and Athos were already trying to play with each other through the gap under the door. I have video of it. They were instantly best friends and would play as rough as they wanted with each other. Unfortunately, one night a few months later Athos died suddenly, with no warning. My roommate woke me up at like 4am sobbing saying she had gotten up to pee and found Athos laying on the floor dead. I had literally just stepped over him to go to the bathroom like an hour earlier and he had been fine, so it must have been a heart attack or something similar, because there was nothing obvious he could have eaten or choked on. Nothing had been gotten into. My roommate was distraught and it was impossible to explain to Levi that his friend wasn\'t coming back. Levi started walking up and down the hallway just meowing like he does when he\'s calling for me, but he didn\'t want me and didn\'t want anything else either.</p>\n<p>Some months later D decided she needed to have another cat in the house and intentionally adopted one that was completely the opposite of Athos: small, female, calico. Daisy was… a real handful. Levi definitely didn\'t like her at first and maybe was still mourning Athos. He would bully her a lot. Like if she jumped up onto the couch to sit, he would immediately get up there and bite her until she moved out of that spot and then he would sit there. He would never let her sit next to him at all, although he did let her eat his food. He never really tried to hurt her, and he could have if he wanted to. I guess she wasn\'t hugely bothered by it because she would always keep coming back trying to be friendly with him, but he would never really play with her the way he would with Athos.</p>\n<p>Daisy was absolutely obsessed with licking people and other cats, whether you wanted her to or not, and needed attention all of the time. It might have been something about her having been a very young feral mother who lost her litter. She was sweet, but very loud and very demanding. She was even more insistent on keeping to routine than Levi, sometimes it seemed like he actually sent her into the bedroom to wake me up so I would go feed them. Being home all the time meant I did most of the work of raising Daisy and I cared about her, she had the loudest purr in the smallest cat I\'ve ever met, but I absolutely did not really miss taking care of her when D moved out, she was <em>so</em> much work. I think Levi missed her a little bit, but not like he did Athos.</p>\n<p>One of the things about me and Levi is that we always lived in this apartment together. He trusted me and he knew that this place was absolutely his territory first and other people would come and go, but he would stay. He hated furniture being moved around and people coming in and out during move days, but he warmed up to most of my roommates, enough to butt his head against their legs sometimes or sit next to them on the couch at least.</p>\n<p>My previous roommate before my current one, R, had a former feral dog Gherkin which he kept crated in his room or on a leash all of the time because he had gone through every kind of training with this dog and he was still hyper-anxious unless he felt securely restrained. Off-leash Gherkin would whine and bark and get defensive, at worst he would lash out, but on (short) leash he would happily bound up to me for pets and was perfectly happy. So he and Levi mostly just stared at each other when they met in the hallway and otherwise didn\'t interact.</p>\n<p>R was the one who went with me to the emergency vet when I got the call that the tests had come back positive for cancer and Levi wasn\'t stable enough to come home so I would have to go and do the euthanasia that same night. The emergency vet clinic staff was absolutely, incredibly considerate through the whole thing and talked me through all the options for cremation without trying to pressure sell me anything, so I appreciate them for that. They gave me as much time as I wanted with him in a room and I cried and he was so zonked out on painkillers and hooked up to oxygen, he looked awful. I felt so bad that he had gotten so sick and I hadn\'t even realized. He was so strong and seeing him so quiet like he had lost all his ability to fight was really awful.</p>\n<p>In the end, nobody knows how old he was. The rescue had estimated 10-12 when I adopted him and I had him for four years. I really thought I would have more time before I would have to say goodbye. He had been my reward for sticking through the homelessness, and he had been my only source of unconditional love through some really shitty isolated times. When a therapist later asked me to imagine a safe place I said I couldn\'t, because Levi had been my safe place. Whenever things were bad he was there to keep me grounded and even though he wasn\'t the most affectionate or cuddly his trust was unwavering. I always said it was just him and me, nobody else mattered. So with him gone I really felt like everything was over. What was I even fighting so hard for if he wasn\'t going to be there?</p>\n<p>September and October of last year were really, really awful. In a lifetime of stressful, deeply depressive episodes, this is very much up there with the worst of them. In addition to the grief of Levi dying I still had about $4000 on a credit card from the vet and other extra expenses that I didn\'t know how I was going to pay off. I still have about $2000 of that sitting on a 0% APR credit card that will start collecting interest in November.</p>\n<p>Within a couple weeks of Levi dying R was suddenly moving out because he couldn\'t stand the stress and noise from my dysfunctional downstairs neighbours any more. After four years of trying to be accommodating and do literally anything else I could to solve the problem I took the nuclear step of sending a formal complaint to the landlord about the neighbours. I hate landlords and this landlord in particular so it was really the very last resort. Unfortunately, the incompetent landlord massively fucked up the complaint by not following proper procedure to have them evicted, so I\'m still dealing with that noise pretty much daily as well. Finding a new roommate is super stressful and requires a lot of spending time crafting posts for Facebook groups and Kijiji and then waiting for people to respond and then trying to determine if they are moderately trustworthy. It\'s like dating but a lot higher stakes. I ended up paying the full rent on the apartment for an extra month just so I could find someone who wouldn\'t cause problems.</p>\n<p>I made up my mind to get out of this apartment, I hate having a roommate and I hate my neighbours and I hate my landlord, it was never going to get better. But I still haven\'t found a job so I can actually afford to live somewhere else. I had to find a new roommate to replace R and I did, that is my current roommate N, and he didn\'t come with any animals. After finding a new roommate I thought I would find a job, find a new place, and then adopt a new cat. But one year later that life plan has only gotten past the first hurdle and at this point I don\'t know when that will change.</p>\n<p>I still don\'t think I\'m ready to get Levi\'s old stuff out of the corner I have it packed away in.</p>\n<p>I think I spent most of October last year crying or cleaning, that\'s what it felt like anyway. I honestly think I cried more than I have ever cried about anything in my entire life. I cried so much I got psoriasis on my eyelids from rubbing them with tissues. One of the things I did after Levi died was print a bunch of photos of him at one of those grocery store Kodiak kiosks and frame them and put them up around the house. So I still see him every day. I kept a little handwritten diary for a while every time I thought of him I would write it down. And I still have his ashes in a small wooden box from the cremation company with a clay pawprint. I don\'t cry absolutely every time I think of him any more, but I still feel like I lost a big part of my life and there\'s a big hole where he used to be. I had really hoped I could have moved on, in a practical sense, by now and it bothers me a lot that I\'m still here in this fucking apartment on the one year anniversary of his death. I really, really miss my big baby boy. I know he would be annoyed by me crying though, he always hated it.</p>\n<p>If you have a pet that you love give them a little smooch on the head from me today. If they hate being smooched all the better.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 1\xa0week, 5\xa0days ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-03-fantasy-life-i-110hrs" title="Fantasy Life i - 110 hr update">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-04-bearblog-theme-css-v9" title="Bearblog Theme CSS v9">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Some memories of my cat Levi, who passed away this day last year.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-04-levi/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Some memories of my cat Levi, who passed away this day last year.'}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'journal', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-04T13:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=4, tm_hour=13, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=5, tm_yday=277, tm_isdst=0)}

This makes sense, as a proper compiler library will channel the efforts of contributors into building developer tools, which in turn, will increase the adoption rate of the language. However, progress on this topic has been slow, mainly due to two aspects: (1) the lack of a clear direction, and (2) the intimidating complexity of the DMD frontend, which requires significant work on the compiler codebase.</p>\n<p>The good news is that we now have a plan, which I will outline in this blog post. The bad news is that implementing this plan requires significant effort, and we need more contributors. However, the silver lining is that the work, while extensive, mostly involves refactoring the code. This provides an excellent opportunity for contributors to familiarize themselves with the compiler codebase while delivering real value. Before delving into the specifics, let me give you some background.</p>\n<h2 id="currentstatusandhowwegothere">Current Status And How We Got Here</h2>\n<p>To fully understand the work done so far on the compiler-as-a-library project, I highly recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/eKT3MYpRgYA?si=FwY84BMXYGLtpGgQ">my talk</a> on this subject.</p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Several years ago, we began packaging the compiler as a library.</li>\n<li>Our goal was to clearly separate compilation phases: lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, optimizations, and code generation.</li>\n<li>The parsing and semantic analysis modules were interdependent, necessitating a method for separation.</li>\n<li>We opted to template the parser with an ASTFamily template parameter, defining the AST nodes required for parsing.</li>\n<li>We created ASTBase (containing AST nodes essential for parsing) and ASTCodegen (containing AST nodes needed for code generation).</li>\n<li>ASTBase, as it stands, is code duplicated from ASTCodegen.</li>\n<li>We started extracting semantic routines and fields from AST nodes to eliminate ASTBase&#8217;s code duplication by importing a subset of modules used by ASTCodegen.</li>\n<li>Additionally, we began replacing third-party libraries (like <a href="https://github.com/dlang-community/libdparse/tree/master/src">libdparse</a>) with the DMD-as-a-library package.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more detailed information on each of these points, I recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/eKT3MYpRgYA?si=FwY84BMXYGLtpGgQ">the talk</a> I referenced.</p>\n<p>Recently, I proposed to Walter a modification to the codebase that would significantly enhance the flexibility of the compiler library, allowing any AST node to be overwritten. Walter was hesitant to accept my proposal, concerned about the potential &#8220;ugliness&#8221; it would introduce to the codebase. He cited the addition of ASTBase and the resulting code duplication as a precedent. He then suggested that if we eliminate ASTBase, he would reconsider my proposal.</p>\n<h2 id="whatyoucandotohelp">What You Can Do To Help</h2>\n<p>We are now focused on eliminating the duplication in ASTBase. To achieve this, we need to extract all information related to semantic analysis from the existing AST nodes. The challenge is the sheer number of AST nodes and the multitude of functions associated with each. I have been working on this sporadically over the past few months, and progress is slow due to the nature of the work: it mostly involves moving code, creating visitors, breaking dependencies, etc. While not overly complex, it isn&#8217;t particularly creative work either. However, for someone interested in understanding a real-life compiler codebase, it&#8217;s an ideal starting point.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re willing to support this initiative, I&#8217;ve put together <a href="https://github.com/dlang/dmd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#refactoring-the-dmd-ast">a guide on where to start and what you can do</a>. Feel free to contact me on Slack (razvan.nitu), Discord, or email (razvan.nitu1305@gmail.com) for more details or to request a review of your PR.</p>\n<p>I see this as an excellent opportunity to onboard new people into compiler development in a way that benefits both the language and the contributor. So, if you have some spare time, please join us in getting this work done!</p>'}]}

This article illustrates many simple methods of making your code self-evident and much easier to understand and maintain</p>\n<p>To let you know what you’re fightin’ for, allow me to introduce this little gem I wrote back in 1987:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#define O1O printf\n#define OlO putchar\n#define O10 exit\n#define Ol0 strlen\n#define QLQ fopen\n#define OlQ fgetc\n#define O1Q abs\n#define QO0 for\ntypedef char lOL;\n\nlOL*QI[] = {&quot;Use:\\012\\011dump file\\012&quot;,&quot;Unable to open file \'\\x25s\'\\012&quot;,\n  &quot;\\012&quot;,&quot;   &quot;,&quot;&quot;};\n\nmain(I,Il)\nlOL*Il[];\n{       FILE *L;\n         unsigned lO;\n         int Q,OL[\' \'^\'0\'],llO = EOF,\n\n         O=1,l=0,lll=O+O+O+l,OQ=056;\n         lOL*llL=&quot;%2x &quot;;\n         (I != 1&lt;&lt;1&amp;&amp;(O1O(QI[0]),O10(1011-1010))),\n         ((L = QLQ(Il[O],&quot;r&quot;))==0&amp;&amp;(O1O(QI[O],Il[O]),O10(O)));\n         lO = I-(O&lt;&lt;l&lt;&lt;O);\n         while (L-l,1)\n         {       QO0(Q = 0L;((Q &amp;~(0x10-O))== l);\n                         OL[Q++] = OlQ(L));\n                 if (OL[0]==llO) break;\n                 O1O(&quot;\\0454x: &quot;,lO);\n                 if (I == (1&lt;&lt;1))\n                 {       QO0(Q=Ol0(QI[O&lt;&lt;O&lt;&lt;1]);Q&lt;Ol0(QI[0]);\n                         Q++)O1O((OL[Q]!=llO)?llL:QI[lll],OL[Q]);/*&quot;\n                         O10(QI[1O])*/\n                         O1O(QI[lll]);{}\n                 }\n                 QO0 (Q=0L;Q&lt;1&lt;&lt;1&lt;&lt;1&lt;&lt;1&lt;&lt;1;Q+=Q&lt;0100)\n                 {       (OL[Q]!=llO)? /* 0010 10lOQ 000LQL */\n                         ((D(OL[Q])==0&amp;&amp;(*(OL+O1Q(Q-l))=OQ)),\n                         OlO(OL[Q])):\n                         OlO(1&lt;&lt;(1&lt;&lt;1&lt;&lt;1)&lt;&lt;1);\n                 }\n                 O1O(QI[01^10^9]);\n                 lO+=Q+0+l;}\n         }\n         D(l) { return l&gt;=\' \'&amp;&amp;l&lt;=\'\\~\';\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Yes, this is how we wrote C code back then. I even <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/winners.html">won an award</a> for it!</p>\n<p>Although I am a very slow learner, I do learn over time, and gradually the code got better. You’re probably having the same issues with your code. (Or the code written by coworkers, as I agree that <em>your</em> code certainly does not need improvement!)</p>\n<p>This article is about techniques that will help make code self-evident. You are probably already doing some of them. I bet there are some you aren&#8217;t. I also am sure you’re going to argue with me about some of them. Trust me, you’re wrong! If you don’t agree with me now, you will if you’re still programming five years hence.</p>\n<p>I know you’re busy, so let’s jump right in with an observation:</p>\n<p>“Anybody can write complicated code. It takes genius to write simple code.”</p>\n<p>or, if you prefer:</p>\n<p>“The highest accolade your code can garner is: oh pshaw, anybody could have<br />\nwritten that!”</p>\n<p>For example, since I started as an aerospace engineer:</p>\n<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3146" height="1600" src="https://dlang.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lever.jpg" width="1066" /></p>\n<p>consider this lever commonly found in aircraft cockpits. No fair if you already know what it does. Examine it casually. What is it for?</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>It raises and lowers the landing gear. What’s the clue? It’s got a little tire for a knob! Pull the lever up, and the gear gets sucked up. Push it down, the gear goes down. Is that self-evident or what? It’s a masterpiece of simplicity. It doesn’t even need any labels. If the cockpit is filled with smoke, or you&#8217;re focused on what&#8217;s outside the window, your hand knows immediately it’s on the gear lever&mdash;not the flaps or the throttles or the copilot’s ejection seat (just kidding). This kind of stupid simple control is what cockpit designers strive for because pulling the right lever is literally a life-and-death decision. I mean <em>literally</em> in the literal sense of the word.</p>\n<p>This is what we desperately want to achieve in programming. Stupid simple. We’ll probably fail, but the closer the better.</p>\n<p>Diving in&#8230;</p>\n<h3 id="justshootmenow">Just Shoot Me Now</h3>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">#define BEGIN {\n#define END   }</pre>\n<p>Believe it or not, this was common C practice back in the 1980s. It falls into the category of &#8220;Don’t try to make your new language look like your previous language&#8221;. This problem appears in multiple guises. I still tend to name variables in Fortran style from back when the oceans hadn’t yet formed. Before moving to D, I realized that using C macros to invent a personal custom language on top of C was an abomination. Removing it and replacing it with ordinary C code was a big improvement in clarity.</p>\n<h3 id="don’treinventbool">Don’t Reinvent bool</h3>\n<p>Learn what bool is and use it as intended. Accept that the following are all the same:</p>\n<table cols="2" rows="5">\n<tr>\n<td>false</td>\n<td>true</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>off</td>\n<td>on</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0 volts</td>\n<td>5 volts</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>And that this makes code unequivocally worse:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">enum { No, Yes };</pre>\n<p>Just use <code>false</code> and <code>true</code>. Done. And BTW,</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">enum { Yes, No };</pre>\n<p>is just an automatic &#8220;no hire&#8221; decision, as <code>if (Yes)</code> will thoroughly confuse everyone. If you&#8217;ve done this, run and fix it before someone curses your entire ancestry.</p>\n<h3 id="horrorsblockedbyd">Horrors Blocked by D</h3>\n<p>D&#8217;s syntax has been designed to prevent some types of coding horrors.</p>\n<h4 id="cregexexpressionswithoperatoroverloading">C++ Regex expressions with operator overloading</h4>\n<p>I’m not even going to link to this. It can be found with diligent searching. What it does is use operator overloading to make ordinary-looking C++ code actually be a regex! It violates the principle that code should not pretend to be in another language. Imagine the inept error messages the compiler will bless you with if there&#8217;s a coding mistake with this. D makes this hard to do by only allowing arithmetic operators to be overloaded, which disallows things like an overloaded unary <code>*</code>.</p>\n<p>(It’s harder, but still possible, to abuse operator overloading in D. But fortunately, making it harder has largely discouraged it.)</p>\n<h4 id="metaprogrammingwithmacros">Metaprogramming with macros</h4>\n<p>Many people have requested macros be added to D. We&#8217;ve resisted this because macros inevitably result in people inventing their own custom, undocumented language layered over D. This makes it impractical for anyone else to make use of this code. In my not-so-humble opinion, macros are the reason why Lisp has never caught on in the mainstream. No Lisper can read anyone else&#8217;s Lisp code.</p>\n<h4 id="cargumentdependentlookup">C++ Argument Dependent Lookup</h4>\n<p>Nobody knows what symbol will actually be found. ADL was added so one could do operator overloading on the left operand. D just has a simple syntax for left or right operand overloading.</p>\n<h4 id="sfinae">SFINAE</h4>\n<p>Nobody knows if SFINAE is in play or not for any particular expression.</p>\n<h4 id="floorwaxortastydesserttopping">Floor Wax or Tasty Dessert Topping</h4>\n<p>This refers to the confusion between a struct being a value type or a reference type or some chimera of both. In D, a struct is a value type and a class is a reference type. To be fair, some people still try to build a D chimera type, but they should be cashiered.</p>\n<h4 id="multipleinheritance">Multiple inheritance</h4>\n<p>Nobody has ever made a convincing case for why this is needed. Things get really nasty when diamond inheritance is used. Pity the next guy and avoid the temptation. D has multiple inheritance for interfaces only, which has proved to be more than adequate.</p>\n<h3 id="codeflow">Code Flow</h3>\n<p>Code should flow from left to right, and top to bottom. Just like how this article is read.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">f() + g() // which executes first?</pre>\n<p>Fortunately, D guarantees a left-to-right ordering (C does not). But what about:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">g(f(e(d(c(b(a))),3)));</pre>\n<p>That executes inside out! Quick, which function call does the <code>3</code> get passed to? D’s Universal Function Call Syntax to the rescue:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">a.b.c.d(3).e.f.g;</pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s the equivalent, but execution flows clearly left-to-right. Is this an extreme example, or the norm?</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import std.stdio;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.algorithm;\n\nvoid main() {\n     stdin.byLine(KeepTerminator.yes).\n     map!(a =&gt; a.idup).\n     array.\n     sort.\n     copy(stdout.lockingTextWriter());\n}</pre>\n<p>This code reads from <code>stdin</code> by lines, puts the lines in an array, sorts the array, and writes the sorted result to <code>stdout</code>. It doesn’t quite meet our &#8220;stupid simple&#8221; criteria, but it is pretty close. All with a nice flow from left to right and top to bottom.</p>\n<p>The example also nicely segues into the next observation.</p>\n<h3 id="themorecontrolpathsthelessunderstandable">The More Control Paths, the Less Understandable</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shaw: You know a great deal about computers, don’t you?<br />\nMr. Spock: I know all about them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I submit that:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">version (X)\n     doX();\ndoY();\nif (Z)\n     doZ();</pre>\n<p>is less comprehensible than:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">doX();\ndoY();\ndoZ();</pre>\n<p>What happened to the conditional expressions? Move them to the interiors of <code>doX()</code> and <code>doZ()</code>.</p>\n<p>I know what you’re thinking. &#8220;But Walter, you didn’t eliminate the conditional expressions, you just moved them!&#8221; Quite right, but those conditional expressions properly belong in the functions, rather than enclosing those functions. They are part of the conceptual encapsulation a function provides, so the caller is clean.</p>\n<h3 id="negation">Negation</h3>\n<p>Negation in English:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dr McCoy: We’re trying to help you, Oxmyx.<br />\nBela Oxmyx: Nobody helps nobody but himself.<br />\nMr. Spock: Sir, you are employing a double negative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cowardly Lion: Not nobody! Not nohow!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Negation in English is often used as emphasis, rather than logical negation. Our perception of negation is fuzzy and fraught with error. This is something propagandists use to smear someone.</p>\n<p>What the propagandist says: &#8220;Bob is not a drunkard!&#8221;</p>\n<p>What the audience hears: &#8220;Bob is a drunkard!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Skilled communicators avoid negation. Savvy programmers do, too. How many times have you overlooked a not operator? I have many times.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (!noWay)</pre>\n<p>is inevitably perceived as:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (noWay)</pre>\n<p>I mentioned this discovery to my good friend Andrei Alexandrescu. He didn’t buy it. He said I needed research to back it up. I didn’t have any research, but didn’t change my mind (i.e., hubris). Eventually, I did run across a paper that did do such research and came to the same conclusion as my assumption. I excitedly sent it to Andrei, and to his great credit, he conceded defeat, which is why Andrei is an exceptional man (rare is the person who ever concedes defeat!).</p>\n<p>The lesson here is to avoid using negation in identifiers if at all possible.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (way)</pre>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t that better?</p>\n<h4 id="dmdsourcecodehallofshame">DMD Source Code Hall of Shame</h4>\n<p>My own code is hardly a paragon of virtue. Some identifiers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>tf.isnothrow</code></li>\n<li><code>IsTypeNoreturn</code></li>\n<li><code>Noaccesscheck</code></li>\n<li><code>Ignoresymbolvisibility</code></li>\n<li><code>Include.notComputed</code></li>\n<li><code>not nothrow</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have no excuse and shall have myself flagellated with a damp cauliflower. Did I say I didn’t like the code I wrote five years ago?</p>\n<p>This leads us to the D <code>version</code> conditional.</p>\n<h3 id="negationandversion">Negation and <code>version</code></h3>\n<p><a href="https://dlang.org/spec/version.html#version-specification">D version conditionals</a> are very simple:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">version ( Identifier )</pre>\n<p><em>Identifier</em> is usually predefined by the compiler or the command line. Only an identifier is allowed&mdash;no negation, AND, OR, or XOR. (Collectively call that <em>version algebra</em>.) Our users often chafe at this restriction, and I get that it&#8217;s difficult to accept the rationale at first. It’s not impossible to do version algebra:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">version (A) { } else {\n    // !A\n}\n\nversion (A) version (B) {\n    // A &amp;&amp; B\n}\n\nversion (A) version = AorB;\nversion (B) version = AorB;\nversion (AorB) {\n     // A || B\n}</pre>\n<p>and so forth. But it’s clumsy and unattractive <em>on purpose</em>. Why would D do such a thing? It’s meant to encourage thinking about versions in a positive manner. Suppose a project has a Windows and an OSX build:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">version (Windows) {\n     ...\n}\nelse version (OSX) {\n     ...\n}\nelse\n     static assert(0, &quot;unsupported operating system&quot;);</pre>\n<p>Isn’t that better than this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">...\nversion (!Windows){\n...\n}</pre>\n<p>I’ve seen an awful lot of that style in C. It makes it pointlessly difficult to add support for a new operating system. After all, what the heck is the &#8220;not Windows&#8221; operating system? That really narrows things down! The former snippet makes it so much easier.</p>\n<p>Taking this a step further:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C &amp;&amp; D)\n\nif (A || B || C || D)</pre>\n<p>are easy for a human to parse. Encountering:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">\nif (A &amp;&amp; (!B || C))</pre>\n<p>is always like transitioning from smooth asphalt to a cobblestone road. Ugh. I&#8217;ve made mistakes with such constructions all the time. Not only is it hard to even see the <code>!</code>, but it’s still hard to satisfy yourself that it is correct.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, De Morgan’s Theorem can sometimes come to the rescue:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">(!A &amp;&amp; !B) =&gt; !(A || B)\n(!A || !B) =&gt; !(A &amp;&amp; B)</pre>\n<p>It gets rid of one negation. Repeated application can often transform it into a much more easily understood equation while being equally correct.</p>\n<p>Anecdote: When designing digital logic circuits, the NAND gate is more efficient than the AND gate because it has one less transistor. (AND means (A &amp;&amp; B), NAND means !(A &amp;&amp; B)). But humans just stink at crafting bug-free NAND logic. When I worked on the design of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Boolean_Expression_Language">ABEL programming language</a> back in the 1980s, which was for programming Programmable Logic Devices, ABEL would accept input in positive logic. It would use De Morgan’s theorem to automatically convert it to efficient negative logic. The electronics designers loved it.</p>\n<p>To sum up this section, here’s a shameful snippet from Ubuntu’s unistd.h:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">#if defined __USE_BSD || (defined __USE_XOPEN &amp;&amp; !defined __USE_UNIX98)</pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prof Marvel: I can’t bring it back, I don’t know how it works!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id="castsarebugs">Casts Are Bugs</h3>\n<p>Casts subvert the protections of the typing system. Sometimes you just gotta have them (to implement <code>malloc</code>, for example, the result needs a cast), but far too often they are simply there to correct sloppy misuse of types. Hence, in D casts are done with the keyword <code>cast</code>, not a peculiar syntax, making them easily greppable. It&#8217;s worthwhile to occasionally grep a code base for <code>cast</code> and see if the types can be reworked to eliminate the need for the cast and have the type system working for rather than against you.</p>\n<p>Pull Request: <a href="https://github.com/dlang/dmd/pull/15488">remove some dyncast calls</a></p>\n<h3 id="self-documentingfunctiondeclarations">Self-Documenting Function Declarations</h3>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">char* xyzzy(char* p)</pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Does <code>p</code> modify what it points to?</li>\n<li>Is <code>p</code> returned?</li>\n<li>Does <code>xyzzy</code> free <code>p</code>?</li>\n<li>Does <code>xyzzy</code> save <code>p</code> somewhere, like in a global?</li>\n<li>Does <code>xyzzy</code> throw <code>p</code>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These crucial bits of information are rarely noted in the documentation for the function. Even worse, the documentation often gets it wrong! What is needed is self-documenting code that is enforced by the compiler. D has attributes to cover this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">const char* xyzzy(return scope const char* p)</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>p</code> doesn’t modify what it points to</li>\n<li><code>p</code> is returned</li>\n<li><code>p</code> is not free’d</li>\n<li><code>xyzzy</code> does not squirrel away a copy of <code>p</code></li>\n<li><code>p</code> is not thrown in an exception</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is all documentation that now isn&#8217;t necessary to write, and the compiler will check its accuracy for you. Yes, it is called &#8220;attribute soup&#8221; for good reason, and takes some getting used to, but it&#8217;s still better than bad documentation, and adding attributes is optional.</p>\n<h3 id="functionargumentsandreturns">Function Arguments and Returns</h3>\n<p>Function inputs and outputs present in the function declaration are the &#8220;front door&#8221;. Any inputs and outputs that are not in the function declaration are &#8220;side doors&#8221;. Side doors include things like global variables, environment variables, getting information from the operating system, reading/writing files, throwing exceptions, etc. Side doors are rarely accounted for in the documentation. The poor sap calling a function has to carefully read its implementation to discern what the side doors are.</p>\n<p>Self-evident code should strive to run everything through the front door. Not only does this help with comprehension, but it also enables delightful things like easy unit testing.</p>\n<h3 id="memoryallocation">Memory Allocation</h3>\n<p>An ongoing problem faced by functions that implement an algorithm that needs to allocate memory is what memory allocation scheme should be used. Often a reusable function imposes the memory allocation method on the caller. That&#8217;s backward.</p>\n<p>For memory that is allocated and free&#8217;d by the function, the solution is that the function decides how to do it. For allocated objects that are returned by the function, the caller should decide the allocation scheme by passing an argument that specifies it. This argument often takes the form of a &#8220;sink&#8221; to send the output to. More on that later.</p>\n<h3 id="passabstract“sink”foroutput">Pass Abstract “sink” for Output</h3>\n<p>The auld way (extracted from the DMD source code):</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import dmd.errors;\nvoid gendocfile(Module m) {\n     ...\n     if (!success)\n         error(&quot;expansion limit&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<p><code>error()</code> is a function that error messages are sent to. This is a typical formulation seen in conventional code. The error message is going out through the side door. The caller of <code>gendocfile()</code> has no say in what&#8217;s done with the error message, and the fact that it even generates error messages is usually omitted by the documentation. Worse, the error message emission makes it impractical to properly unit test the function.</p>\n<p>A better way is to pass an abstract interface &#8220;sink&#8221; as a parameter and send the error messages to the sink:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import dmd.errorsink;\nvoid gendocfile(Module m, ErrorSink eSink) {\n     ...\n     if (!success)\n         eSink.error(&quot;expansion limit&quot;);\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Now the caller has total control of what happens to the error messages, and it is implicitly documented. A unit tester can provide a special implementation of the interface to suit testing convenience.</p>\n<p>Here’s a real-world PR making this improvement:</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/dlang/dmd/pull/15471">doc.d: use errorSink</a></p>\n<h3 id="passfilesasbuffersratherthanfilestoread">Pass Files as Buffers Rather than Files to Read</h3>\n<p>Typical code I&#8217;ve written, where the file names are passed to a function to read and process them:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void gendocfile(Module m, const(char)*[] docfiles) {\n     OutBuffer mbuf;\n     foreach (file; ddocfiles) {\n         auto buffer = readFile(file.toDString());\n         mbuf.write(buffer.data);\n     }\n     ...\n}</pre>\n<p>This kind of code is a nuisance to unit test, as adding file I/O to the unit tester is very clumsy, and, as a result, no unit tests get written.

This kept the first two posts simpler in that they did not have to deal with function attribute inference, which I have referred to as &#8220;attribute auto inference&#8221; in earlier posts. However, both <code>auto</code> functions and templates are very common in D code, so a series on DIP1000 can&#8217;t be complete without explaining how those features work with the language changes. Function attribute inference is our most important tool in avoiding so-called &#8220;attribute soup&#8221;, where a function is decorated with several attributes, which arguably decreases readability.</p>\n<p>We will also dig deeper into unsafe code. The previous two posts in this series focused on the <code>scope</code> attribute, but this post is more focused on attributes and memory safety in general. Since DIP1000 is ultimately about memory safety, we can&#8217;t get around discussing those topics.</p>\n<h2 id="avoidingrepetitionwithattributes">Avoiding repetition with attributes</h2>\n<p><a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#function-attribute-inference">Function attribute inference</a> means that the language will analyze the body of a function and will automatically add the <code>@safe</code>, <code>pure</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, and <code>@nogc</code> attributes where applicable. It will also attempt to add <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> attributes to parameters and <code>return ref</code> to <code>ref</code> parameters that can&#8217;t otherwise be compiled. Some attributes are never inferred. For instance, the compiler will not insert any <code>ref</code>, <code>lazy</code>, <code>out</code> or <code>@trusted</code> attributes, because very likely they are explicitly not wanted where they are left out.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to turn on function attribute inference. One is by omitting the return type in the function signature. Note that the <code>auto</code> keyword is not required for this. <code>auto</code> is a placeholder keyword used when no return type, storage class, or attribute is specified. For example, the declaration <code>half(int x) { return x/2; }</code> does not parse, so we use <code>auto half(int x) { return x/2; }</code> instead. But we could just as well write <code>@safe half(int x) { return x/2; }</code> and the rest of the attributes (<code>pure</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, and <code>@nogc</code>) will be inferred just as they are with the <code>auto</code> keyword.</p>\n<p>The second way to enable attribute inference is to templatize the function. With our <code>half</code> example, it can be done this way:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">int divide(int denominator)(int x) { return x/denominator; }\nalias half = divide!2;</pre>\n<p>The D spec does not say that a template must have any parameters. An empty parameter list can be used to turn attribute inference on: <code>int half()(int x) { return x/2; }</code>. Calling this function doesn&#8217;t even require the template instantiation syntax at the call site, e.g., <code>half!()(12)</code> is not required as <code>half(12)</code> will compile.</p>\n<p>Another means to turn on attribute inference is to store the function inside another function. <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#nested">These are called nested functions</a>. Inference is enabled not only on functions nested directly inside another function but also on most things nested in a type or a template inside the function. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void parentFun()\n{\n    // This is auto-inferred.\n    int half(int x){ return x/2; }\n\n    class NestedType\n    {\n        // This is auto inferred\n        final int half1(int x) { return x/2; }\n\n        // This is not auto inferred; it\'s a\n        // virtual function and the compiler\n        // can\'t know if it has an unsafe override\n        // in a derived class.\n        int half2(int x) { return x/2; }\n    }\n\n    int a = half(12); // Works. Inferred as @safe.\n    auto cl = new NestedType;\n    int b = cl.half1(18); // Works. Inferred as @safe.\n    int c = cl.half2(26); // Error.\n}</pre>\n<p>A downside of nested functions is that they can only be used in lexical order (the call site must be below the function declaration) unless both the nested function and the call are inside the same struct, class, union, or template that is in turn inside the parent function. Another downside is that they don&#8217;t work with <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#pseudo-member">Uniform Function Call Syntax</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, attribute inference is always enabled for <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/expression.html#FunctionLiteral">function literals</a> (a.k.a. lambda functions). The halving function would be defined as <code>enum half = (int x) =&gt; x/2;</code> and called exactly as normal. However, the language does not consider this declaration a function. It considers it a function pointer. This means that in global scope it&#8217;s important to use <code>enum</code> or <code>immutable</code> instead of <code>auto</code>. Otherwise, the lambda can be changed to something else from anywhere in the program and cannot be accessed from <code>pure</code> functions. In rare cases, such mutability can be desirable, but most often it is an antipattern (like global variables in general).</p>\n<h3 id="limitsofinference">Limits of inference</h3>\n<p>Aiming for minimal manual typing isn&#8217;t always wise. Neither is aiming for maximal attribute bloat.</p>\n<p>The primary problem of auto inference is that subtle changes in the code can lead to inferred attributes turning on and off in an uncontrolled manner. To see when it matters, we need to have an idea of what will be inferred and what will not.</p>\n<p>The compiler in general will go to great lengths to infer <code>@safe</code>, <code>pure</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, and <code>@nogc</code> attributes. If your function <em>can</em> have those, it almost always will. The specification says that recursion is an exception: a function calling itself should not be <code>@safe</code>, <code>pure</code>, or <code>nothrow</code> unless explicitly specified as such. But in my testing, I found those attributes actually are inferred for recursive functions. It turns out, there is an ongoing effort to get recursive attribute inference working, and it partially works already.</p>\n<p>Inference of <code>scope</code> and <code>return</code> on function parameters is less reliable. In the most mundane cases, it&#8217;ll work, but the compiler gives up pretty quickly. The smarter the inference engine is, the more time it takes to compile, so the current design decision is to infer those attributes in only the simplest of cases.</p>\n<h3 id="wheretoletthecompilerinfer">Where to let the compiler infer?</h3>\n<p>A D programmer should get into the habit of asking, &#8220;What will happen if I mistakenly do something that makes this function unsafe, impure, throwing, garbage-collecting, or escaping?&#8221; If the answer is &#8220;immediate compiler error&#8221;, auto inference is probably fine. On the other hand, the answer could be &#8220;user code will break when updating this library I&#8217;m maintaining&#8221;. In that case, annotate manually.</p>\n<p>In addition to the potential of losing attributes the author intends to apply, there is also another risk:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe pure nothrow @nogc firstNewline(string from)\n{\n    foreach(i; 0 .. from.length) switch(from[i])\n    {\n        case \'\\r\':\n        if(from.length &gt; i+1 &amp;&amp; from[i+1] == \'\\n\')\n        {\n            return &quot;\\r\\n&quot;;\n        }\n        else return &quot;\\r&quot;;\n\n        case \'\\n\': return &quot;\\n&quot;;\n\n        default: break;\n    }\n\n    return &quot;&quot;;\n}\n</pre>\n<p>You might think that since the author is manually specifying the attributes, there&#8217;s no problem. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s wrong. Suppose the author decides to rewrite the function such that all the return values are slices of the <code>from</code> parameter rather than string literals:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe pure nothrow @nogc firstNewline(string from)\n{\n    foreach(i; 0 .. from.length) switch(from[i])\n    {\n        case \'\\r\':\n        if (from.length &gt; i + 1 &amp;&amp; from[i + 1] == \'\\n\')\n        {\n            return from[i .. i + 2];\n        }\n        else return from[i .. i + 1];\n\n        case \'\\n\': return from[i .. i + 1];\n\n        default: break;\n    }\n\n    return &quot;&quot;;\n}</pre>\n<p>Surprise! The parameter <code>from</code> was previously inferred as <code>scope</code>, and a library user was relying on that, but now it&#8217;s inferred as <code>return scope</code> instead, breaking client code.</p>\n<p>Still, for internal functions, auto inference is a great way to save both our fingers when writing and our eyes when reading. Note that it&#8217;s perfectly fine to rely on auto inference of the <code>@safe</code> attribute as long as the function is used in explicitly in <code>@safe</code> functions or unit tests. If something potentially unsafe is done inside the auto-inferred function, it gets inferred as <code>@system</code>, not <code>@trusted</code>. Calling a <code>@system</code> function from a <code>@safe</code> function results in a compiler error, meaning auto inference is safe to rely on in this case.</p>\n<p>It still sometimes makes sense to manually apply attributes to internal functions, because the error messages generated when they are violated tend to be better with manual attributes.</p>\n<h3 id="whatabouttemplates">What about templates?</h3>\n<p>Auto inference is always enabled for templated functions. What if a library interface needs to expose one? There is a way to block the inference, albeit an ugly one:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">private template FunContainer(T)\n{\n    // Not auto inferred\n    // (only eponymous template functions are)\n    @safe T fun(T arg){return arg + 3;}\n}\n\n// Auto inferred per se, but since the function it calls\n// is not, only @safe is inferred.\nauto addThree(T)(T arg){return FunContainer!T.fun(arg);}</pre>\n<p>However, which attributes a template should have often depends on its compile-time parameters. It would be possible to use metaprogramming to designate attributes depending on the template parameters, but that would be a lot of work, hard to read, and easily as error-prone as relying on auto inference.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s more practical to just test that the function template infers the wanted attributes. Such testing doesn&#8217;t have to, and probably shouldn&#8217;t, be done manually each time the function is changed. Instead:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">float multiplyResults(alias fun)(float[] arr)\n    if (is(typeof(fun(new float)) : float))\n{\n    float result = 1.0f;\n    foreach (ref e; arr) result *= fun(&amp;e);\n    return result;\n}\n\n@safe pure nothrow unittest\n{\n    float fun(float* x){return *x+1;}\n    // Using a static array makes sure\n    // arr argument is inferred as scope or\n    // return scope\n    float[5] elements = [1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f];\n\n    // No need to actually do anything with\n    // the result. The idea is that since this\n    // compiles, multiplyResults is proven @safe\n    // pure nothrow, and its argument is scope or\n    // return scope.\n    multiplyResults!fun(elements);\n}</pre>\n<p>Thanks to D&#8217;s compile-time introspection powers, testing against unwanted attributes is also covered:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe unittest\n{\n    import std.traits : attr = FunctionAttribute,\n        functionAttributes, isSafe;\n\n    float fun(float* x)\n    {\n        // Makes the function both throwing\n        // and garbage collector dependant.\n        if (*x &gt; 5) throw new Exception(&quot;&quot;);\n        static float* impureVar;\n\n        // Makes the function impure.\n        auto result = impureVar? *impureVar: 5;\n\n        // Makes the argument unscoped.\n        impureVar = x;\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    enum attrs = functionAttributes!(multiplyResults!fun);\n\n    assert(!(attrs &amp; attr.nothrow_));\n    assert(!(attrs &amp; attr.nogc));\n\n    // Checks against accepting scope arguments.\n    // Note that this check does not work with\n    // @system functions.\n    assert(!isSafe!(\n    {\n        float[5] stackFloats;\n        multiplyResults!fun(stackFloats[]);\n    }));\n\n    // It\'s a good idea to do positive tests with\n    // similar methods to make sure the tests above\n    // would fail if the tested function had the\n    // wrong attributes.\n    assert(attrs &amp; attr.safe);\n    assert(isSafe!(\n    {\n        float[] heapFloats;\n        multiplyResults!fun(heapFloats[]);\n    }));\n}</pre>\n<p>If assertion failures are wanted at compile time before the unit tests are run, adding the <code>static</code> keyword before each of those <code>assert</code>s will get the job done. Those compiler errors can even be had in non-unittest builds by converting that unit test to a regular function, e.g., by replacing <code>@safe unittest</code> with, say, <code>private @safe testAttrs()</code>.</p>\n<h2 id="thelivefireexercise:system">The live fire exercise: @system</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that D is a systems programming language. As this series has shown, in most D code the programmer is well protected from memory errors, but D would not be D if it didn&#8217;t allow going low-level and bypassing the type system in the same manner as C or C++: bit arithmetic on pointers, writing and reading directly to hardware ports, executing a <code>struct</code> destructor on a raw byte blob&#8230; D is designed to do all of that.</p>\n<p>The difference is that in C and C++ it takes only one mistake to break the type system and <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213">cause undefined behavior</a> anywhere in the code. A D programmer is only at risk when not in a <code>@safe</code> function, or when using dangerous compiler switches such as <code>-release</code> or <code>-check=assert=off</code> (failing a disabled assertion is undefined behavior), and even then the semantics tend to be less UB-prone. For example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">float cube(float arg)\n{\n    float result;\n    result *= arg;\n    result *= arg;\n    return result;\n}</pre>\n<p>This is a language-agnostic function that compiles in C, C++, and D. Someone intended to calculate the cube of <code>arg</code> but forgot to initialize <code>result</code> with <code>arg</code>. In D, nothing dangerous happens despite this being a <code>@system</code> function. No initialization value means <code>result</code> is default initialized to <code>NaN</code> (not-a-number), which leads to the result also being <code>NaN</code>, which is a glaringly obvious &#8220;error&#8221; value when using this function the first time.</p>\n<p>However, in C and C++, not initializing a local variable means reading it is (sans a few narrow exceptions) <em>undefined behavior</em>. This function does not even handle pointers, yet according to the standard, calling this function could just as well have <code>*(int*) rand() = 0XDEADBEEF;</code> in it, all due to a trivial mistake. While many compilers with enabled warnings will catch this one, not all do, and these languages are full of similar examples where even warnings don&#8217;t help.</p>\n<p>In D, even if you explicitly requested no default initialization with <code>float result = void</code>, it&#8217;d just mean the return value of the function is undefined, not anything and everything that happens if the function is called. Consequently, that function could be annotated <code>@safe</code> even with such an initializer.</p>\n<p>Still, for anyone who cares about memory safety, as they probably should for anything intended for a wide audience, it&#8217;s a bad idea to assume that D <code>@system</code> code is safe enough to be the default mode. Two examples will demonstrate what can happen.</p>\n<h3 id="whatundefinedbehaviorcando">What undefined behavior can do</h3>\n<p>Some people assume that &#8220;Undefined Behavior&#8221; simply means &#8220;erroneous behavior&#8221; or crashing at runtime. While that is often what ultimately happens, undefined behavior is far more dangerous than, say, an uncaught exception or an infinite loop. The difference is that with undefined behavior, you have no guarantees at all about what happens. This might not sound any worse than an infinite loop, but an accidental infinite loop is discovered the first time it&#8217;s entered. Code with undefined behavior, on the other hand, might do what was intended when it&#8217;s tested, but then do something completely different in production. Even if the code is tested with the same flags it&#8217;s compiled with in production, the behavior may change from one compiler version to another, or when making completely unrelated changes to the code. Time for an example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// return whether the exception itself is in the array\nbool replaceExceptions(Object[] arr, ref Exception e)\n{\n    bool result;\n    foreach (ref o; arr)\n    {\n        if (&amp;o is &amp;e) result = true;\n        if (cast(Exception) o) o = e;\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}</pre>\n<p>The idea here is that the function replaces all exceptions in the array with <code>e</code>. If <code>e</code> itself is in the array, it returns <code>true</code>, otherwise <code>false</code>. And indeed, testing confirms it works. The function is used like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto arr = [new Exception(&quot;a&quot;), null, null, new Exception(&quot;c&quot;)];\nauto result = replaceExceptions\n(\n    cast(Object[]) arr,\n    arr[3]\n);</pre>\n<p>This cast is not a problem, right? Object references are always of the same size regardless of their type, and we&#8217;re casting the exceptions to the parent type, <code>Object</code>. It&#8217;s not like the array contains anything other than object references.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not how <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/expression.html#AssignExpression">the D specification views it</a>. Having two class references (or any references, for that matter) in the same memory location but with different types, and then assigning one of them to the other, is undefined behavior. That&#8217;s exactly what happens in</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">if (cast(Exception) o) o = e;</pre>\n<p>if the array does contain the <code>e</code> argument. Since <code>true</code> can only be returned when undefined behavior is triggered, it means that any compiler would be free to optimize <code>replaceExceptions</code> to always return <code>false</code>. This is a dormant bug no amount of testing will find, but that might, years later, completely mess up the application when compiled with the powerful optimizations of an advanced compiler.</p>\n<p>It may seem that requiring a cast to use a function is an obvious warning sign that a good D programmer would not ignore. I wouldn&#8217;t be so sure. Casts aren&#8217;t that rare even in fine high-level code. Even if you disagree, other cases are provably bad enough to bite anyone. Last summer, this case <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/thread/t7qd45$1lrb$1@digitalmars.com">appeared in the D forums</a>:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">string foo(in string s)\n{\n    return s;\n}\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    import std.stdio;\n    string[] result;\n    foreach(c; &quot;hello&quot;)\n    {\n        result ~= foo([c]);\n    }\n    writeln(result);\n}</pre>\n<p>This problem was encountered by Steven Schveighoffer, a long-time D veteran who has himself <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/2016/09/28/how-to-write-trusted-code-in-d/">lectured about <code>@safe</code> and <code>@system</code></a> on <a href="https://dconf.org/2020/online/#steven">more than one occasion</a>. Anything that can burn him can burn any of us.</p>\n<p>Normally, this works just as one would think and is fine according to the spec. However, if one enables <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#in-params">another soon-to-be-default language feature</a> with the <code>-preview=in</code> compiler switch along with DIP1000, the program starts malfunctioning. The old semantics for <code>in</code> are the same as <code>const</code>, but the new semantics make it <code>const scope</code>.</p>\n<p>Since the argument of <code>foo</code> is <code>scope</code>, the compiler assumes that <code>foo</code> will copy <code>[c]</code> before returning it, or return something else, and therefore it allocates <code>[c]</code> on the same stack position for each of the &#8220;hello&#8221; letters. The result is that the program prints <code>[&quot;o&quot;, &quot;o, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;o&quot;]</code>. At least for me, it&#8217;s already somewhat hard to understand what&#8217;s happening in this simple example. Hunting down this sort of bug in a complex codebase could be a nightmare.</p>\n<p>(With my nightly DMD version somewhere between 2.100 and 2.101 a compile-time error is printed instead. With 2.100.2, the example runs as described above.)</p>\n<p>The fundamental problem in both of these examples is the same: <code>@safe</code> is not used. Had it been, both of these undefined behaviors would have resulted in compilation errors (the <code>replaceExceptions</code> function itself can be <code>@safe</code>, but the cast at the usage site cannot). By now it should be clear that <code>@system</code> code should be used sparingly.</p>\n<h3 id="whentoproceedanyway">When to proceed anyway</h3>\n<p>Sooner or later, though, the time comes when the guard rail has to be temporarily lowered. Here&#8217;s an example of a good use case:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">/// Undefined behavior: Passing a non-null pointer\n/// to a standalone character other than \'\\0\', or\n/// to an array without \'\\0\' at or after the\n/// pointed character, as utf8Stringz\nextern(C) @system pure\nbool phobosValidateUTF8(const char* utf8Stringz)\n{\n    import std.string, std.utf;\n\n    try utf8Stringz.fromStringz.validate();\n    catch (UTFException) return false;\n\n    return true;\n}</pre>\n<p>This function lets code written in another language validate a UTF-8 string using Phobos. C being C, it tends to use zero-terminated strings, so the function accepts a pointer to one as the argument instead of a D array. This is why the function has to be unsafe. There is no way to safely check that <code>utf8Stringz</code> is pointing to either <code>null</code> or a valid C string. If the character being pointed to is not <code>\'\\0\'</code>, meaning the next character has to be read, the function has no way of knowing whether that character belongs to the memory allocated for the string. It can only trust that the calling code got it right.</p>\n<p>Still, this function is a good use of the <code>@system</code> attribute. First, it is presumably called primarily from C or C++. Those languages do not get any safety guarantees anyway. Even a <code>@safe</code> function is safe only if it gets only those parameters that can be created in <code>@safe</code> D code. Passing <code>cast(const char*) 0xFE0DA1</code> as an argument to a function is unsafe no matter what the attribute says, and nothing in C or C++ verifies what arguments are passed.</p>\n<p>Second, the function clearly documents the cases that would trigger undefined behavior. However, it does not mention that passing an invalid pointer, such as the aforementioned <code>cast(const char*) 0xFE0DA1</code>, is UB, because UB is always the default assumption with <code>@system</code>-only values unless it can be shown otherwise.</p>\n<p>Third, the function is small and easy to review manually. No function should be needlessly big, but it&#8217;s many times more important than usual to keep <code>@system</code> and <code>@trusted</code> functions small and simple to review. <code>@safe</code> functions can be debugged to pretty good shape by testing, but as we saw earlier, undefined behavior can be immune to testing. Analyzing the code is the only general answer to UB.</p>\n<p>There is a reason why the parameter does not have a <code>scope</code> attribute. It could have it, no pointers to the string are escaped. However, it would not provide many benefits. Any code calling the function has to be <code>@system</code>, <code>@trusted</code>, or in a foreign language, meaning they can pass a pointer to the stack in any case. <code>scope</code> could potentially improve the performance of D client code in exchange for the increased potential for undefined behavior if this function is erroneously refactored. Such a tradeoff is unwanted in general unless it can be shown that the attribute helps with a performance problem. On the other hand, the attribute would make it clearer for the reader that the string is not supposed to escape. It&#8217;s a difficult judgment call whether <code>scope</code> would be a wise addition here.</p>\n<h3 id="furtherimprovements">Further improvements</h3>\n<p>It should be documented why a <code>@system</code> function is <code>@system</code> when it&#8217;s not obvious. Often there is a safer alternative&mdash;our example function could have taken a D array or the CString struct from the previous post in this series. Why was an alternative not taken? In our case, we could write that the ABI would be different for either of those options, complicating matters on the C side, and the intended client (C code) is unsafe anyway.</p>\n<p><code>@trusted</code> functions are like <code>@system</code> functions, except they can be called from <code>@safe</code> functions, whereas <code>@system</code> functions cannot. When something is declared <code>@trusted</code>, it means the authors have verified that it&#8217;s just as safe to use as an actual <code>@safe</code> function with any arguments that can be created within safe code. They need to be just as carefully reviewed, if not more so, as <code>@system</code> functions.</p>\n<p>In these situations, it should be documented (for other developers, not users) how the function was deemed to be safe in all situations. Or, if the function is not fully safe to use and the attribute is just a temporary hack, it should have a big ugly warning about that.</p>\n<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3131" height="383" src="https://dlang.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/unsafe-safe.jpg" width="651" /></p>\n<p>Such greenwashing is of course highly discouraged, but if there&#8217;s a codebase full of <code>@system</code> code that&#8217;s just too difficult to make <code>@safe</code> otherwise, it&#8217;s better than giving up. Even as we often talk about the dangers of UB and memory corruption, in our actual work our attitudes tend to be much more carefree, meaning such codebases are unfortunately common.</p>\n<p>It might be tempting to define a small <code>@trusted</code> function inside a bigger <code>@safe</code> function to do something unsafe without disabling checks for the whole function:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">extern(C) @safe pure\nbool phobosValidateUTF8(const char* utf8Stringz)\n{\n    import std.string, std.utf;\n\n    try (() @trusted =&gt; utf8Stringz.fromStringz)()\n      .validate();\n    catch (UTFException) return false;\n\n    return true;\n}</pre>\n<p>Keep in mind though, that the parent function needs to be documented and reviewed like an overt <code>@trusted</code> function because the encapsulated <code>@trusted</code> function can let the parent function do anything. In addition, since the function is marked <code>@safe</code>, it isn&#8217;t obvious on a first look that it&#8217;s a function that needs special care. Thus, a visible warning comment is needed if you elect to use <code>@trusted</code> like this.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, don&#8217;t trust yourself! Just like any codebase of non-trivial size has bugs, more than a handful of <code>@system</code> functions will include latent UB at some point. The remaining hardening features of D, meaning asserts, contracts, invariants, and bounds checking should be used aggressively and kept enabled in production. This is recommended even if the program is fully <code>@safe</code>. In addition, a project with a considerable amount of unsafe code should use external tools like LLVM address sanitizer and Valgrind to at least some extent.</p>\n<p>Note that the idea in many of these hardening tools, both those in the language and those of the external tools, is to crash as soon as any fault is detected. It decreases the chance of any surprise from undefined behavior doing more serious damage.</p>\n<p>This requires that the program is designed to accept a crash at any moment. The program must never hold such amounts of unsaved data that there would be any hesitation in crashing it. If it controls anything important, it must be able to regain control after being restarted by a user or another process, or it must have another backup program. Any program that &#8220;can&#8217;t afford&#8221; to run potentially crashing checks is in no business to be trusted with systems programming either.</p>\n<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>That concludes this blog series on DIP1000. There are some topics related to DIP1000 we have left up to the readers to experiment with themselves, such as associative arrays.

But D can refer to the stack in other ways, too, and that&#8217;s the topic of this article.</p>\n<h2 id="object-orientedinstancesaretheeasiestcase">Object-oriented instances are the easiest case</h2>\n<p>In Part 1, I said that if you understand how DIP1000 works with pointers, then you understand how it works with classes. An example is worth more than mere words:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe Object ifNull(return scope Object a, return scope Object b)\n{\n    return a? a: b;\n}</pre>\n<p>The <code>return scope</code> in the above example works exactly as it does in the following:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int* ifNull(return scope int* a, return scope int* b)\n{\n    return a? a: b;\n}</pre>\n<p>The principle is: if the <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> storage class is applied to an object in a parameter list, the address of the object instance is protected just as if the parameter were a pointer to the instance. From the perspective of machine code, it <strong>is</strong> a pointer to the instance.</p>\n<p>From the point of view of regular functions, that&#8217;s all there is to it. What about member functions of a class or an interface? This is how it&#8217;s done:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">interface Talkative\n{\n    @safe const(char)[] saySomething() scope;\n}\n\nclass Duck : Talkative\n{\n    char[8] favoriteWord;\n    @safe const(char)[] saySomething() scope\n    {\n        import std.random : dice;\n\n        // This wouldn\'t work\n        // return favoriteWord[];\n\n        // This does\n        return favoriteWord[].dup;\n\n        // Also returning something totally\n        // different works. This\n        // returns the first entry 40% of the time,\n        // The second entry 40% of the time, and\n        // the third entry the rest of the time.\n        return\n        [\n            &quot;quack!&quot;,\n            &quot;Quack!!&quot;,\n            &quot;QUAAACK!!!&quot;\n        ][dice(2,2,1)];\n    }\n}</pre>\n<p><code>scope</code> positioned either before or after the member function name marks the <code>this</code> reference as <code>scope</code>, preventing it from leaking out of the function. Because the address of the instance is protected, nothing that refers directly to the address of the fields is allowed to escape either. That&#8217;s why <code>return favoriteWord[]</code> is disallowed; it&#8217;s a static array stored inside the class instance, so the returned slice would refer directly to it. <code>favoriteWord[].dup</code> on the other hand returns a copy of the data that isn&#8217;t located in the class instance, which is why it&#8217;s okay.</p>\n<p>Alternatively one could replace the <code>scope</code> attributes of both <code>Talkative.saySomething</code> and <code>Duck.saySomething</code> with <code>return scope</code>, allowing the return of <code>favoriteWord</code> without duplication.</p>\n<h3 id="dip1000andliskovsubstitutionprinciple">DIP1000 and Liskov Substitution Principle</h3>\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">The Liskov substitution principle</a> states, in simplified terms, that an inherited function can give the caller more guarantees than its parent function, but never fewer. DIP1000-related attributes fall in that category. The rule works like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> if a parameter (including the implicit <code>this</code> reference) in the parent functions has no DIP1000 attributes, the child function may designate it <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code></li>\n<li> if a parameter is designated <code>scope</code> in the parent, it must be designated <code>scope</code> in the child</li>\n<li> if a parameter is <code>return scope</code> in the parent, it must be either <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> in the child</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there is no attribute, the caller can not assume anything; the function might store the address of the argument somewhere. If <code>return scope</code> is present, the caller can assume the address of the argument is not stored other than in the return value. With <code>scope</code>, the guarantee is that the address is not stored anywhere, which is an even stronger guarantee. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">class C1\n{   double*[] incomeLog;\n    @safe double* imposeTax(double* pIncome)\n    {\n        incomeLog ~= pIncome;\n        return new double(*pIncome * .15);\n    }\n}\n\nclass C2 : C1\n{\n    // Okay from language perspective (but maybe not fair\n    // for the taxpayer)\n    override @safe double* imposeTax\n        (return scope double* pIncome)\n    {\n        return pIncome;\n    }\n}\n\nclass C3 : C2\n{\n    // Also okay.\n    override @safe double* imposeTax\n        (scope double* pIncome)\n    {\n        return new double(*pIncome * .18);\n    }\n}\n\nclass C4: C3\n{\n    // Not okay. The pIncome parameter of C3.imposeTax\n    // is scope, and this tries to relax the restriction.\n    override @safe double* imposeTax\n        (double* pIncome)\n    {\n        incomeLog ~= pIncome;\n        return new double(*pIncome * .16);\n    }\n}</pre>\n<h2 id="thespecialpointerref">The special pointer, <code>ref</code></h2>\n<p>We still have not uncovered how to use <code>struct</code>s and <code>union</code>s with DIP1000. Well, obviously we&#8217;ve uncovered pointers and arrays. When referring to a <code>struct</code> or a <code>union</code>, they work the same as they do when referring to any other type. But pointers and arrays are not the canonical way to use structs in D. They are most often passed around by value, or by reference when <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#ref-params">bound to <code>ref</code> parameters</a>. Now is a good time to explain how <code>ref</code> works with DIP1000.</p>\n<p>They don&#8217;t work like just any pointer. Once you understand <code>ref</code>, you can use DIP1000 in many ways you otherwise could not.</p>\n<h3 id="asimplerefintparameter">A simple <code>ref int</code> parameter</h3>\n<p>The simplest possible way to use <code>ref</code> is probably this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void fun(ref int arg) {\n    arg = 5;\n}</pre>\n<p>What does this mean? <code>ref</code> is internally a pointer&mdash;think <code>int* pArg</code>&mdash;but is used like a value in the source code. <code>arg = 5</code> works internally like <code>*pArg = 5</code>. Also, the client calls the function as if the argument were passed by value:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto anArray = [1,2];\nfun(anArray[1]); // or, via UFCS: anArray[1].fun;\n// anArray is now [1, 5]</pre>\n<p>instead of <code>fun(&amp;anArray[1])</code>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(C%2B%2B)">Unlike C++ references</a>, D <code>ref</code>erences can be <code>null</code>, but the application will instantly terminate with a segmentation fault if a null <code>ref</code> is used for something other than reading the address with the <code>&amp;</code> operator. So this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">int* ptr = null;\nfun(*ptr);</pre>\n<p>&#8230;compiles, but crashes at runtime because the assignment inside <code>fun</code> lands at the null address.</p>\n<p>The address of a <code>ref</code> variable is always guarded against escape. In this sense <code>@safe void fun(ref int arg){arg = 5;}</code> is like <code>@safe void fun(scope int* pArg){*pArg = 5;}</code>. For example, <code>@safe int* fun(ref int arg){return &amp;arg;}</code> will not compile, just like <code>@safe int* fun(scope int* pArg){return pArg;}</code> will not.</p>\n<p>There is a <code>return ref</code> storage class, however, that allows returning the address of the parameter but no other form of escape, just like <code>return scope</code>. This means that <code>@safe int* fun(return ref int arg){return &amp;arg;}</code> works.</p>\n<h3 id="referencetoareference"><code>ref</code>erence to a reference</h3>\n<p><code>ref</code>erence to an <code>int</code> or similar type already allows much nicer syntax than one can get with pointers. But the real power of <code>ref</code> shows when it refers to a type that is a reference itself&mdash;a pointer or a class, for instance. <code>scope</code> or <code>return scope</code> can be applied to a reference that is referenced to by <code>ref</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe float[] mergeSort(ref return scope float[] arr)\n{\n    import std.algorithm: merge;\n    import std.array : Appender;\n\n    if(arr.length &lt; 2) return arr;\n\n    auto firstHalf = arr[0 .. $/2];\n    auto secondHalf = arr[$/2 .. $];\n\n    Appender!(float[]) output;\n    output.reserve(arr.length);\n\n    foreach\n    (\n        el;\n        firstHalf.mergeSort\n        .merge!floatLess(secondHalf.mergeSort)\n    )   output ~= el;\n\n    arr = output[];\n    return arr;\n}\n\n@safe bool floatLess(float a, float b)\n{\n    import std.math: isNaN;\n\n    return a.isNaN? false:\n          b.isNaN? true:\n          a&lt;b;\n}</pre>\n<p><code>mergeSort</code> here guarantees it won&#8217;t leak the address of the <code>float</code>s in <code>arr</code> except in the return value. This is the same guarantee that would be had from a <code>return scope float[] arr</code> parameter. But at the same time, because <code>arr</code> is a <code>ref</code> parameter, <code>mergeSort</code> can mutate the array passed to it. Then the client can write:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">float[] values = [5, 1.5, 0, 19, 1.5, 1];\nvalues.mergeSort;</pre>\n<p>With a non-<code>ref</code> argument, the client would have to write <code>values = values.sort</code> instead (not using <code>ref</code> would be a perfectly reasonable API in this case, because we do not always want to mutate the original array). This is something that cannot be accomplished with pointers, because <code>return scope float[]* arr</code> would protect the address of the array&#8217;s metadata (the <code>length</code> and <code>ptr</code> fields of the array), not the address of it&#8217;s contents.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to have a returnable <code>ref</code> argument to a <code>scope</code> reference. Since this example has a unit test, remember to use the <code>-unittest</code> compile flag to include it in the compiled binary.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe ref Exception nullify(return ref scope Exception obj)\n{\n    obj = null;\n    return obj;\n}\n\n@safe unittest\n{\n    scope obj = new Exception(&quot;Error!&quot;);\n    assert(obj.msg == &quot;Error!&quot;);\n    obj.nullify;\n    assert(obj is null);\n    // Since nullify returns by ref, we can assign\n    // to it\'s return value.\n    obj.nullify = new Exception(&quot;Fail!&quot;);\n    assert(obj.msg == &quot;Fail!&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<p>Here we return the address of the argument passed to <code>nullify</code>, but still guard both the address of the object pointer and the address of the class instance against being leaked by other channels.</p>\n<p><code>return</code> is a free keyword that does not mandate <code>ref</code> or <code>scope</code> to follow it. What does <code>void* fun(ref scope return int*)</code> mean then? <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#ref-return-scope-parameters">The spec states</a> that <code>return</code> without a trailing <code>scope</code> is always treated as <code>ref return</code>. This example thus is equivalent to <code>void* fun(return ref scope int*)</code>. However, this only applies if there is <code>ref</code>erence to bind to. Writing <code>void* fun(scope return int*)</code> means <code>void* fun(return scope int*)</code>. It&#8217;s even possible to write <code>void* fun(return int*)</code> with the latter meaning, but I leave it up to you to decide whether this qualifies as conciseness or obfuscation.</p>\n<h2 id="memberfunctionsandref">Member functions and <code>ref</code></h2>\n<p><code>ref</code> and <code>return ref</code> often require careful consideration to keep track of which address is protected and what can be returned. It takes some experience to get confortable with them. But once you do, understanding how <code>struct</code>s and <code>union</code>s work with DIP1000 is pretty straightforward.</p>\n<p>The major difference to classes is that where the <code>this</code> reference is just a regular class reference in class member functions, <code>this</code> in a struct or union member function is <code>ref StructOrUnionName</code>.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">union Uni\n{\n    int asInt;\n    char[4] asCharArr;\n\n    // Return value contains a reference to\n    // this union, won\'t escape references\n    // to it via any other channel\n    @safe char[] latterHalf() return\n    {\n        return asCharArr[2 .. $];\n    }\n\n    // This argument is implicitly ref, so the\n    // following means the return value does\n    // not refer to this union, and also that\n    // we don\'t leak it in any other way.\n    @safe char[] latterHalfCopy()\n    {\n        return latterHalf.dup;\n    }\n}</pre>\n<p>Note that <code>return ref</code> should not be used with the <code>this</code> argument. <code>char[] latterHalf() return ref</code> fails to parse. The language already has to understand what <code>ref char[] latterHalf() return</code> means: the return value is a <code>ref</code>erence. The &#8220;ref&#8221; in <code>return ref</code> would be redundant anyway.</p>\n<p>Note that we did not use the <code>scope</code> keyword here. <code>scope</code> would be meaningless with this union, because it does not contain references to anything. Just like it is meaningless to have a <code>scope ref int</code>, or a <code>scope int</code> function argument. <code>scope</code> makes sense only for types that refer to memory elsewhere.</p>\n<p><code>scope</code> in a <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> means the same thing as it means in a static array. It means that the memory its members refer to cannot be escaped. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct CString\n{\n    // We need to put the pointer in an anonymous\n    // union with a dummy member, otherwise @safe user\n    // code could assign ptr to point to a character\n    // not in a C string.\n    union\n    {\n        // Empty string literals get optimised to null pointers by D\n        // compiler, we have to do this for the .init value to really point to\n        // a \'\\0\'.\n        immutable(char)* ptr = &amp;nullChar;\n        size_t dummy;\n    }\n\n    // In constructors, the &quot;return value&quot; is the\n    // constructed data object.

This example demonstrates why. Imagine how easy it&#8217;d be to use a regular assert or forget about them totally, or overlook the need to use the anonymous union. I <em>think</em> this struct is safe to use, but it&#8217;s entirely possible I overlooked something.</p>\n<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>\n<p>We almost know all there is to know about using structs, unions, and classes with DIP1000. We have two final things to learn today.</p>\n<p>But before that, a short digression regarding the <code>scope</code> keyword. It is not used for just annotating parameters and local variables as illustrated. It is also used for <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/class.html#auto">scope classes</a> and <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/statement.html#scope-guard-statement">scope guard statements</a>. This guide won&#8217;t be discussing those, because the former feature is deprecated, and the latter is not related to DIP1000 or control of variable lifetimes. The point of mentioning them is to dispel a potential misconception that <code>scope</code> always means limiting the lifetime of something. Learning about scope guard statements is still a good idea, as it&#8217;s a useful feature.</p>\n<p>Back to the topic. The first thing is not really specific to structs or classes. We discussed what <code>return</code>, <code>return ref</code>, and <code>return scope</code> usually mean, but there&#8217;s an alternative meaning to them. Consider:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void getFirstSpace\n(\n    ref scope string result,\n    return scope string where\n)\n{\n    //...\n}</pre>\n<p>The usual meaning of the <code>return</code> attribute makes no sense here, as the function has a <code>void</code> return type. A special rule applies in this case: if the return type is <code>void</code>, and the first argument is <code>ref</code> or <code>out</code>, any subsequent <code>return</code> [<code>ref</code>/<code>scope</code>] is assumed to be escaped by assigning to the first argument. With struct member functions, they are assumed to be assigned to the struct itself.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe unittest\n{\n    static string output;\n    immutable(char)[8] input = &quot;on stack&quot;;\n    //Trying to assign stack contents to a static\n    //variable. Won\'t compile.\n    getFirstSpace(output, input);\n}</pre>\n<p>Since <code>out</code> came up, it should be said it would be a better choice for <code>result</code> here than <code>ref</code>. <code>out</code> works like <code>ref</code>, with the one difference that the referenced data is automatically default-initialized at the beginning of the function, meaning any data to which the <code>out</code> parameter refers is guaranteed to not affect the function.</p>\n<p>The second thing to learn is that <code>scope</code> is used by the compiler to optimize class allocations inside function bodies. If a <code>new</code> class is used to initialize a <code>scope</code> variable, the compiler can put it on the stack. Example:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">class C{int a, b, c;}\n@safe @nogc unittest\n{\n    // Since this unittest is @nogc, this wouldn\'t\n    // compile without the scope optimization.\n    scope C c = new C();\n}</pre>\n<p>This feature requires using the <code>scope</code> keyword explicitly. Inference of <code>scope</code> does not work, because initializing a class this way does not normally (meaning, without the <code>@nogc</code> attribute) mandate limiting the lifetime of <code>c</code>. The feature currently works only with classes, but there is no reason it couldn&#8217;t work with <code>new</code>ed struct pointers and array literals too.</p>\n<h3 id="untilnexttime">Until next time</h3>\n<p>This is pretty much all that there is to manual DIP1000 usage. But this blog series shall not be over yet! DIP1000 is not intended to always be used explicitly&mdash;it works with attribute inference. That&#8217;s what the next post will cover.</p>\n<p>It will also cover some considerations when daring to use <code>@trusted</code> and <code>@system</code> code. The need for dangerous systems programming exists and is part of the D language domain. But even systems programming is a responsible affair when people do what they can to minimize risks. We will see that even there it&#8217;s possible to do a lot.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Walter Bright and Dennis Korpel for reviewing this article</em></p>'}]}

Modern high-level languages like D are memory safe, preventing users from accidently reading or writing to unused memory or breaking the type system of the language.</p>\n<p>As a systems programming language, not all of D can give such guarantees, but it does have a memory-safe subset that uses the garbage collector to take care of memory management much like Java, C#, or Go. A D codebase, even in a systems programming project, should aim to remain within that memory-safe subset where practical. D provides the <code>@safe</code> function attribute to verify that a function uses only memory-safe features of the language. For instance, try this.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe string getBeginning(immutable(char)* cString)\n{\n    return cString[0..3];\n}</pre>\n<p>The compiler will refuse to compile this code. There&#8217;s no way to know what will result from the three-character slice of <code>cString</code>, which could be referring to an empty string (i.e., <code>cString[0]</code> is <code>\\0</code>), a string with a length of <code>1</code>, or even one or two characters without the terminating NUL. The result in those cases would be a memory violation.</p>\n<h3 id="safedoesnotmeanslow"><code>@safe</code> does not mean slow</h3>\n<p>Note that I said above that even a low-level systems programming project should use <code>@safe</code> where practical. How is that possible, given that such projects sometimes cannot use the garbage collector, a major tool used in D to guarantee memory safety?</p>\n<p>Indeed, such projects must resort to memory-unsafe constructs every now and then. Even higher-level projects often have reasons to do so, as they want to create interfaces to C or C++ libraries, or avoid the garbage collector when indicated by runtime performance. But still, surprisingly large parts of code can be made <code>@safe</code> without using the garbage collector at all.</p>\n<p>D can do this because the memory safe subset does not prevent raw memory access per se.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void add(int* a, int* b, int* sum)\n{\n    *sum = *a + *b;\n}</pre>\n<p>This compiles and is fully memory safe, despite dereferencing those pointers in the same completely unchecked way they are dereferenced in C. This is memory safe because <code>@safe</code> D does not allow creating an <code>int*</code> that points to unallocated memory areas, or to a <code>float**</code>, for instance. <code>int*</code> can point to the null address, but this is generally not a memory safety problem because the null address is protected by the operating system. Any attempt to dereference it would crash the program before any memory corruption can happen. The garbage collector isn&#8217;t involved, because D&#8217;s GC can only run if more memory is requestend from it, or if the collection is explicitly called.</p>\n<p>D slices are similar. When indexed at runtime, they will check at runtime that the index is less than their length and that&#8217;s it. They will do no checking whatsoever on whether they are referring to a legal memory area. Memory safety is achieved by preventing creation of slices that could refer to illegal memory in the first place, as demonstrated in the first example of this article. And again, there&#8217;s no GC involved.</p>\n<p>This enables many patterns that are memory-safe, efficient, and independent of the garbage collector.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Struct\n{\n    int[] slice;\n    int* pointer;\n    int[10] staticArray;\n}\n\n@safe @nogc Struct examples(Struct arg)\n{\n    arg.slice[5] = *arg.pointer;\n    arg.staticArray[0..5] = arg.slice[5..10];\n    arg.pointer = &amp;arg.slice[8];\n    return arg;\n}</pre>\n<p>As demonstrated, D liberally lets one do unchecked memory handling in <code>@safe</code> code. The memory referred to by <code>arg.slice</code> and <code>arg.pointer</code> may be on the garbage collected heap, or it may be in the static program memory. There is no reason the language needs to care. The program will probably need to either call the garbage collector or do some unsafe memory management to allocate memory for the pointer and the slice, but handling already allocated memory does not need to do either. If this function needed the garbage collector, it would fail to compile because of the <code>@nogc</code> attribute.</p>\n<h3 id="however...">However&#8230;</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s a historical design flaw here in that the memory may also be on the stack. Consider what happens if we change our function a bit.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe @nogc Struct examples(Struct arg)\n{\n    arg.pointer = &amp;arg.staticArray[8];\n    arg.slice = arg.staticArray[0..8];\n    return arg;\n}</pre>\n<p><code>Struct arg</code> is a value type. Its contents are copied to the stack when <code>examples</code> is called and can be ovewritten after the function returns. <code>staticArray</code> is also a value type. It&#8217;s copied along with the rest of the struct just as if there were ten integers in the struct instead. When we return <code>arg</code>, the contents of <code>staticArray</code> are copied to the return value, but <code>ptr</code> and <code>slice</code> continue to point to <code>arg</code>, not the returned copy!</p>\n<p>But we have a fix. It allows one to write code just as performant in <code>@safe</code> functions as before, including references to the stack. It even enables a few formerly <code>@system</code> (the opposite of <code>@safe</code>) tricks to be written in a safe way. That fix is DIP1000. It&#8217;s the reason why this example already causes a deprecation warning by default if it&#8217;s compiled with the latest nightly dmd.</p>\n<h2 id="bornfirstdeadlast">Born first, dead last</h2>\n<p>DIP1000 is a set of enhancements to the language rules regarding pointers, slices, and other references. The name stands for <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs">D Improvement Proposal</a> number 1000, <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/other/DIP1000.md">as that document is what</a> the new rules were initially based on. One can enable the new rules with the preview compiler switch, <code>-preview=dip1000</code>. Existing code may need some changes to work with the new rules, which is why the switch is not enabled by default. It&#8217;s going to be the default in the future, so it&#8217;s best to enable it where possible and work to make code compatible with it where not.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is to let people limit the lifetime of a reference (an array or pointer, for example). A pointer to the stack is not dangerous if it does not exist longer than the stack variable it is pointing to. Regular references continue to exist, but they can refer only to data with an unlimited lifetime&mdash;that is, garbage collected memory, or <code>static</code> or global variables.</p>\n<h3 id="letsgetstarted">Let&#8217;s get started</h3>\n<p>The simplest way to construct limited lifetime references is to assign to it something with a limited lifetime.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int* test(int arg1, int arg2)\n{\n    int* notScope = new int(5);\n    int* thisIsScope = &amp;arg1;\n    int* alsoScope; // Not initially scope...\n    alsoScope = thisIsScope; // ...but this makes it so.\n\n    // Error! The variable declared earlier is\n    // considered to have a longer lifetime,\n    // so disallowed.\n    thisIsScope = alsoScope;\n\n    return notScope; // ok\n    return thisIsScope; // error\n    return alsoScope; // error\n}</pre>\n<p>When testing these examples, remember to use the compiler switch <code>-preview=dip1000</code> and to mark the function <code>@safe</code>. The checks are not done for non-<code>@safe</code> functions.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/attribute.html#scope">the <code>scope</code> keyword</a> can be explicitly used to limit the lifetime of a reference.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int[] test()\n{\n    int[] normalRef;\n    scope int[] limitedRef;\n\n    if(true)\n    {\n        int[5] stackData = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5];\n\n        // Lifetime of stackData ends\n        // before limitedRef, so this is\n        // disallowed.\n        limitedRef = stackData[];\n\n        //This is how you do it\n        scope int[] evenMoreLimited\n            = stackData[];\n    }\n\n    return normalRef; // Okay.\n    return limitedRef; // Forbidden.\n}</pre>\n<p>If we can&#8217;t return limited lifetime references, how they are used at all? Easy. Remember, only the address of the data is protected, not the data itself. It means that we have many ways to pass scoped data out of the function.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe int[] fun()\n{\n    scope int[] dontReturnMe = [1,2,3];\n\n    int[] result = new int[](dontReturnMe.length);\n    // This copies the data, instead of having\n    // result refer to protected memory.\n    result[] = dontReturnMe[];\n    return result;\n\n    // Shorthand way of doing the same as above\n    return dontReturnMe.dup;\n\n    // Also you are not always interested\n    // in the contents as a whole; you\n    // might want to calculate something else\n    // from them\n    return\n    [\n        dontReturnMe[0] * dontReturnMe[1],\n        cast(int) dontReturnMe.length\n    ];\n}</pre>\n<h3 id="gettinginterprocedural">Getting interprocedural</h3>\n<p>With the tricks discussed so far, DIP1000 would be restricted to language primitives when handling limited lifetime references, but the <code>scope</code> storage class can be applied to function parameters, too. Because this guarantees the memory won&#8217;t be used after the function exits, local data references can be used as arguments to <code>scope</code> parameters.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe double average(scope int[] data)\n{\n    double result = 0;\n    foreach(el; data) result += el;\n    return result / data.length;\n}\n\n@safe double use()\n{\n    int[10] data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];\n    return data[].average; // works!\n}</pre>\n<p>Initially, it&#8217;s probably best to keep <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#function-attribute-inference">attribute auto inference</a> off. Auto inference in general is a good tool, but it silently adds <code>scope</code> attributes to all parameters it can, meaning it&#8217;s easy to lose track of what&#8217;s happening. That makes the learning process a lot harder. Avoid this by always explicitly specifying the return type (or lack thereof with <code>void</code> or <code>noreturn</code>): <code>@safe const(char[]) fun(int* val)</code> as opposed to <code>@safe auto fun(int* val)</code> or <code>@safe const fun(int* val)</code>. The function also must not be a template or inside a template. We&#8217;ll dig deeper on <code>scope</code> auto inference in a future post.</p>\n<p><code>scope</code> allows handling pointers and arrays that point to the stack, but forbids returning them. What if that&#8217;s the goal? Enter the <code>return scope</code> attribute:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">//Being character arrays, strings also work with DIP1000.\n@safe string latterHalf(return scope string arg)\n{\n    return arg[$/2 .. $];\n}\n\n@safe string test()\n{\n    // allocated in static program memory\n    auto hello1 = "Hello world!";\n    // allocated on the stack, copied from hello1\n    immutable(char)[12] hello2 = hello1;\n\n    auto result1 = hello1.latterHalf; // ok\n    return result1; // ok\n\n    auto result2 = hello2[].latterHalf; // ok\n    // Nice try! result2 is scope and can\'t\n    // be returned.\n    return result2;\n}</pre>\n<p><code>return scope</code> parameters work by checking if any of the arguments passed to them are <code>scope</code>. If so, the return value is treated as a <code>scope</code> value that may not outlive any of the <code>return scope</code> arguments. If none are <code>scope</code>, the return value is treated as a global reference that can be copied freely. Like <code>scope</code>, <code>return scope</code> is conservative. Even if one does not actually return the address protected by <code>return scope</code>, the compiler will still perform the call site lifetime checks just as if one did.</p>\n<h3 id="scopeisshallow"><code>scope</code> is shallow</h3>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void test()\n{\n    scope a = "first";\n    scope b = "second";\n    string[] arr = [a, b];\n}</pre>\n<p>In <code>test</code>, initializing <code>arr</code> does not compile. This may be surprising given that the language automatically adds <code>scope</code> to a variable on initialization if needed.</p>\n<p>However, consider what the <code>scope</code> on <code>scope string[] arr</code> would protect. There are two things it could potentially protect: the addresses of the strings in the array, or the addresses of the characters in the strings. For this assignment to be safe, <code>scope</code> would have to protect the characters in the strings, but it only protects the top-level reference, i.e., the strings in the array. Thus, the example does not work. Now change <code>arr</code> so that it&#8217;s a static array:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">@safe void test()\n{\n    scope a = "first";\n    scope b = "second";\n    string[2] arr = [a, b];\n}</pre>\n<p>This works because static arrays are not references. Memory for all of their elements is allocated in place on the stack (i.e., they <em>contain</em> their elements), as opposed to dynamic arrays which contain a reference to elements stored elsewhere. When a static array is <code>scope</code>, its elements are treated as <code>scope</code>. And since the example would not compile were <code>arr</code> not <code>scope</code>, it follows that <code>scope</code> is inferred.</p>\n<h2 id="somepracticaltips">Some practical tips</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it, the DIP1000 rules take time to understand, and many would rather spend that time coding something useful. The first and most important tip is: avoid non-<code>@safe</code> code like the plague if doable. Of course, this advice is not new, but it appears even more important with DIP1000. In a nutshell, the language does not check the validity of <code>scope</code> and <code>return scope</code> in a non-<code>@safe</code> function, <em>but</em> when calling those functions the compiler assumes that the attributes are respected.</p>\n<p>This makes <code>scope</code> and <code>return scope</code> terrible footguns in unsafe code. But by resisting the temptation to mark code <code>@trusted</code> to avoid thinking, a D coder can hardly do damage. Misusing DIP1000 in <code>@safe</code> code can cause needless compilation errors, but it won&#8217;t corrupt memory and is unlikely to cause other bugs either.</p>\n<p>A second important point worth mentioning is that there is no need for <code>scope</code> and <code>return scope</code> for function attributes if they receive only static or GC-allocated data. Many langauges do not let coders refer to the stack at all; just because D programmers can do so does not mean they must. This way, they don&#8217;t have to spend any more time solving compiler errors than they did before DIP1000. And if a desire to work with the stack arises after all, the authors can then return to annotate the functions. Most likely they will accomplish this without breaking the interface.</p>\n<h2 id="whatsnext">What&#8217;s next?</h2>\n<p>This concludes today&#8217;s blog post. This is enough to know how to use arrays and pointers with DIP1000. In principle, it also enables readers to use DIP1000 with classes and interfaces. The only thing to learn is that a class reference, including the <code>this</code> pointer in member functions, works with DIP1000 just like a pointer would. Still, it&#8217;s hard to grasp what that means from one sentence, so later posts shall illustrate the subject.</p>\n<p>In any case, there is more to know. DIP1000 has some features for <code>ref</code> function parameters, structs, and unions that we didn&#8217;t cover here. We&#8217;ll also dig deeper on how DIP1000 plays with non-<code>@safe</code> functions and attribute auto inference. Currently, the plan is to do two more posts for this series.</p>\n<p>Do let us know in the comment section or the D forums if you have any useful DIP1000 tips that were not covered!</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Walter Bright for reviewing this article.</em></p>'}]}

Early on, a major milestone release of GDC, the GCC-based D compiler, hit the virtual shelves. It was followed in middle of the month by the release of D 2.100.0 along with a DMD release, the reference D compiler, of the same version.

Finally, the latter half of the month saw <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#schedule">the publication of the DConf &#8217;22 schedule</a>, we found a sponsor for the DConf tradition of BeerConf, and May 31st marks <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#register">the final day of DConf &#8217;22 early-bird registration</a>.</p>\n<p><em>A video version of this blog post is available on <a href="https://youtu.be/qTH1S6z-n-s">the D Language Foundation YouTube channel</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id="d2.100.0">D 2.100.0</h2>\n<p><a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html">This latest release of DMD</a> comes to us courtesy of 41 contributors who brought us 22 major changes and 179 fixed Bugzilla issues. Although the community attached a bit of significance to the 2.100.0 version number, there isn&#8217;t anything overly exciting in the changelog. This is largely a house-cleaning release&mdash;a number of deprecation periods that should have already ended have been terminated&mdash; but there are a couple of interesting additions to the language.</p>\n<h3 id="d1-styleopertatoroverloading">D1-style operator overloading</h3>\n<p>One of these is <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html#d1_style_operators">the deprecation of D1-style operator overloads</a>. Originally, these were designed to make their purpose clear. Want to overload the addition operator? Then implement <code>opAdd</code>. What to overload the multiplication operator? Then implement <code>opMul</code>. Walter took this approach with operator overloading because of one of the major complaints about the feature in C++: people often overload an operator to do something different from what it is expected to do. An example: overloading the <code>+</code> operator to append rather than perform addition. Walter&#8217;s reasoning was that if the intent of the operator is included in the name of the function, then anyone overloading it to do something different is essentially violating its contract. Perhaps it would encourage people to stick to the intent.</p>\n<p>No one can say for sure if Walter&#8217;s approach worked like he hoped, but <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/operatoroverloading.html">a more generic design was implemented in D2</a>, and this is the approach all D code must use today. The D1 operators were kept around largely to ease porting D1 code to D2, with the intention that they would one day be deprecated. <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.088.0.html">It finally happened in D 2.088.0</a>, which was released in the fall of 2019. <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/accepted/DIP1013.md">Following the deprecation process</a>, the deprecation period should have ended with 2.098.0 (the first release after 10 non-patch releases including the deprecation).</p>\n<h3 id="delete">delete</h3>\n<p>The <code>delete</code> keyword was another D1 feature that was ultimately axed in D2. It <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.079.0.html">was deprecated in D 2.079.0</a>, which was released in the spring of 2018. This was something that had long been planned (<a href="https://dlang.org/deprecate.html#delete">see the deprecation page for the rationale</a>), and its use had been discouraged for some time.</p>\n<p>N<code>delete</code> would both destroy an object instance (call its destructors) and release the memory allocated for it by the GC. Now, we use the <code>destroy</code> function from the <code>object</code> module which is imported by default in all D programs. This will call the destructor on an instance and optionally reset the instance to its default <code>.init</code> state. The GC will then free the memory allocated for the instance when necessary, or the programmer can do it manually via <code>GC.free</code> static member function in <code>core.memory</code>.</p>\n<h3 id="mustuse">@mustuse</h3>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/accepted/DIP1038.md">Paul Backus took DIP 1038</a> through the review process from beginning to end. Initially, it introduced an <code>@nodiscard</code> attribute for functions and types. During the Formal Assessment after the review rounds were completed, Walter and Átila were willing to approve it with changes. The final version renamed the attribute to <code>@mustUse</code> and restricted its application to structs and unions.</p>\n<p><a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html#mustUse">The feature was implemented in D 2.100.0</a> as <code>@mustuse</code>, and is now available to use in your D code. When a type marked with the attribute is the result of an expression, the result cannot be ignored.</p>\n<h3 id=".tupleofforstaticarrays">.tupleof for static arrays</h3>\n<p>Many D programmers are familiar with the <code>.tupleof</code> property of structs, which is particularly useful when interfacing with C libraries:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Circle {\n    float x, y;\n    float radius;\n    ubyte r, g, b, a;\n}\n\n@nogc nothrow\nextern(C) void draw_circle (\n    float cx, float cy, float radius,\n    ubyte r, ubyte g, ubyte b, ubyte a\n);\n\nvoid foo() {\n    Circle c = makeCircle();\n    draw_circle(c.tupleof);\n}</pre>\n<p>Now we can <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.100.0.html#static_array_tupleof">do the same thing with static arrays</a>:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void foo(int, int, int) { /* ... */ }\n\nint[3] ia = [1, 2, 3];\nfoo(ia.tupleof); // same as `foo(1, 2, 3);\n\nfloat[3] fa;\n//fa = ia; // error\nfa.tupleof = ia.tupleof;\nassert(fa == [1F, 2F, 3F]);</pre>\n<h2 id="dconf22">DConf &#8217;22</h2>\n<p>DConf &#8217;22 is happening in London, August 1&nbsp;4.

The schedule is online and BeerConf is a go!</p>\n<h3 id="dconf22schedule">DConf &#8217;22 schedule</h3>\n<p>We love to see and hear first-time speakers at DConf, whether it&#8217;s their first conference talk ever or their first DConf talk. This year, we have 11 first-time DConf speakers, 12 if you include our invited keynote speaker Roberto Ierusalimschy (<a href="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/en/teacher/@roberto-ierusalimschy">the head designer of the Lua programming language</a>). This is awesome!</p>\n<p><a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#schedule">The DConf &#8217;22 schedule</a> is set up as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>three keynotes: two from the language maintainers, one from our guest speaker</li>\n<li>two panels: the traditional DConf Ask Us Anything involving the language maintainers, and a panel on Programming Language Design</li>\n<li>a Lightning Talks session</li>\n<li>15 presentations (11 of which are from first-time DConf speakers)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We&#8217;re limiting the talks to 45 minutes this year so that we&#8217;ll have more time to mingle between sessions. One of the talks on Day 3 is slated for 25&#8211;30 minutes, so we&#8217;ve slotted it such that we have a longer lunch that day.</p>\n<p>The schedule (excluding the keynotes, as the details of those haven&#8217;t yet been provided) has a loose theme. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;ll do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Day One is mostly status reports and tutorials</li>\n<li>Day Two is largely intermediate to advanced and heavy on the tech</li>\n<li>Day Three is about the D ecosystem</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the talks will be livestreamed and recorded, so they&#8217;ll be available on our YouTube channel at some point after the conference has ended. Still, DConf is about more than just the talks, <a href="https://youtu.be/nvo7wzjVDQc">as Razvan Nitu and Dennis Korpel noted in an interview</a>. It&#8217;s about getting to know in person the people we encounter online in our regular D community interactions. As Razvan said and I can attest, your perspective will surely change after you can match the internet handles with living, breathing, human beings with whom you&#8217;ve interacted in person.</p>\n<p><a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#register">So register</a>!</p>\n<h3 id="early-birdregistrationends">Early-bird registration ends</h3>\n<p><a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#register">May 31st is the last day of early-bird registration</a>.

We can&#8217;t help you with transportation, just the registration.</p>\n<h3 id="beerconf">BeerConf</h3>\n<p>BeerConf is a DConf tradition going back to the very beginning, though we didn&#8217;t call it that back then. Every year, we would designate an &#8220;official&#8221; hotel somewhere in the vicinity of the venue. This would be our gathering spot in the evenings, usually in the hotel lobby or bar. Typically, would people break off into groups for dinner, then several of them would wander over to the gathering spot to hang out and chat, usually over beers. At DConf 2017, Ethan Watson branded this gathering BeerConf and the name has stuck.</p>\n<p>At DConf 2019 in London, we couldn&#8217;t find a suitable hotel to select as the site of BeerConf. Instead, we hired out the upper floor of a pub close to the venue, thanks to the sponsorship of Mercedes Benz Research and Development North America. For DConf &#8217;22, we&#8217;re back in the same general area, and so we again have to hire out a pub.</p>\n<p>The 2019 pub was a bit crowded for us, and is a bit too far of a walk from our &#8217;22 venue, so we&#8217;ve got our eyes on another pub within walking distance of the venue and near <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#venue">some of the budget hotels listed at dconf.org</a>. What we&#8217;ve been missing is funding.</p>\n<p>That has changed, <a href="https://funkwerk.com/en/?noredirect=en-US">thanks to Funkwerk</a>! With their sponsorship, we&#8217;re able to cover the minimum spend the pub asks for the each of the evenings of August 1&nbsp;3. This means that DConf attendees dropping by this pub on those nights can order food and drinks (alcoholic and or otherwise) for free until the DConf tab runs out. We&#8217;ll have a separate tab for each night so that we don&#8217;t blow it all in one go.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t announce the specifics about the pub just yet. <a href="https://symmetryinvestments.com/">Our DConf host, Symmetry Investments</a>, is handling the arrangements for us since they&#8217;re in London and we aren&#8217;t. Once I receive confirmation that the deal is set, I&#8217;ll announce all of the details in the forums, here on the blog, and at dconf.org. So keep your ears open!</p>\n<p>Thanks again to Funkwerk for helping us out.</p>\n<h2 id="nexttime">Next time</h2>\n<p>The next big news roundup will come in late August or early September, but I&#8217;ll keep the blog updated with announcements before DConf as they come. If you are planning to attend DConf, then I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing you in London. And if you aren&#8217;t, then change your plans!</p>'}]}

Three of them were unable to make it to the end. So it came down to two: Teodor Dutu and Luís Ferreira. Teodor was working on converting DRuntime hooks to templates, and Luís on getting support for D into LLDB, the LLVM debugger.</p>\n<p>SAOC is sponsored by Symmetry Investments. Each year, participants promise to work on their projects at least 20 hours per week across four month-long milestones. At the end of each of the first three milestones, a panel of judges evaluates their progress to decide if they pass or fail. A passing participant is awarded a $1000 payment and allowed to continue in the next milestone. A failing participant might be given a reduced payment or none at all, and removed from the event or given a warning, depending on the circumstances leading to the failure. At the end of the fourth milestone, the judges evaluate the overall progress of each participant across the entire event and select one to receive a final $1000 payment and a free trip to DConf.</p>\n<p>For the first time in four editions of the event, the SOAC 2021 judges were unable to agree on who should receive the final rewards. It was a three-judge panel, each of whom is a veteran of every edition of SAOC: Jon Colvin, Átila Neves, and Robert Schadek. Two of them split, and the third felt there wasn&#8217;t enough to make either of the two participants stand out above the other. Teodor and Luís both did their work, wrote detailed milestone reports, and kept up with their forum updates to the same degree. So the conflicted judge took a proposal to Laeeth Isharc of Symmetry: why not award both candidates the final payment and the DConf trip?</p>\n<p>Congratulations to Teodor and Luís on being the first dual recipients of the final SAOC reward. They have continued working on their projects, and we look forward to seeing the work they do in the future. Thanks to all of the SAOC participants, mentors, and judges, and to Symmetry Investments for sponsoring the event every year.</p>\n<h2 id="thenewpullrequestandissuemanager">The New Pull Request and Issue Manager</h2>\n<p>For over a year, Razvan Nitu has been working hard at closing Bugzilla issues and merging pull requests in his role as our Pull Request and Issue Manager. His position is sponsored by Symmetry Investments, which provided funding for two such positions. Unfortunately, real-world circumstances conspired to prevent the person selected for the second position from filling it, so it remained vacant through most of 2021.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of this year, Symmetry committed to continuing funding for both positions (as well as a different position, that of my assistant, filled by Max Haughton). In January, we put out a call for applications. In February, we announced that Dennis Korpel was selected for the job. His proven track record as a volunteer contributor to the core D repositories made him the top contender.</p>\n<p>Dennis officially started his new job on March 1, and he hit the ground running.

That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re here for.</p>\n<p>One way you can do that is by tweeting the issue number along with <strong>#dbugfix</strong>. We initiated this hashtag a while back so that D users could bring attention to specific issues, but then the hard part was finding someone with the time and inclination to fix it. Now, with both Razvan and Dennis paid to make sure issues get fixed, the hard part is a lot easier. You can also post about issues in the forums or email social@dlang.org, and I will make sure that they see it.</p>\n<p>Razvan and Dennis have their criteria for deciding their priorities in the absence of input, but if you bring an issue or PR to their attention, they will work to resolve it as quickly as they can.</p>\n<h2 id="d2.099.0">D 2.099.0</h2>\n<p>Version 2.099.0 of DMD, the reference D compiler, was released on March 6. This is a <em>massive</em> release, containing 20 major changes and 221 closed Bugzilla issues from 100 contributors. Some highlights from this release: D modules can be imported into C code via ImportC; D now has <em>throw expressions</em>; and PE/COFF output is now the default in DMD on Windows. <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.099.0.html">See the changelog</a> for the complete list.</p>\n<h3 id="importmodulesincsourcecodewithimportc">Import modules in C source code with ImportC</h3>\n<p>ImportC is proving to be a valuable addition to D. Once all the kinks are ironed out and a solution for handling C preprocessor directives is implemented, the need for bindings to C libraries will largely disappear&mdash;you&#8217;ll be able to bring C headers, and compile C source files, directly into your D programs without any external tools.</p>\n<p>As of D 2.099.0, you can also <a href="https://dlang.org/changelog/2.099.0.html#__import">bring D modules directly into C files</a> via the <code>__import</code> keyword.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// dsayhello.d\nimport core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nextern(C) void helloImport() {\n    puts(&quot;Hello __import!&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">// dhelloimport.c\n__import dsayhello;\n__import core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    helloImport();\n    puts(&quot;Cool, eh?&quot;);\n    return 0;\n}</pre>\n<p>Compile with:</p>\n<pre>dmd dhelloimport.c dsayhello.d</pre>\n<p>You can also use it to import C modules that have been compiled via ImportC:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">// csayhello.c\n__import core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nvoid helloImport() {\n    puts(&quot;Hello _import!&quot;);\n}</pre>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-c_cpp">// chelloimport.c\n__import csayhello;\n__import core.stdc.stdio : puts;\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    helloImport();\n    puts(&quot;Cool, eh?&quot;);\n    return 0;\n}</pre>\n<p>Compile with:</p>\n<pre>dmd chelloimport.c csayhello.c</pre>\n<h3 id="thethrowexpressionhasbeenimplemented">The throw expression has been implemented</h3>\n<p>For all of D&#8217;s lifetime, <code>throw</code> has been a statement and only a statement. It couldn&#8217;t be used in expressions because expressions must have a type, and since <code>throw</code> doesn&#8217;t return a value, there was no suitable type. This prevented it from being used with the following syntax:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">(string err) =&gt; throw new Exception(err);</pre>\n<p>And required this form instead:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">(string err) { throw new Exception(err); }</pre>\n<p>DIP 1034, which introduced a bottom type to the language, <a href="https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/accepted/DIP1034.md#flow-analysis-across-functions">provided the means to enable throw expressions</a>: when &#8220;a throw statement is seen as an expression returning a bottom type&#8221;. As of D 2.099.0, <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/expression.html#throw_expression">the following code snippet compiles</a>:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void foo(int function() f) {}\n\nvoid main() {\n    foo(() =&gt; throw new Exception());\n}</pre>\n<h3 id="pecoffisthedefaultdmdoutputonwindows">PE/COFF is the default DMD output on Windows</h3>\n<p>For many years, DMD outputs object files in the OMF format on Windows. There&#8217;s a story behind this, a large part of it related to the culture of software development on Windows, but it can be summarized in two bullet points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Walter Bright already had a C compiler backend that generated OMF output, a license to distribute OMF link libraries for the Win32 API, and a linker that understands OMF (OPTLINK).</li>\n<li>There was no de facto system linker on Windows when he started working on D in 1999, so he could not rely on a specific linker being installed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reusing the compiler backend and the linker allowed Walter to distribute DMD as a compiler that worked out of the box, without the need to install any further development tools. He felt this was important for D&#8217;s early adoption. The downside was that it also restricted DMD on Windows to 32-bit. Eventually, he had to support PE/COFF and require the Microsoft linker in order to support 64-bit output, and he implemented PE/COFF 32-bit at the same time, but he was adamant that DMD continue to work out of the box for those who didn&#8217;t want to install the Microsoft Build Tools (for the linker) and Windows SDK (for the Win32 link libraries).</p>\n<p>Eventually, OPTLINK started showing its age. Linker errors became more common as D codebases grew. There were calls to enable PE/COFF by default. Finally, someone raised the idea of shipping <a href="https://lld.llvm.org/">the LLVM linker, LLD</a>, along with link libraries generated from <a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">the MinGW project</a>. This would allow DMD to eventually default to PE/COFF while maintaining the out-of-the-box experience.</p>\n<p>DMD has been shipping with LLD for several releases, and it seems enough of the kinks have been worked out that it has been ready to become the default for a while now. Nicholas Wilson finally took the step to make that happen, Walter eventually gave it his blessing, and now PE/COFF is the default DMD output on Windows.</p>\n<p>Practically, this means that the <code>-m32mscoff</code> switch has been deprecated, <code>-m32</code> now specifies PE/COFF, and the new switch <code>-m32omf</code> can be used to produce OMF output if needed (but its OMF support will eventually be dropped). The <code>-m64</code> switch has always produced PE/COFF output, so has not changed.</p>\n<h3 id="ldc">LDC</h3>\n<p>The beta release of LDC 1.29.0 <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/post/tgvvhqvyugfrsdhuhiyo@forum.dlang.org">was announced on March 10</a>. This version of the LLVM-based D compiler is based on D 2.099.0+. It includes support for LLVM 13, no longer defaults to the <code>ld.gold</code> linker on Linux (LLD is recommended), and includes a breaking change for the <code>extern(D)</code> ABI.

We&#8217;re excited that he&#8217;s able to join us. Several D community members have used or are using Lua in their D projects, including the gas dynamics toolkit at the University of Queensland that <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/2022/02/02/a-gas-dynamics-toolkit-in-d/">its maintainers wrote about on this blog</a>. (You can also count me in that group.

The base early-bird rate is $352.75 ($423.30 after applying 20% VAT), which is 15% off the general registration of $415 ($498 with 20% VAT). We offer a student discount, a discount for major open source contributors, and a hardship rate. You can <a href="https://dconf.org/2022/index.html#register">register now or learn about the discounted rates at dconf.org</a>.</p>\n<h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>\n<p>At past editions of DConf, we&#8217;ve allotted talks in 50-minute blocks with 10-minute breaks in between. This year, we&#8217;re cutting that down: we&#8217;d like to keep the talks no longer than 40&ndash;45 minutes. Part of the magic of DConf is the time spent interacting face-to-face with other D enthusiasts, so it only makes sense to make as much room for that as we can while still allowing for educational and informative presentations.</p>\n<p>If you have something related to the D programming language that you&#8217;d like to share with the world, please send in a submission. Don&#8217;t know what to talk about? Then heed Ali Çehreli, <a href="https://youtu.be/E-78QqeDfI8?t=21">from one of his DConf Online 2020 Q &amp; A sessions</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nComing up with an idea for a talk is as simple as the way you use D. Just look at your code, and it makes a presentation&#8230;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you have used the D programming language, then you have material for a talk: describe your project; talk about specific problems you solved or interesting ways in which you&#8217;ve employed language features; expound on the ups and downs of your experience learning D so that others can benefit; and so on. Take a look at the DConf and DConf Online talks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDLanguageFoundation/playlists">available on our YouTube channel</a> for inspiration. Even if you&#8217;ve never presented at a conference, we encourage you to send us a submission! Several D community members have given their first presentation at DConf, and we are always happy to see more.</p>\n<p>The worst that can happen when you submit a talk is that it isn&#8217;t accepted. But if it <em>is</em> accepted, then you&#8217;ll be entitled to reimbursement for your transportation to and from London, and your lodging for the five nights of the conference. You get to hang out with people who share your interest in D and most of your expenses are covered, with nothing to lose if your talk isn&#8217;t accepted.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let doubt or hesitation hold you back.

All of our talks will be in their CTRL room on the first floor, and we&#8217;ll have the basement ESC room to ourselves for mingling between talks and during lunch. They have table tennis and foosball tables, and plenty of space in which to chill.</p>\n<p>CodeNode isn&#8217;t far from our DConf 2019 venue, so the same budget hotels we stayed at then are also within walking distance this year.

Many attendees would take rooms there, and a number of us would gather in the evenings in the hotel lobby or bar to chat over drinks and snacks. In one of our Berlin editions, Ethan Watson coined the term &#8220;BeerConf&#8221; to refer to these evening meetups. In 2019, we couldn&#8217;t find a suitable hotel in which to gather, so we hired space in a pub near the venue. When DConf was canceled in 2020, a couple of community members hosted an online BeerConf to make up for the loss of the real-world version, and <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Beerconf">they&#8217;ve been hosting it every month since</a>.</p>\n<p>This year, since we&#8217;re back in the same part of London, we&#8217;re again looking for a space we can rent for BeerConf. We&#8217;ve got our eyes on a couple of spaces, and we&#8217;re working to secure funding. I hope to have an update on that before the end of April.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, keep an eye on <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/group/announce">the D Announce forum</a> for news of our monthly online version of BeerConf, and consider picking up a BeerConf shirt from <a href="https://www.zazzle.com/store/dlang_swag?rf=238129799288374326">our DLang Swag Emporium</a>!</p>\n<h2 id="lookingahead">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to the rest of 2022. One of our big goals for this year is to lay the groundwork for bringing more structure and organization to the D ecosystem. The PR/Issue managers have made a big difference and brought order to a chaotic contribution process, but we still have a long way to get to where we&#8217;d like to be.</p>\n<p>Soon, I&#8217;ll start publishing tutorials on the foundation&#8217;s YouTube channel. These tutorials are going to cover more than just the language syntax and semantics. They&#8217;ll also dive into the tools we use as D programmers: compilers, linkers, loaders, object files, etc. These days, it&#8217;s not unsual for a programmer new to D to have gone years without ever touching a programming language that uses the same compile-link model. Questions about static linking errors, or confusion about compiler vs. linker errors, are not uncommon. These tutorials will be short and focused on specific topics, and will hopefully serve as a means for new D programmers to up their game with the tools they use.</p>\n<p>Once I&#8217;ve uploaded the tutorials, I&#8217;ll apply for our channel to join the YouTube Partner Program so that we can start raising money from the channel. We&#8217;re eligible now, but I don&#8217;t want to apply until I&#8217;ve established a more frequent pattern of updates.</p>\n<p>On that note, I&#8217;d like to remind you that the D Language Foundation is available to select as a charity for the Amazon Smile program.

They allow the programmer to generate efficient and correct code at compile time. Long gone are the days of preprocessor macros or handwritten, per-type data structures. D templates, though designed in the shadow of C++ templates, were not made in their image. D makes templates cleaner and more expressive, and also enables patterns like &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdzwvY8Mo-w">Design by Introspection</a>&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Here is a simple example of a template that would require the use of preprocessor macros in C or C++:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template sizeOfTypeByName(string name)\n{\n  enum sizeOfTypeByName = mixin(name, ".sizeof");\n}\nunittest\n{\n  assert(sizeOfTypeByName!"int" == 4);\n}</pre>\n<p>D&#8217;s templates are powerful tools but should not be used unthinkingly. Carelessness could result in long compile times or excessive code generation.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I introduce some simple concepts that can help in writing templates that minimize resource usage. Deeper intuition can also lead to the discovery of new abstractions or increased confidence in existing ones.</p>\n<h2 id="readthememo">Read the memo</h2>\n<p>The D compiler memoizes template instantiations: if I instantiate <code>MyTemplate!int</code> once, the compiler produces an AST for that instantiation; if I instantiate that exact template again, the previous computation is reused.</p>\n<p>As a demonstration, let&#8217;s write a generic addition function and use <code>pragma(msg, ...)</code> to print the number of instantiations at compile time. I&#8217;m going to use it twice with integers and twice with floating point numbers.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto genericAdd(T)(const T x, const T y)\n{\n  pragma(msg, "genericAdd instantiated with ", T);\n  return x + y;\n}\n\n// Instantiate with int\nwriteln(genericAdd!int(4, 5));\nwriteln(genericAdd!int(6, 1));\n\n// Now for the float type\nwriteln(genericAdd!float(24.0, 32.0));\nwriteln(genericAdd!float(0.0, float.nan));</pre>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s compile the code and look at what our <code>pragma(msg, )</code> says about template instantiations in the compiler.</p>\n<pre>dmd -c generic_add.d</pre>\n<p>This yields the following output during compilation:</p>\n<pre>genericAdd instantiated with int\ngenericAdd instantiated with float</pre>\n<p>We can see <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> as we expected, but notice that each is only mentioned once. Newcomers to languages with templates or generics can sometimes mistakenly think that using a template requires a potentially expensive instantiation on every use in the source code. For the benefit of those new users of D, the above is categoric proof that this is not the case; you <em>cannot</em> pay twice for templates you have already asked the compiler to instantiate. (You can, however, convince yourself that you <em>are</em> asking the compiler to do something it&#8217;s already done when you in fact are not. We&#8217;ll go over contrived and real-world examples of this later in this article.)</p>\n<p>The benefit of this feature should be obvious, but what may not be obvious is how it can be employed in writing templates. Within the bounds of our desire for ergonomics, we should design the <em>interfaces</em> of our templates to maximize the number of identical instantiations.</p>\n<h2 id="whatsinaname">What&#8217;s in a name?</h2>\n<p>The following example, adapted from a real-world change to a large D project, yielded a reduction in compile time of a few percent for unit-test builds.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we have an expensive template whose behavior we want to test over a simple type. Our type might be:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Vector3\n{\n  float x;\n  float y;\n  float z;\n}</pre>\n<p>To demonstrate the phenomenon, we don&#8217;t have to do anything fancy, so we&#8217;ll just declare a stub called <code>send</code>.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// Let\'s say this sends a value of type T to a database.\nvoid send(T)(T x);</pre>\n<p><strong>A note on syntax:</strong> Given a variable <code>val</code> of type <code>int</code>, this template could be explicitly instantiated as <code>send!(int)(val)</code>. However, the compiler can infer the type <code>T</code>, so we can instantiate it as if it were a normal function call as <code>send(val)</code>. Using D&#8217;s <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#pseudo-member">Uniform Function Call Syntax</a>, we could alternatively call it like a property or member, as <code>val.send()</code> (the approach used in the following example), or even <code>val.send</code>, since parentheses are optional in function calls when there are no arguments.</p>\n<p>Our test might then be something like:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct Vector3\n{\n  float x;\n  float y;\n  float z;\n}\n\nunittest\n{\n  Vector3 value;\n  value.send();\n}</pre>\n<p>This is reasonable so far. However, an issue arises when we start to write more than one test. Should we want to test different behaviors of a fancy template, but instantiate it with the same type, then we end up spending more time in compilation than we would have expected. A lot more time. And we see large growth in the number of symbols emitted in the resulting binary, resulting in a larger file size than one would expect. Why is that?</p>\n<p>Despite our intuition that the compiler should consider multiple declarations of a type like <code>Vector3</code> in multiple <code>unittest</code> blocks as identical, it actually does not. We can demonstrate this effect with an extremely simple example. We&#8217;ll provide an implementation of <code>send</code> that prints at compile time the type of each instantiation. Then <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/version.html#staticforeach">we&#8217;ll use <code>static foreach</code></a> to generate five distinct implementations of a single unit test.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void send(T)(T x)\n{\n  pragma(msg, T); \n}\n\n// Generate 5 unittest blocks\nstatic foreach(_; 0..5)\n{\n  unittest\n  {\n    struct JustInt\n    {\n      int x;\n    }\n    JustInt value;\n    value.send;\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>This results in the following output from the compiler:</p>\n<pre>JustInt\nJustInt\nJustInt\nJustInt\nJustInt</pre>\n<p>Huh? Doesn&#8217;t this violate our &#8220;you can&#8217;t pay twice&#8221; rule? If you were to take this output from the compiler as gospel, then yes, but there&#8217;s a more subtle truth here.</p>\n<h2 id="fullyqualifiednames">Fully qualified names</h2>\n<p>The name of a type as you would write it in your editor is not the complete name of a type. Let&#8217;s amend the implementation of <code>send</code> to print the return value of a template called <code>fullyQualifiedName</code> rather than printing <code>T</code> directly. The rest of the example remains the same.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void send(T)(T x)\n{\n  import std.traits : fullyQualifiedName;\n  pragma(msg, fullyQualifiedName!T); \n}</pre>\n<p>Assuming the module is named <code>example</code>, this yields something like:</p>\n<pre>example.__unittest_L13_C3_1.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_2.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_3.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_4.JustInt\nexample.__unittest_L13_C3_5.JustInt</pre>\n<p>This explains our previous conundrum. By declaring the type <em>locally</em> in each test, we have actually declared a new type per test, each of which results in a new instantiation.</p>\n<p>A type&#8217;s fully qualified name includes the name of its enclosing scope (<code>{package-name.}module-name.{scope-name(s).}TypeName</code>). The compiler rewrites each <code>unittest</code> as a unique function with a generated name. We have five unique functions, each with its own local, distinct declaration of a <code>JustInt</code> type. And so we end up with five distinct types.</p>\n<p>We want to ensure that one instantiation is reused across <code>unittest</code> blocks. We do that by moving the declaration of <code>JustInt</code> to module scope, outside of the unit tests.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct JustInt\n{\n  int x;\n}\n\nstatic foreach(_; 0..5)\n{\n  unittest\n  {\n    JustInt value;\n    value.send;\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>The <code>send</code> template now prints:</p>\n<pre>example.JustInt</pre>\n<p>Much better.</p>\n<h3 id="someharddata">Some hard data</h3>\n<p>To collect some anecdata about the usefulness of these changes, we&#8217;ll look at compilation times and the size of compiled binaries. Since this template is <em>very</em> trivial, let&#8217;s generate a hundred copies of the same <code>unittest</code> rather than five so we can see a trend.</p>\n<p>On my system, timing the compilation of our programs shows the locally declared types took <strong>243ms</strong> to compile, but the version with a single global type declaration took <strong>159ms</strong> to compile. A difference of <strong>84ms</strong> is not all that much, sure, but in a large codebase, there may be <em>a lot</em> of these speedups waiting to be found. Any reduction in compile times is to be embraced, especially when it&#8217;s cumulative.</p>\n<p>As for binary size, I saw a savings of <code>69K</code> on disk. The quantity of machine code generated by the compiler is worth keeping a close eye on. Larger binaries mean more work for the linker, which in turn means more time waiting for builds to complete. The easiest job is the one you don&#8217;t have to do.</p>\n<h2 id="amorecomplexexample">A more complex example</h2>\n<p>The following example demonstrates a very simple but fundamental change to a template that yields an enormous improvement in compile times and other metrics.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we have a fairly simple interpreter, and we want to expose functions in our D code to the scripts executed by our interpreter. We can do that with some sort of registration function, which we&#8217;ll call <code>register</code>.</p>\n<h3 id="thesignatureoftheregisterfunction">The signature of the register function</h3>\n<p>To prove the point I&#8217;m discussing, we don&#8217;t need to implement this function&mdash;its <em>interface</em> is what can cause a big slow down.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say our <code>register</code> function looks like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">// Context is something our hypothetical interpreter works with\nvoid register(alias func, string registeredName)(Context x); </pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty reasonable, right? It takes a template alias parameter that specifies the function to call (a common idiom in D) and a template value parameter of type <code>string</code> that represents the name of the function as it is exposed to scripts. The implementation of <code>register</code> will presumably map the value of <code>registeredName</code> to the <code>func</code> alias, and then scripts can call the function using that value. Functions can be registered with, e.g., the following:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">\ncontext = createAContext();\ncontext.register!(writeln!string, "writeln")();</pre>\n<p>The scripts can call the Phobos <code>writeln</code> function template using the name <code>writeln</code>.</p>\n<h3 id="thecompile-timeperformanceoftheregistertemplate">The compile-time performance of the register template</h3>\n<p>The interface for <code>register</code> looks harmless, but it turns out that it has a significant impact on compile time. We can test this by registering some random functions. The actual contents of the functions don&#8217;t matter&mdash;this article is about template compile times, so we just want a baseline figure for roughly how much time the infrastructure templates take to compile rather than the code they are hooking together.</p>\n<p>Although we will pull the functions out of a hat, the thing that will drive our intuition is to realize that a small number of interfaces will likely be reused many times. We could start with a basket of interface stubs like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">int stub1(string) { return 1; }\n\nint stub2(string) { return 2; }\n\nint stub3(string) { return 3; }\n\n// etc.</pre>\n<p>More broadly, with a bunch of functions that have identical signatures and a bunch of functions with random parameter lists and return types, we can get a rough baseline. With the set of stubs I used, compile times ended up at roughly <strong>5</strong> seconds.</p>\n<p>So what happens if we move the compile-time parameters to run time? Since <code>registeredName</code> is a template value parameter, we can just move it into the function parameter list with no change. We have to handle the <code>func</code> parameter differently. Almost any symbol can bind at compile time to a template alias parameter, but symbols can&#8217;t bind at run time to function parameters. We have to use a function pointer instead. In that case, we can use the type of the referenced function as a template parameter.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">void register(FuncType)(Context x, FuncType ptr, string registeredName);</pre>\n<p>With this signature, the compile time drops to roughly <strong>1</strong> second.</p>\n<h3 id="whatsgoingon">What&#8217;s going on?</h3>\n<p>D is a fairly fast language to compile. Good decisions have been made over the lifetime of the language to make that possible. It is also the case that one can happily write slow-to-compile D code. Although we are choosing to ignore the compilation speeds of the non-infrastructure code to simplify the point being made, this can actually (in a certain sense) be the case in real projects, too. As such it is worthwhile to pay attention not to the quantity of metaprogramming being done <em>semantically</em> but rather the quantity of metaprogramming being performed <em>by the compiler</em>.</p>\n<p>In this case, with the first interface used for <code>register</code>, the compiler had no opportunity to reuse any instantiations. Because it accepted the registered functions as symbols, each instantiation was unique. By shifting instead to take the <em>type</em> of the registered function as a template parameter and a pointer to the function as a function parameter, the compiler could reuse instantiations. <code>stub1</code>, <code>stub2</code>, and <code>stub3</code> are distinct symbols, but they each have the same type of (<code>int function(string)</code>).</p>\n<p>To be clear, this is not an indictment of template alias parameters. There are good use cases for them (the Phobos algorithms API is an example). The point of this example is to show how the compile-time costs of unique template instantiations can be hidden. A decision about the trade-offs between compile-time and run-time performance can only be made if the programmer is aware there is a decision to make. So when implementing a template, consider how it will be used. If it&#8217;s going to end up creating many unique instantiations, then you can weigh the benefits of keeping that interface versus redesigning it to maximize reuse.</p>\n<h2 id="afalsefriend">A false friend</h2>\n<p>In linguistics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend">a false friend</a> is a pair of words from two different languages that look the same but have different meanings. I&#8217;m going to abuse this term by using it to refer to a pair of programming patterns that actually result in the same program behavior, but via different routes through the language implementation, i.e., one of these patterns has, say, worse performance or compile times than the other.</p>\n<h3 id="asimpleexample:">A simple example:</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we have a library that exposes a template as part of its API, like this one that prints a string when a module is loaded during run-time initialization:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template FunTemplate(string op)\n{\n  shared static this()\n  {\n    import std.stdio;\n    writeln(op);\n  }\n}\n\n// Use like this\nmixin FunTemplate!&quot;Hello from DLang&quot;;</pre>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s say we want to refactor the library in some way that it&#8217;s desirable to distinguish the name <code>FunTemplate</code> and its implementation. How would you go about doing that?</p>\n<p>One way would be to tack <code>Impl</code> onto the implementation name, then declare an eponymous template that aliases the shortened name to the implementation name and forwards the template argument like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template FunTemplate(string op)\n{\n  alias FunTemplate = FunTemplateImpl!op;\n}</pre>\n<p>This does the job, but it also creates an additional instantiation for each different value of <code>op</code>, one instance of <code>FunTemplate</code>, and one of <code>FunTemplateImpl</code>. So if we instantiate it with, e.g., five different values, we end up with ten unique instantiations. Now imagine doing that with a template that&#8217;s heavily used throughout a program.</p>\n<p>Since we only want to provide an alternate name for the implementation and aren&#8217;t doing anything to the parameter list, we can achieve the same result without adding another template into the mix: just use <code>alias</code> by itself.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">alias FunTemplate = FunTemplateImpl; </pre>\n<p>Since <code>FunTemplate</code> is no longer a template, <code>FunTemplate!&quot;Foo&quot;</code> only creates the one instance of <code>FunTemplateImpl</code>.</p>\n<h2 id="normalizationoftemplatearguments">Normalization of template arguments</h2>\n<p>Once we know what we want a template to look like, and we&#8217;re satisfied with the interface we want it to have, there are sometimes subtle ways to separate the interface and implementation of a template such that we can minimize the total amount of work the compiler has to do.</p>\n<p>The definition of &#8220;work&#8221; in this context can be important to consider, as we can find ways to balance a tradeoff between compile times and the amount of object code generated for each instantiation. One technique to reduce these costs is by normalizing a given list of template arguments into something called a <em>canonical form</em>.</p>\n<h3 id="canonicalforms">Canonical Forms</h3>\n<p>A canonical form, resulting from a process called canonicalization, is a mathematical structure that is intended to reduce multiple different-looking but identical objects into <em>one</em> form that we can then manipulate as we see fit. Using an automatic code formatter is an example of transforming input (in this case, source code) into a canonical form.</p>\n<h3 id="applicationtotemplates">Application to templates</h3>\n<p>Consider a template like this one:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template Expensive(Args...)\n{\n  /* Some kind of expensive metaprogramming or code generation */\n}</pre>\n<p>If we can think of a useful canonical form that isn&#8217;t too hard to compute, we can then write a second template <code>Reduce</code> to implement it, then inject it like in the following example.</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">template Expensive(Args...)\n{\n  // Reduce to some kind of canonical form\n  alias reduced = Reduce!(Args);\n\n  // Where ExpensiveImpl is the same as above but renamed\n  alias Expensive = ExpensiveImpl!(reduced);\n}</pre>\n<p>To be worth doing, <code>ExpensiveImpl</code> must be <em>significantly</em> more expensive than the reduction operation (pay attention to differences in <code>sys</code> time when measuring this), where &#8220;significant&#8221; is meant statistically rather than informally, i.e., any win is good as long as you can rigorously prove it&#8217;s real.</p>\n<h3 id="anexample:sortingtemplatearguments">An example: sorting template arguments</h3>\n<p>Take a templated aggregate like this:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">struct ExposeMethods(Types...)\n{\n  /* Some kind of internal state dependant on Types but not their order */\n\n  static foreach(Type; Types) {\n    bool test(Type x) { \n      /* Something slow to compile depending on Type */\n    }\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>If it&#8217;s instantiated with, e.g., five different types across a large codebase, we could spend a lot of time redoing semantically identical compilation. If all possible types are used as input many times, we could end up with a few permutations, and if not we will probably get a few identical subsets.</p>\n<p>A canonical form that might come to mind (i.e., a potential definition of <code>Reduce</code>) is simply sorting the arguments by their names. This can be achieved <a href="https://dlang.org/library/std/meta/static_sort.html">via the use of <code>staticSort</code></a>.</p>\n<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>D has powerful metaprogramming and code generation features. But like anything in programming, their use isn&#8217;t free. If you want to avoid the situation where you find yourself making coffee while your project builds, then it&#8217;s imperative to be aware of the cost vs. benefits of the metaprogramming features you use. Then you can make intelligent decisions about your compile-time interfaces and implementations.</p>\n<h2 id="appendix-tracingthedcompilertocounttemplateinstantiations">Appendix &#8211; Tracing the D compiler to count template instantiations</h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a simple lesson in Linux userspace tracing: you can use a tool like <code>bpftrace</code> or <code>DTrace</code> to spy on the D compiler compiling other things, so we can get basic figures about the compilation of other D programs without either hacking the compiler or changing their build process.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need a <code>bpftrace</code> file like the following (saved as e.g., <code>main.bt</code>):</p>\n<pre>BEGIN\n{\n  printf("Tracing a D file\\n");\n}\nuprobe:/home/mhh/dlang/dmd-2.097.0/linux/bin64/dmd:_Dmain\n{\n  printf("This is the main\\n");\n}\nuprobe:/home/mhh/dlang/dmd-2.097.0/linux/bin64/dmd:_D3dmd10dsymbolsem24templateInstanceSemanticFCQBs9dtemplate16TemplateInstancePSQCz6dscope5ScopePSQDr4root5array__T5ArrayTCQEq10expression10ExpressionZQBkZv\n{\n  //We do nothing with the knowledge here but if you write some code you can get info about the templates relatively easily\n  printf("Instantiating a template\\n");\n}</pre>\n<p>What am I hooking here? That big mangled name in the middle of the script is <code>templateInstanceSemantic</code> in the <code>dsymbolsem</code> module in the DMD source. By hooking it, we can get a rough idea of when a template is being worked on.</p>\n<p>Running it with <code>sudo bpftrace main.bt</code> (eBPF tracing currently requires root) when building DMD, for example, I see there are about 50,800 template hits.</p>\n<p>You can use a more complicated script in a system like <code>bcc</code> to reconstruct the compiler&#8217;s internal data structures. With that, we can get output a bit more like <code>09:05:17 69310 b\'/home/mhh/d_dev/dmd/src/dmd/errors.d:85\'</code> and actually reconstruct the source/line info (alongside a timestamp and PID).</p>'}]}

It&#8217;s a full-term course with lectures, practical lessons, and exams, although it&#8217;s all remote now. This is the story about how I got there, the challenges I encountered, and how students sometimes surpass their teachers.</p>\n<h2 id="whatsindforuniversitystudents">What&#8217;s in D for university students</h2>\n<p>The job market for D is very small. As I always say during the first lesson, it&#8217;s unlikely that students are going to write D code for a salary, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that learning D is useless. Firstly, it&#8217;s much easier to learn how to program with D than with C or C++. This is important because many students don&#8217;t know how to program even after a full C/C++ course. Secondly, a broader outlook makes for better code. My familiarity with D improved my C++ skills and made it much easier to learn Python, especially its iterators. Most importantly, D is the future&mdash;of C++ and beyond. Many C++11/17/20 novelties were first battle-tested in D, and even today D is a much more modern and feature-rich language than C++.</p>\n<h2 id="whoamiandwhatsindforme">Who am I and what&#8217;s in D for me</h2>\n<p>For simplicity, I would say that I am a C++ programmer. This is my main line of work. Before this course, I&#8217;d never been a teacher of any sort. Even on my job, I&#8217;m not involved much in mentoring. After earning my master&#8217;s degree in Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics at UNN (Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod) in 2014, I had no relation to academics at all.</p>\n<p>In my first months of university, I entertained the thought of being a school teacher. Now I realize that this was just a call for justice of sorts. There is a stark difference between a high school and a university, and for me, the latter was a much better experience. It felt like in just one month at university I learned more than in one term in high school, and that was so cool. <em>Why couldn&#8217;t they explain it <strong>this way</strong> back in high school</em>, was my common thought. If only educators applied the same educational methods in a regular school, it would make the experience much better. My desire to become a teacher vanished the second I received my first paycheck as a programmer (in Russia, &#8216;programmer&#8217; is a very well-paid job and &#8216;school teacher&#8217; is the total opposite), but some memory of that desire remained.</p>\n<p>This was also the time when I became interested in D. Compared to C++ it looked like a perfect programming language. You can write code that would be as fast, but without all those C atavisms. I used D for my master&#8217;s thesis, and I loved it. My program was twice as small and simple as the older C++ version while performing better. Implementing complex and more efficient algorithms in D was much easier; doing the same in C++ would be too much work, and, like any student, I always struggled with my deadlines.</p>\n<p>Since then I&#8217;ve followed D and used it for my little pet projects. I&#8217;ve always wanted to help the D community in some way, but I couldn&#8217;t write any useful library, nor could I find the motivation for contributing to open source.</p>\n<h2 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h2>\n<p>In 2018, an unusual offer surfaced on the D mailing list: does anyone by any chance want to teach students in Moscow, Russia?</p>\n<p>The initiator was Dmitry Olshansky, a well-known member of the D community, the creator of <code>std.regex</code> and more. I contacted him and said I was interested. I didn&#8217;t see myself as a full-fledged lecturer and expected to be just an assistant. At the beginning that was the plan, with someone else acting as a lecturer. He was going to give lectures remotely via Skype, and I would assist him on site.</p>\n<p>To my surprise, the university in question was RSUH, Russian State University for the <em>Humanities</em>. As it turned out, they do have technical faculty there, and the students do actually code. I checked their program: D was introduced for third-term students, and during the first two terms they learned C, C++, Prolog, and even some Lisp, I think (a bit too much, but why not). Their math course was solid, too (yes, I am among those who think that math is important for programmers).</p>\n<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>\n<p>I was introduced to the department staff. They explained everyone&#8217;s responsibilities and even offered the opportunity to join in scientific work as a programmer. We started working on the course program, although I barely included myself in that “we”. That was a mistake. With one month left until the classes started, the lecturer was suddenly leaving us. The news took me by surprise, but&#8230; there was still plenty of time, right?</p>\n<p>This was happening when it was time for me to complete all the formalities and start work. Though I knew they were hiring only me, for some reason I was still under the impression that I wouldn&#8217;t be alone. I can&#8217;t say why I thought so. Everything was saying that there would be no help and that I had to do the whole course by myself, but my impression was hard to shake. The grave realization only came one week before Day One. Only then did I start to prepare for real.</p>\n<h2 id="bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</h2>\n<p>This is supposed to be the part about the trials and tribulations of the endless bureaucracy awaiting a poor programmer&#8217;s soul. The amount of paperwork required to sign the contract was indeed an entertaining story to tell to my peers. And everyone was, as they say, “rolling on the floor laughing” when I described applying for a Mir payroll card (Mir is the Russian national payment system mandated in the state-funded sector). But that&#8217;s it, actually.</p>\n<p>The next bureaucratic task was composing the formal program, an official paper including the course program and the materials. There were indeed a lot of formalities there, but I got some help: they showed me the paper for a very similar course. At the end of the day, it was easier than I expected. For this, I should thank the university staff. It was a one-year contract. Renewing it every year only takes one piece of paper and a couple of pen strokes.</p>\n<h2 id="thefirstclass">The first class</h2>\n<p>The schedule was set up such that my first class happened to be a seminar (a.k.a. a practical lesson) instead of a lecture. This is only on paper, though with only one group consisting of just 14 people it didn&#8217;t make any difference. The schedule was adjusted later. I got two classes in a row and could decide which was a lecture and which was a seminar. I came up with the following arrangement: in the first class, I would lecture and answer general questions, and in the second, the students would program and ask practical questions.</p>\n<p>For the first lesson, I prepared a brief description of the language, a syntax overview, a compiler, and several problems to solve: calculating the area of a triangle, solving a quadratic equation, and similar problems that yield a simple output for simple input. The idea was to immerse students in the language and immediately give them something to do with it. The plan was a success. By the end of the class, most of the students had gotten the hang of using a command-line compiler, written some code in a text editor, and solved some problems.</p>\n<h2 id="notepadandthecommandline">Notepad and the command line</h2>\n<p>I bet many people would take issue with the command line and text editor part. Seriously? No IDE? IDEs for D exist, but I left it up to the students if they wanted to use them. The reason was my own experience in learning C++ and programming in general. Knowing how a compiler works and how to link several files into a project is integral to understanding the language as a whole.</p>\n<p>This is especially true for C and C++. Things like the difference between declaration and definition lose their meaning without understanding the build process. In D, such nuances are fewer. For example, header files are not required. Still, I meant to teach how to program in D, not how to use an IDE. Things like the principles of <code>import</code> are easier to grok when using a command-line compiler rather than some “intuitive interface”. And you learn the syntax faster if you write the code by hand without autocomplete doing it for you.</p>\n<h2 id="furtherdevelopment">Further development</h2>\n<p>Lifted by the success of the first seminar, I was slammed to the ground by the first lecture. It contained the full theoretical explanation of type systems and their various types, compared D with other languages, brought out the problems of C and C++, and demonstrated what makes D different. It was a total failure.</p>\n<p>I expected the lecture to take the whole 80-minute class, including questions, but it finished in less than an hour without a single question during or after the speech. I even asked if the students couldn&#8217;t hear or understand me, or if there was a problem with my diction. But the problem was with the lecture itself. First, it was too much for one class. Second, the lecture was based on the talks I did for my job that were intended for seasoned programmers. I realized that everything that I&#8217;d prepared for my future lectures must be tossed aside and rewritten from scratch.</p>\n<h2 id="thenewprogram">The new program</h2>\n<p>The first candidate for simplification, and by that I mean expunging, was metaprogramming. Getting rid of templates was impossible since even the most basic language features and algorithms are tied to them, but code generation of all sorts was the first to be removed. Following that was anything that required external libraries. What was left were things that D code can&#8217;t be written without.</p>\n<p>Since I had better success with live communication during actual programming, I decided to focus on that. Rewriting the course on the fly was tricky, but I came up with a solid plan: throughout the semester we would write a complex calculating program, during lectures we would study language features required for a given task, and then during seminars the ideas would be transformed into code.</p>\n<h2 id="thesemesterassignment">The semester assignment</h2>\n<p>If you’re a nerd like me, you’ve probably heard of <a href="https://youtu.be/-ruC5A9EzzE">the 10,958 problem</a>. The gist of it is that you need to put signs and parentheses between numbers composed of the digits 1 to 9 so that the result would be exactly 10,958. The solution exists for any number up to 11,000, except 10,958. There&#8217;s no proof that it doesn&#8217;t exist either, hence the 10,958 problem.</p>\n<p>I gave the students an assignment to write a program that would find the solution, brute-forcing any possible combination of signs and parenthesis. All calculations were done with <code>double</code> instead of some sort of <code>bignum</code>, so it&#8217;s not a real solution, but it&#8217;s simpler this way.</p>\n<p>I had several reasons to think that this was a well-fitting problem. First, I could write a solution I expected to see from the students in five hours or two evenings. Compensating for the students&#8217; level, it looked like a good project for a semester-long assignment. Second, the solution isn&#8217;t too straightforward. Simple brute force would take too much time so you need to cut off the equal variants in the beginning. And third, I was fascinated by this problem myself, so I thought the students would feel the same. I couldn&#8217;t be more wrong.</p>\n<p>Not only were a majority of students not into such mathematics, most of them couldn&#8217;t even grasp what the problem was about and what this 10,958 was for. I failed to get them interested.</p>\n<p>When I realized the problem, it was too late to change anything. So the first semester wasn&#8217;t very engaging. Only a few students could finish the assignment to its fullest. For the rest, it was impossible.</p>\n<h2 id="thesecondsemester">The second semester</h2>\n<p>Since it was a full-term course, I had time to make up for it. For the second semester, I tried to come up with something practical and interactive. I gave the students an assignment to write a game. They were learning networking, so it was to be a multiplayer game. I recalled playing “tic-tac-toe on an infinite field” with my peers during boring lectures. The smarter name for this game is Gomoku. Two players can play online, and the game logic is simple. I was hoping to spark students&#8217; interest. This assignment turned out much better than the previous one, but I still can&#8217;t call it a full success.</p>\n<p>I really wanted to show them how coroutines (fibers, as they are called in D) make async programming much more manageable, how nice <a href="https://vibed.org/">the vibe.d framework</a> is, and how easy it is to use external libraries with <a href="https://code.dlang.org/">the dub package manager</a>. Lesson One: don&#8217;t try to sell coroutines to those who don&#8217;t know what callback hell is. Lesson Two: always keep hardware limitations in mind.</p>\n<h2 id="problemsoutofnowhere">Problems out of nowhere</h2>\n<p>I would never have thought that single-threaded compilation could be thwarted by the memory limit. It happened because the computers at the university were equipped with only 2 GB of memory, and some students&#8217; netbooks worked on a mere 1 GB. Simple programs build just fine even on weak machines&mdash;D is much better than C++ in terms of compilation time&mdash;but a large framework like vibe.d requires a lot of memory for its compilation. Now imagine, I was just telling them how everything is so easy-peasy and then half the students couldn&#8217;t even compile a networked version of Hello World.</p>\n<p>In my defense, I checked everything in advance. I set up a virtual machine with 2 GB of memory and made sure that it worked with the special compiler flags. Theoretically, I was prepared. But dealing with a new library <em>and</em> a new build system <em>and</em> new compiler flags all at once was just too much for the students. Their brains were getting DoS’d and shut down. So even though I demonstrated how to compile a program on a low-memory machine, I still had to explain to them individually why the usual method of compilation wasn&#8217;t working. For those who had only 1 GB of memory, I didn&#8217;t even have a ready solution.</p>\n<p>But still, the results of the second semester were much better: absolutely everyone could write the client side of the game. Some had problems with coroutines on the server side, but in general, they got this part just fine. For me, that wasn&#8217;t enough. So I gave them a supertask: write a simple AI for the game. This would help them understand the advantages of the client-server architecture. They had to realize that an AI is just another client, so the server code should be left as it is, and on the client side, the only required modification was move polling. This was a good problem on architecture design, suitable for students who already had gotten a grip on programming.</p>\n<p>We also had a little contest. I invited the students to play some code golf, solving a simple problem with the smallest program possible. For encouragement, I promised to free the best-achieving students from writing a semester report. And if anyone could beat my solution, they would pass the semester examination automatically (in Russian universities, teachers are allowed to set arbitrary conditions, like participating in side projects, for passing the semester without the usual examination).</p>\n<p>As I expected, nobody could beat me, though a couple of students came up with some interesting tricks, like writing <code>10</code> instead of <code>"\\0"</code> to save two symbols. Some would say this is an abuse of the type system, but clever hacks like this speak to a student&#8217;s knowledge.</p>\n<h2 id="theresultsofthefirstyear">The results of the first year</h2>\n<p>I was asking too much for a single semester; only one student could write an AI that kind of worked (she said that the first time it made a sensible move, it made her really happy). Another student who complained the whole year that programming was not her thing and that she couldn&#8217;t understand anything managed to write her own client and server. At the end of the day, all was not for nothing.</p>\n<h2 id="thesecondtry">The second try</h2>\n<p>Everything described until this point happened during the 2018/2019 academic year. The higher-ups had no issues with the course, and I was able to continue on the following year. New students, new possibilities, a new program. This time I was much better prepared. I had materials for most of the lectures, no more need to redo everything on the fly, and during the summer I had time to fix the problems with the course.</p>\n<p>The 10,958 problem was expelled on the charge of being boring. Instead, the Gomoku game was expanded, now lasting <em>almost</em> the whole term. &#8220;Almost&#8221; because the first assignment was a problem regarding OOP: students had to implement various geometrical shapes as classes and draw them on screen with some customization. I made this the first step after Hello World so everyone could learn how to use the tools, and so I could judge their level.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that students are very different. Some are already working as programmers and attend the course out of curiosity, while some still struggle with variables and loops. From the beginning, I decided that my course would be not just for everyone, but for those who are interested. However, disregarding the others would be wrong, so we needed assignments for different levels.</p>\n<p>To jump-start the network study, I set up a server with the reference implementation, and everyone could connect to it and play. Even telnet would do. Allotting more time for an assignment and providing better explanations served students well. Many could finish the supertask. We even had a little contest between AIs. A human could still beat them with ease, but it was still a big improvement over the previous year.</p>\n<h2 id="apleasantsurprise">A pleasant surprise</h2>\n<p>I had the same code golf contest again. And again, I promised to give a free pass to whoever could beat me. I&#8217;m sure you can see where this is going, but first I must explain the problem in detail. The task was to implement a function, <code>challenge</code>, defined as follows:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">import std;\n\n/**\n* Params:\n* s = Multiline string, each line containing positive integers separated by whitespace.\n* Returns: An array containing the sums of each line and the grand total as the last element.\n*/\nuint[] challenge(string s);\n\nunittest {\n    assert(challenge("0") == [0, 0]);\n    assert(challenge("1\\n1") == [1, 1, 2]);\n    assert(challenge("2\\n2\\n3") == [2, 2, 3, 7]);\n    assert(challenge("2\\n2 0 3\\n3 1 1 4") == [2, 5, 9, 16]);\n}</pre>\n<p>Only the symbols inside the function body count. Using any Phobos functionality is allowed, but no renamed imports.</p>\n<p>My solution from the previous year was pretty straightforward:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto r=s.split(\'\\n\').map!(a=&gt;a.split.map!(i=&gt;i.to!uint).sum); return r.array~r.sum; // 84 characters</pre>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t show them my solution, I just told them its character count. I was absolutely sure that, just like the previous year, nobody could beat it. Imagine my shock when I was outdone in a mere week:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto r=split(src,&quot;\\n&quot;).map!&quot;sum(map!(to!uint)(a.split))&quot;.array;return r~[sum(r)]; // 82 characters</pre>\n<p>Even with the unneeded brackets, this solution was better, thanks to the shortened <code>map</code> syntax: passing a lambda as a string in the first case and passing <code>to</code> directly in the second. The latter was just my oversight, but the former was a typical teacher&#8217;s mistake. You see, back when I first wrote my solution, it wasn&#8217;t possible to pass a string to <code>map</code> like that. I don&#8217;t remember well what the problem was, something about scopes. I missed that it was fixed at some point. That&#8217;s how in just one year you become an old geezer teacher who can&#8217;t keep up with the times.</p>\n<p>I stayed true to my word and granted a free pass to the resourceful student at the end of the semester. I was concerned that securing the pass in the middle of the semester would demotivate him to attend classes, but fortunately, I was wrong.</p>\n<h2 id="covid-19strikes">COVID-19 strikes</h2>\n<p>Of course, I can&#8217;t omit how the pandemic impacted the educational system. In the spring of 2020, all classes were moved online. There are some pros and cons to this.</p>\n<p>Giving lectures remotely turned out to be very convenient. You can mutually agree on a suitable time, and you don&#8217;t need to find a free lecture room. Another very good thing is that students can either ask questions vocally&mdash;as when they raise their hands offline&mdash;or write them in the chat so that the teacher can answer them when it&#8217;s most appropriate. I really think that this system works very well.</p>\n<p>Practical lessons are problematic though, especially with those students who aren&#8217;t involved enough. When they sit in a classroom they at least do something. Why show up at all if you&#8217;re not going to do anything? When it&#8217;s online, they just skip class. The chemistry of a group coding session with a teacher ready to help won&#8217;t kick in. I encouraged them to ask questions not only during class but at any time, hoping that this would allow me to assist them whenever they are coding. But this only worked for a couple of people.</p>\n<h2 id="lessonsofthesecondyear">Lessons of the second year</h2>\n<p>The second year was better than the first but still less than ideal. I saw no need to modify the course, but its presentation had to be addressed.</p>\n<p>We need to tear down this wall in communication. Mutual trust between the teacher and the student makes for a better educational process. It&#8217;s difficult to work with those who are wary of the teacher even when doing alright. I don&#8217;t yet know a robust solution; each case is tackled individually.</p>\n<p>Even those who are doing well need some control. I used to think that attendance scrutiny is for those students who don&#8217;t really want to learn, to intimidate them to show up. When I was a student, the best teachers never bothered about absentees. So I too was liberal with these things, even when half the group was missing. But everything has its limits. Bad students will skip classes anyway, but lazy B-graders could benefit from a little scolding.</p>\n<h2 id="fastforwardtothepresent">Fast forward to the present</h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have much to say about the last year-and-a-half. Teaching D is now part of my life. Due to the pandemic, we&#8217;ve had to move online completely. I couldn&#8217;t even meet my students face-to-face. Aside from what I said earlier about how this affects the educational process, this also disrupted one of the ideas I had.</p>\n<p>I need some way to track students&#8217; progress to be sure that they actually follow the course and don&#8217;t just show up for classes. The way I handled this during the previous two years worked for some students: if they had a problem, they asked questions during a lecture or a practical lesson. But some students just keep quiet when they have problems, so I need some means to identify them. I couldn&#8217;t do written tests for programming; that would be nonsense. So during the summer break, I came up with the idea of doing some small quizzes if COVID restrictions were to be lifted. These quizzes would affect the final grade, but not much, as the intention behind them was to help students who are having problems, not to be the final straw that breaks the camel&#8217;s back. Unfortunately, remote lessons made this nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>My students keep surprising me, coming up with newer and better solutions to the code golf puzzle. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have the exact code of the student who won in the third year (it appears that she deleted her Github account), but it was something like:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">auto r=s.split(\'\\n\').map!(a=&gt;a.split.to!(uint[]).sum); return r.array~r.sum; // 74 characters </pre>\n<p>Again, it was a feature I didn&#8217;t know about: <code>to</code> converts between arrays, too.</p>\n<p>I thought that this problem was done and that there was no room for further improvement. Oh, how wrong I was. This is what they&#8217;ve brought me this year:</p>\n<pre class="prettyprint lang-d">return(s.split(\'\\n\')~s).map!(a=&gt;a.split.to!(uint[]).sum).array; // 63 characters</pre>\n<p>This completely destroys my solution with all the improvements! Note that the trick is not in the syntax, but in the logic. This works by concatenating the split lines with the original string, making it unnecessary to declare an intermediate array, which allows implementing this function as a single statement. I would never have thought to do that! Algorithms win over micro-optimizations, even in code golf.</p>\n<p>The biggest change this year is a new, formalized evaluation system. In the semester, students earn points for doing assignments and writing reports on them. The first and simplest assignment is worth 5 points, and the last and hardest is worth 30. The maximum number of points a student can score without participating in code golf is 100. Code golf is scored by the formula <code>110 − length</code>. The code golf winner this year got 47 points for his solution which earned him an exemption from writing any reports. We have a table listing every student&#8217;s points so everybody knows how many points they need to score. Everything is very transparent, so I don&#8217;t need to worry about not being objective when evaluating students.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://dlang.org/blog/2022/02/19/how-i-taught-the-d-programming-language-at-a-russian-university/feed/', 'slash_comments': '3'}

A PDF of an early report with the title &lsquo;Single-Block Navier-Stokes Integrator&rsquo; <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA240385">can be found here</a>. It describes the simple finite-volume formulation of the code that allows simulation of a nonreacting gas on a single, structured grid. Thirty years on, many capabilities have been added through the efforts of a number of academic staff and students. These capabilities include high-temperature thermochemical effects with reacting gases and distributed-memory parallel simulations on cluster computers. The language in which the program was written changed from C to C++, with connections to Tcl, Python and Lua.</p>\n<p>The motivation for using C++ in combination with the scripting languages was to allow many code variations and user programmability so that we could tackle any number of initially unimagined gas-dynamic processes as new PhD students arrived to do their studies. By 2010, the Eilmer3 code (as it was called by then) was sitting at about 100k lines of code and was growing. We were, and still are, mechanical engineers and students of gas-dynamics first and programmers second. C++ was a lot of trouble for us. Over the next 4 years, C++ became even more trouble for us as the Eilmer3 code grew to about 250k lines of code and many PhD students used it to do all manner of simulations for their thesis studies.</p>\n<p>Also in 2010, a couple of us (<a href="https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/docs/introduction/dev-team-and-contributors/">PAJ and RJG</a>) living in different parts of the world (Queensland, Australia and Virginia, USA) came across the D programming language and took note of Andrei Alexandrescu’s promise of stability into the future. Here was the promise of a C++ replacement that we could use to rebuild our code and remain somewhat sane. We each bought <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Books">a copy of Andrei’s book</a> and experimented with the D language to see if it really was the <em>C++-done-right</em> that we wished for. One of us still has the copy of the initial printing of Andrei’s book without his name on the front cover.</p>\n<h3 id="rebuilding-in-d">Rebuilding in D</h3>\n<p>In 2014 we got serious about using D for the next iteration of Eilmer and started porting the core gas dynamics code from C++ to D. Over the next four years, in between university teaching activities, we reimplemented much of the Eilmer3 C++ code in D and extended it. We think that this was done to good effect. <a href="https://www.scientific.net/AMM.846.54">This conference paper</a>, from late 2015, documents our effort at the initial port of the structured grid solver. (<a href="https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/pdfs/T0316-eilmer-dlang-v2.pdf">A preprint is hosted on our site</a>.) The Eilmer4 program is as fast as the earlier C++ program but is far more versatile while being implemented in fewer lines of code. It now works with unstructured as well as structured grids and has a new flexible boundary condition model, a high-temperature thermochemistry module, and in the past two years we have added the Newton-Krylov-accelerated steady-state solver that was used to do the simulation shown above. And importantly for us, with the code now being in D, we now have have many fewer <em>WTF</em> moments.</p>\n<p>If you want more details on our development of the Eilmer4 code in D, we have the <a href="https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/docs/pub-n-pres/presentations/">slides from a number of presentations</a> given to the <a href="https://mechmining.uq.edu.au/research/hypersonics">Centre for Hypersonics</a> over the past six years.</p>\n<h3 id="features-of-d-that-have-been-of-benefit-to-us-include">Features of D that have been of benefit to us include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Template programming that other Mechanical Engineers can understand (thanks Walter!). Many of our numerical routines are defined to work with <code>numbers</code> that we define as an alias to either <code>double</code> or <code>Complex!double</code> values. This has been important to us because we can use the same basic update code and get the sensitivity coefficients via finite differences in the complex direction. We think this saved us a large number of lines of code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>String mixins have replaced our use of the M4 preprocessor to generate C++ code in Eilmer3. We still have to do a bit of head-scratching while building the code with mixins, but we have retained most of our hair—something that we did not expect to do if we continued to work with C++.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Good error messages from the compiler. We often used to be overwhelmed by the C++ template error messages that could run to hundreds of lines. The D compilers have been much nicer to us and we have found the “did you mean” suggestions to be quite useful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A comprehensive standard library in combination with language features such as delegates and closures that allow us to write less code and instead concentrate on our gas dynamics calculations. I think that having to use C++ Functors was about the tipping point in our 25-year adventure with C++.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ranges and the foreach loops make our D code so much tidier than our equivalent C++ code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Low-barrier shared-memory parallelism. We do many of the flow update calculations in parallel over blocks of cells and we like to take advantage of the many cores that are available on a typical workstation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Simple and direct linkage to C libraries. We make extensive use of Lua for our configuration and do large simulations by using many processors in parallel via the OpenMPI library.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The garbage collector is wonderful, even if other people complain about it. It makes life simpler for us. For the input and output, we take the comfortable path of letting the compiler manage the memory and then tell the garbage collector to tidy up after us. Of course, we don’t want to overuse it. <span class="citation">@nogc</span> is used in the core of the code to force us not to generate garbage. We allocate much of our data storage at the start of a simulation and then pass references to parts of it into the core functions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fast compilation and good optimizing compilers. Nearly an hour’s build time was fairly common for our old C++ code, and now we would expect a DMD or LDC debug build in about a quarter of a minute. This builds a basic version of the main simulation code on a Lenovo ThinkPad with Core i7 processor. An optimized build can take a little over a minute but the benefit of the faster simulation is paid back by orders of magnitude when a simulation job is run for several hours over hundreds of processors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>version(xxxx) { ... }</code> has been a good way to have variants of the code. Some use complex numbers and others are just double numbers. Also, some variants of the code can have multiple chemical species and/or just work with a single-species nonreacting gas. This reduction in physical modelling allows us to reduce the memory required by the simulation. For big simulations of 3D flows, the required memory can be on the order of hundreds of gigabytes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>debug { ... }</code> gets used to hide IO code in <code>@nogc</code> functions. If a simulation fails, our first action is often to run the debug-flavor of the code to get more information and then, if needed, run the debug flavor of the code under the control of <code>gdb</code> to dig into the details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a very specialized application and so don’t make use of much of the software ecosystem that has built up around the D language. For a build tool, we use <code>make</code> and for an IDE, we use emacs. The D major mode is very convenient.</p>\n<p>There are lots of other features that just work together to make our programming lives a bit better. We are six years in on our adventure with the D programming language and we are still liking it.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://dlang.org/blog/2022/02/02/a-gas-dynamics-toolkit-in-d/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5'}

Mostly prompted by curiosity as to what  Benedict Jacka had got up to since finishing his <em><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/books/reviews/book-review-risen-by-benedict-jacka/">Alex Verus</a></em> series. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His new series, <em>Inheritance of Magic</em>, seems good! Good enough, anyway, that I pre-ordered the third book for Kindle and wish that I&#8217;d waited a little longer before this particular spot of curiosity struck, as there is going to be a lot of waiting to see this series unfold!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Dan Willis&#8217; <em>Arcane Casebook</em> series to fill the gap. I&#8217;m through two of the five books in the bundle I bought already, and I can tell I&#8217;ll be getting the rest. It&#8217;s a bit of an interesting spin on the genre, too, being set in &#8216;Depression era&#8217; New York, but where magic of various forms has taken the place of certain aspects of technology developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m torn on having Goodreads count it as a single book though. It&#8217;s >1,800 pages for the five books, which is not out of the question but certainly on the longer end of my typical books, but each individual book is shorter than my typical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still- I think I&#8217;ll hit my 15 book target easily enough even counting it as just the one, so eh! :)</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-september-2025/">Time to Loot Journal: September 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com">Time to Loot</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-september-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2', 'post-id': '65691'}

I&#8217;m convinced the first cave-teenager to suffer a break-up took to banging rocks together in a rhythmically satisfying way, rather than talking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could absolutely have been that cave-teenager. Finding music that resonates with the soul, or at least the big feelings of the moment, is cathartic in a way almost nothing else can be. Even if it does take a bit of mental gymnastics to make every line fit your situation sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a>. You may&#8217;ve heard of it &#8212; but if not, it&#8217;s an AI that can create songs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d heard of it before. But honestly? I had simply assumed it&#8217;d be little more than a toy. Somewhere along the line I got the idea you had to provide your own vocals, and the AI just acted like a souped-up auto-tune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>can</em> use it like that, sure. But you can also simply write your own lyrics and have it go at it. Heck &#8212; if you&#8217;d rather, you don&#8217;t even need to do that. Just describe what you want, like any other LLM, and it&#8217;ll spit out your response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only this time it comes with a soundtrack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://suno.com/s/YfVE4FBgRpdZWnZF"><em>Shadows and Neon</em></a> is one such created in this way. I could not have expended any less effort on it if I <em>tried</em>. I can&#8217;t even recall what my prompt was, but I know I didn&#8217;t even bother prompting for specific styles. I just wasn&#8217;t invested yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it made me sit up and pay attention because I couldn&#8217;t hand on heart tell you I&#8217;d definitely have identified it as AI-generated if I hadn&#8217;t just clicked the &#8216;Create&#8217; button myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thus Starts my Crash Course in Song Construction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I <em>like</em> music, I couldn&#8217;t have told you a few days ago what a &#8216;prechorus&#8217; was (beyond the obvious), or what precisely a &#8216;bridge&#8217; is meant to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of this learning was just feeding in basic prompts and seeing what came out, but I also took a bit of a stab at seeing if I knew enough to take inspiration from other, much better, songs and seeing if Suno could get me anywhere close. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was even reading song and album reviews for crying out loud. It was a bit like learning a new language adjacent to, but not quite the same as the one you&#8217;re native to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/jJSVX5qAs2KcYbK6">What Never Relents</a></em> is one such attempt, where I was looking to see if I could craft a style prompt to hit a similar feel to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUe9UhcUtEI">Specter by Bad Omens</a></em>. It does tickle me that the generated lyrics here used &#8216;Specter&#8217; without specifically being prompted to or given the lyric directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not an unqualified success (particularly not on the vocal stylings), I was, once again, somewhat impressed. And I hadn&#8217;t even realised that you could enfold section-specific direction to vocals and music in the lyrics as well yet!<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-1-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-65184" title="I mean, it will ignore you completely 9 times out of 10, but still, you can!"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Toy to Therapist</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point, a switch flicked. Don’t ask me how or why &#8212; I couldn’t tell you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I do know is that I realised I’d still been treating Suno as a toy, when it was clearly more than that. So… I did something I haven’t done in <em>many</em> years.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-2-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65184" title="Probably not since I was that rock-bashing cave-teen myself."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote something like poetry — only this time, I had a way to give it a soundtrack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we call those songs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because she’d been on my mind a lot lately, I wrote one about my mother. Let me tell you &#8212; I was <em>not</em> ready to hear the words sung back at me. Jesus H. Christ. I&#8217;m uncertain what context to give. Perhaps none, and leave it to what I&#8217;ve already <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/goodbye-mum/">said in the past</a>. Songs are meant to speak for themselves anyway, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hit me harder than I expected. Harder than I was ready for. And yet, I kept working on it. It took a fair bit of finessing of lyrics and style guides to get where I wanted it &#8212; and Suno really does not like being told what to do if you introduce the concept of a second voice &#8212; but I ultimately found my way to this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/zQ6jTxGIw1ClJRnT">The Weight of Love</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s still a sombre piece overall, the more I tweaked, the more small notes of light started slipping in. Verse 3, for example, wasn’t in the first draft at all &#8212; it only emerged as I kept writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, for starters, I think I finally get why some albums feel like they’re circling one idea over and over. Apparently, when something matters, you don’t just&#8230; wring it out in a single track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So of course I had to do another. I had more work through here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just like that, I think I&#8217;m on the path to just creating a whole (virtual) album. Whodathunk? Certainly not me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not blind to the issues such AI technologies pose, whichever side of the fence you sit on. I can&#8217;t say I know how ethically the models have been trained (but&#8230; I could guess). Nor do I relish a future where the world is drowning in &#8216;AI Slop&#8217; in the music field as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the transition of considering Suno from Toy to Therapist is perhaps telling of my perspective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to spell it out; I don’t think anything I make with it should soar to the top of the charts, or replace the work of genuinely talented artists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as something personal — a way to process, to experiment, to speak feelings I’d struggle to put into words otherwise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s powerful stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first cave-teenager banged rocks together to make sense of big feelings. I guess I’m doing the same, only now the rocks have been swapped for an algorithm and a pair of headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bonus Track</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/hjZv4nd55jkbFif0">Remember Me (That Way)</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second (made, but maybe not in final placement) track from this hypothetical album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honouring Mum&#8217;s request for how she wished to be remembered &#8212; but without burying the truth for those left behind, either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a trickier one to land, asking Suno to balance minor and major sections to hit the right overall tone. Last night I was <em>just about</em> ready to come to the conclusion Suno simply couldn&#8217;t do it. After changing my approach to the in-lyric style notes and the main style guide, here we go!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/">Accidentally, Songs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com">Time to Loot</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'post-id': '65184'}

This month taught me nothing if not that breaking a six-year streak is a little harder than I thought. Seven years, I guess, once I hit publish on this one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll save the substance of the breakdown on that and how I feel about the event (and specifically, my engagement with it) in a later post though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the posting, I still got some gaming in. I was curious enough to take a look through the data and see how it compared to other Blaugusts I&#8217;ve participated in. I had an inkling it was more than the past few at least &#8212; turns out, yep! Correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65035" height="430" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-8-940x430.png" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">And in fact, looked at in this light, I can perhaps begin to suspect that there was a whole other reason than inexperience which made the first couple of Blaugust&#8217;s feel so much harder.

While venturing into &#8216;Lessons Learned&#8217; territory again, it is in fact a lesson I learn most Blaugusts. One that fills me with good intentions for the months ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll have to see if I can do anything with it this time around, but&#8230; I have some hope just from the fact that Final Fantasy XIV has seemingly stuck the landing for me this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My desire to play did <em>not</em>, in fact, die upon the slopes of <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/gaming/im-done-with-mmos/">Mt Setupyourskillbar</a> this time around.

My interest has increased the further on I&#8217;ve gone though, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was to point out the key reason for enjoying this one less, it would be the tie-in to real-world, actual history.  I shant elaborate further as to what or when, but I will explain a little more my issue with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it isn&#8217;t the subject matter itself, nor the philosophical or ethical lean Lawrence is aiming for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m on board with all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it removed all subtlety from the proceedings. It no longer asked the reader to think through implications and parallels for themselves and instead became a mallet to the face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strength of fiction, done well, is that whole stimulation of thought. Creating (or perhaps more accurately, finding) the links for yourself. I believe it truly holds the power to change hearts and minds in a way that a raw recounting of history cannot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than that though, no-one enjoys being preached at, even when they already agree with the message. While I wouldn&#8217;t quite accuse Lawrence of that here with the third book, it started feeling like it might toe that line to begin with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all that &#8212; I&#8217;m still more than curious to see where the series ends, and it does little to dampen my enthusiasm for Lawrence as an author on the whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

Beyond that though the decision gets a fair bit trickier. Both FFXIV and Wuthering Waves are doing their darndest to be the one. Wuthering Waves had its 2.6 patch this week, with a character banner I was actually interested in<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-3-65003"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/wuthering-waves/screenshot-saturday-wuthering-waves-2-6-edition/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-65003" title="I haven&amp;#8217;t gone for anyone since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D9K2rz3Uvk&quot;&gt;Cartethyia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=optr9r9VkoQ&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;)"><sup>3</sup></a></span> and what looks to be a finale-feeling storyline for the Rinascita story arc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Although it is possible, actually, that this trailer is representing more than just 2.6.

Actually- that&#8217;s not 100% true. I have done the preamble/character introduction bits, but then paused just shy of getting started <em>properly</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead I&#8217;ve caught up on the Overture quest from 2.5, which, come to think of it, is pretty similar in nature to the between-expansion quest lines of FFXIV.

I was on a deadline, albeit a self-imposed one. I had things to do. &#8230; Thing to do. <em>Alright, geez,</em> I had a game to play. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have our own motivations, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonight I don&#8217;t have quite the same need.

So I&#8217;m going to call that progress. Surely it&#8217;s better than stopping mid-post to reply in Discord or Google some random thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I think it might be actually, is channelling that&#8230; <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/writing-comments-vs-posts/">comment writing energy</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The linked post goes into more detail, but as a brief recap if you haven&#8217;t the foggiest what I mean&#8230; Something that&#8217;s true for me, and others, and maybe you&#8217;ll recognise it as well after I explain it, is that writing a post&#8230; Man, that&#8217;s <em>work</em>. It takes time. Serious time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments though? Even if they end up being post-length in nature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Easy</em>. They just flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a whole other part of your brain gets engaged.

And if you look at it funny and kinda squint a little bit, you might stretch me to two and a quarter. Maybe even two and a half &#8212; as the missing game I <em>had</em> played before, at its PlayStation release. I just thought I might pick it up again on PC, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong> is, frankly, amazing. The gameplay trailers we saw in the four years of development often seemed as if coming directly from a game designer&#8217;s fever dream. Such doubts didn&#8217;t stop me in the slightest from feeling an unhealthy degree of hype for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-medium is-resized wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-58475" height="264" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blackmyth-Wukong-470x264.jpg" style="width: 400px;" width="470" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I knew what I was doing, and it was certainly at the back of my mind that it could <em>never</em>. But it did!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Myth: Wukong ended up being a lot less souls-like and a lot more action-like than I, and I think many others expected, borrowing only lightly from the Souls-like trappings, otherwise content to do its own thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>God of War: Ragnarok</strong> is also amazing.

None of the trailers to date have done much for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, what it was&#8230; Was playing Borderlands 3 again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All I consciously remembered of the game was the eye strain induced by rolling eyes so hard at the antagonist dialogue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually&#8230;?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all that, it was <em>fun</em>. Turns out, there <em>was</em> a reason my friends and I have played through all three Borderlands games to date, sometimes multiple times! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was with that lens some of the gameplay coming out from content creators grabbed my attention a bunch more, and here we are, considering prioritising it against even Hollow Knight: Silksong!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Battlefield 6 &#8212; 11 October</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/other-games/battlefield-6-open-beta/">The beta</a> was enough to convince my friend group that we want in.

What I didn&#8217;t appreciate until quite recently is that it isn&#8217;t just a Singleplayer game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is there co-op, but you can even (optionally) go into a full &#8216;Online&#8217; mode where it is more of an MMO-lite, with world events/bosses, and the whole nine yards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh- it&#8217;s also free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which can be boon or bane; but at least how the devs are talking now &#8212; the monetisation seems restricted to cosmetics only. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a slew of sponsored videos like this one, where there is clearly a desire to build interest in the West before the release later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is coming across as a bit of an &#8216;everything to everyone&#8217; game at the moment, which again&#8230; Could be concerning.

The winner is first to 100 points, where any regular soldier is worth just 1 point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, each side will always have one fighter marked by a beam, indicating they are worth 10.

Because I <em>thought</em> it was a simple DPS race (I was <em>very</em> close to achieving it this way), but I was underestimating the game again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a mechanic there which needed to be respected.

There is a double standard at play there. But this time, one <em>against</em> rather than for myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <em>other</em> people post short posts &#8212; it&#8217;s fine. Maybe even great.

You can find it as you go. But it is important to recognise your motivation <em>is</em> a &#8216;why&#8217;, and not a &#8216;what&#8217;. (Generally.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/staying-motivated/">Staying Motivated</a></strong> &#8212; may involve a degree of change!

Cyberpunk 2077, for all its launch faults, is in fine form now. It wasn&#8217;t abandoned or given bare minimum technical touch-ups. Instead, it had literal <em>years</em> of additional development effort put in to make it sing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bring it up in the context of a brilliant post by <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/">Frostilyte</a>, asking the question: &#8220;<a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/18/is-it-wrong-to-support-grounded-2-in-early-access/">Should <em>Grounded 2</em> even be <em>allowed</em> to utilise <em>Early Access</em>?</a>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My title probably spoils this, but: <em><strong>yes</strong></em>. Not only <em>should</em> Grounded 2 be &#8216;allowed,&#8217; I wish more big titles had the guts to wear the Early Access label when it fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyberpunk sure should have. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, gamers were left feeling anything &#8212; or everything &#8212; from frustration to disappointment, or even betrayal. Slap the EA badge on it and suddenly? The consumer transparency preserves a mountain of goodwill and space to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281" height="461" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190826000049_1-830x461.jpg" width="830" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>No Man&#8217;s Sky</em></strong>: Another example where the &#8216;Early Access&#8217; tag really should&#8217;ve been applied.

Although I would hope not a controversial one: <em>If, for whatever reason, you&#8217;re not going to finish the game before putting it out, maybe at least be honest about this fact.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Frostilyte had more than just us consumers in mind. He was interested in watching out for the Indies, and that&#8217;s where the debate perhaps gets a little more complicated. Early Access was, after all, born as an indie lifeline — a way to keep the lights on and build community while development continued. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It provided a path that maybe <em>didn&#8217;t</em> ask Indies to re-mortgage their house in trade for a year of development time in the hopes of not (literally) losing it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when AAA shows up in that space, the worry is whether it tilts the field even further against the smallest studios. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-53598" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CS2Header-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Cities: Skylines 2:</em></strong> Even now, this one should still be wearing an Early Access badge.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And from that concern, there are a couple of additional paths beyond consumer transparency that my mind goes down, but neither of them changes my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>Indies and AAA <em>already</em> co-exist; and Indies aren&#8217;t just catering to a small niche of interest any more.</strong><br />Indies and AAA&#8217;s already co-exist in the market today, having broadened from a once scrappy niche with only occasional breakouts to something with a higher degree of awareness in the gaming zeitgeist. AAA&#8217;s adopting &#8216;Early Access&#8217; doesn&#8217;t materially change things for the worse, and in fact, there is an argument to be made that says such a move would further legitimise &#8216;Early Access&#8217; and broaden the range of people willing to try it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>What even is an &#8216;Indie&#8217; anyway?</strong><br />The term covers a vast spectrum, from the solo dev mortgaging their house we mentioned, to &#8216;indie elites&#8217; like Supergiant, Team Cherry, or Larian, pulling in millions with sizable teams.

Although this thing has been in the works so long, it certainly has been placed &#8212; for the purposes of retaining sanity &#8212; in my mind into the category of &#8216;never going to turn up in my natural lifespan&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do think a shadow drop at the end of this is not out of the question, but at minimum, I expect we&#8217;ll come away with a release date to go alongside the additional gameplay teaser.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lords of the Fallen II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve only somewhat recently started playing Lords of the Fallen (2023) after their 2.0 update, when they added in co-op by way of a free &#8216;Friends Pass&#8217;, which is a neat addition I always love to see for any game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re not done with it yet, hard to say if we even will (my co-op partner is not much of a Souls-like afficiando), but the experience while not a top-notch-shining-example of the genre was good enough that I&#8217;m holding some interest in seeing where they go next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Europa Universalis V</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not given the Europa Universalis series anywhere near as much time as Crusader Kings, and in fact &#8212; EUIV is the only one I&#8217;ve touched at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is just something about the more personal relationships and stories of CK that pulls it ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so &#8212; colour me interested. Getting in at the ground floor on a Paradox game is generally a good idea if you want to have any hope of learning the game in question without reliance on extensive &#8216;let&#8217;s play&#8217; styled tutorial videos. xD</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Silent Hill <em>f</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230; <em>think</em>&#8230; I&#8217;m interested? I&#8217;ve actually never played a silent hill game before. The concept has always interested me (insofar as I understand it, at least) &#8212; just never made the jump to actually doing anything about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I watched the movie though, if that counts? xD</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, similar to EUV above &#8212; I&#8217;ll await reviews and see how it lands before deciding, but will keep it on my radar in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enshrouded &#8212; Wake of the Water Update</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick search tells me that the only prior mention of Enshrouded on Time to Loot was the <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-january-2024/">January 2024 Journal</a>. Said mention? Just a sole entry logging ~5 hours of play time, and that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll say now what I didn&#8217;t say then: I <em>loved</em> almost everything about my time with Enshrouded, even at that early point (which must&#8217;ve basically been at release).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was just one disappointing factor for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In multiplayer, the quest state is (was? I should look into this) determined by the world state. And not just for things where maybe it makes sense (e.g., rescuing an NPC) but for <em>everything</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you, as I do, prefer to have independent bases *in addition* to the more communal setup&#8211; so far as the quests are concerned anyway, too bad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is absolutely a nitpick, and even if that is unchanged, the look of this update, let alone whatever may have come up to this point, might be the point at which I let it go and jump back in regardless. It looks <em>great</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resident Evil Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My &#8216;real&#8217; introduction to Resident Evil (*cough* outside of the movies) was with what I believe to be the first of the modern entries &#8212; Resident Evil VII: Biohazard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still need to make my way through the frankly amazing-looking remakes at some point, but they may have to wait a bit longer after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Black Myth: Zhong Kui</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yes</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Myth: Wukong, somewhat amazingly, <em>actually managed to live up to the hype.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhong Kui isn&#8217;t just a DLC as earlier speculation suggested, but rather a full-on sequel. I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb and suggest there probably won&#8217;t be as long of a wait this time around, assuming a lot of technology (and perhaps even asset) re-use from Wukong.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vampire: the Masquerade -Bloodlines 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno about this one anymore. It has been through an incredible amount of development hell and studio handovers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might still come out of the oven OK, but I&#8217;d place the chances of that being <em>very</em> slight. Which is a shame, as this occupied the #1 spot on my Steam wishlist for probably a good few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess I might be listing it here now more out of morbid curiosity than anything else. It&#8217;s coming out October 22, 2025 &#8212; so I guess we&#8217;ll know soon enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

Here’s the list of games I was playing throughout September:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#ggst">Guilty Gear Strive</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#sudoku">Sudoku</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; it was a bit of a light month. That’s entirely my fault.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ggst">Guilty Gear Strive</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m sure this will come as a surprise to no one: <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> dominated my gaming time throughout September. The addition of the <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/">newly improved ranked mode</a>, and proper matchmaking made <em>Strive </em>a lot more fun to play when compared against my previous experience with the game. Turns out I’ll actually stick around for longer sessions if I’m not constantly being bombarded by messages about connection failure. Who’d a thunk it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the main draw for my time commitment throughout September was twofold: updating my <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/01/19/guilty-gear-strive-may-guide-for-beginner-combos/">May Beginners Guide</a>, and playing more Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The May guide took about 10 days of on again, off again work to actually hammer through, but I’m fairly pleased with how it turned out. In general, I think the guide does a better job of handing new players safer combo routing that they can use as a springboard for playing May.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also ended up redoing all of the videos for said guide, which meant that I could finally remove all of the background noise. I didn’t even realize it, but <em>Strive </em>plays a wind sound effect passively in the background of every stage. Normally, this extra sound is imperceptible because of the game’s music, but it’s very apparent when you have said music muted so people can’t tell how often you’re cutting between shots in an edited combo video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, those videos feel like they’re better put together now. It was definitely worth the effort even though it took me over a day’s worth of effort to capture, edit, and render 22 new videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing the May guide, my attention fell squarely on Dizzy. Originally, I’d intended to keep bouncing back and forth between her, and May. However, I had so much fun playing Dizzy that I just kept playing her, and eventually reached parity between the 2. At least, that’s true as far as my online ranking is concerned. I’m still far more comfortable using May in bracket, and am much better at putting together loose spaghetti combos with May than I am with Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Dizzy is far more fun to play now than she was before, which I was really surprised by. I wrote about it in length <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/09/27/revisiting-dizzy-at-the-end-of-strive-season-4/">here</a>, but the short version is that Dizzy has more situations where she can score a knockdown which increases her consistency. This is a stark contrast to when Dizzy first launched, and stray hits wouldn’t result in any follow through unless you had Ice Field active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I won’t profess to be an expert, I have had a lot of fun using Dizzy’s different tools to completely lock down my opponents. Nothing feels quite like keeping someone jailed at the far end of the screen while they helplessly flail around. Doubly so because smothering someone to death is non-trivial thanks to the bevy of movement options that exist. I guess Totsu was right all those months ago when he told me that I’d probably enjoy playing a zoner in <em>Strive</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I think the biggest takeaway here is that I’ve been enjoying the process of learning again. Fighting games, specifically <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, were starting to feel really stagnant for me over the past few months. Returning to <em>Strive</em>, and focusing (mostly) on a new character have helped to really reignite my passion for the genre. I think there might be something to that, but I’d prefer to explore it in detail within a dedicated post, so I’ll put a pin in that for later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sudoku">Sudoku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; I’ve continued to play <em>Sudoku</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t have a whole lot to say on this front, but I’ve gotten a lot better at solving the <em>NYT</em>, and <em>LA Times’</em> boards by sticking to Schneider notation. This involves only marking out when a number can appear in 2 different cells within a box, row, or column. The main advantage here is that you don’t clutter the entire <em>Sudoku </em>board with information that can’t be acted upon, while also providing yourself with better information to fill in additional spaces whenever you place another number.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This video probably explains it better, honestly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, as someone who typically struggles to solve boards when there are too many candidates listed across several spaces, I really like Schneider notation. It makes many of these more challenging puzzles a lot more approachable than they were when I’d get buried in the weeds of numerous different candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is an unfortunate downside of Schneider notation: it forced me to learn at a pace that I didn’t find particularly accommodating. Schneider notation is heavily reliant on the <em>Sudoku </em>player’s ability to reliably spot, and infer intersections while solving the puzzle in question. As a result, I had to get a LOT better at spotting this pattern so I could actually make use of this particular solving strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, it’s cool that I can use Schneider notation as I find it far easier to solve puzzles by using it. On the other hand, I’d have appreciated a more gradual build up to this point. Instead, I feel like I immediately rushed hard mode, which added a lot of friction to the entire learning process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, <em>Sudoku </em>is still very fun, and very satisfying. I’d highly recommend checking it out, especially if you’re looking for a way to give your brain a daily mental workout.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like so many other people, I was playing <em>Silksong </em>throughout September. What might surprise you is that I didn’t start playing it until the 20th, so I’ve not actually finished the game yet. I do think I’m over the halfway mark though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also going to skip actually introducing what <em>Silksong </em>is because I’m assuming everyone, and their dog already knows about this game. It was the source of many memes, and much speculative hype right up until it came out. This was swiftly followed by people complaining about the game being too hard, which I can&#8217;t comment on because I started playing it after the first difficulty nerf patch went live.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, <em>Silksong </em>is a game of high peaks, and low valleys for me. The areas where it meaningfully improves upon its predecessor make <em>Silksong </em>among one of my favourite games to bless the Metroidvania subgenre. However, there are a few aspects of <em>Silksong </em>that I actively question because they repeatedly interrupt the flow of exploration, and largely contribute to it feeling like a less well put together package than its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I kind of want to cover off exactly what I mean by all of that in a longer post, but I’m afraid I’ll get lost in the weeds while writing so here’s the Cliff’s notes version:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>The music by Chris Larkin is fantastic</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The wider variety of environments, and greater use of colour are a welcome change</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hornet’s movement abilities feel fantastic to use, and help to immediately distinguish her from the previous title’s hero</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enemy and boss designs (both visual, and mechanical) are great</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The newly added Crest system provides a much needed revamp to the Badge system of the previous title</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Side quests actively detract from the game, and feel like unnecessary padding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The propensity for <em>Silksong </em>to lock players into combat arenas with a deluge of common enemies is boring, predictable, and also feels like unnecessary padding</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, I’ve been having a lot of fun exploring every corner of the game, but I can’t shake the feeling that <em>Silksong </em>is collapsing under its own weight. It feels a lot more overtly video game-y, and bloated in the way that open world games do thanks to the inclusion of really nebulous side quests, and combat arenas. When I’m able to quietly explore, and untangle its labyrinthine maze of a world, I’m at my happiest. However, <em>Silksong </em>seems hellbent on ensuring that those moments are few and far between thanks to an endless deluge of unnecessary interruptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully that explains what I meant by high peaks, and low valleys.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I decided that I wanted something less action-y to play in my evenings so I started up <em>Strange Horticulture</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I say that, but I also wanted to see if I even enjoyed the game. The reason being is Mir wanted to play the sequel, <em>Strange Antiquities</em>, alongside me instead of playing it alone like she did with the first game. As such, I’ve been working my way through <em>Strange Horticulture</em> the past few evenings, so I could give an informed yay or nay to that request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who were as blissfully unaware of this game as I was, <em>Strange Horticulture</em> is a game where you run a shop by the same name, which sells strange plants. Unfortunately, none of the plants are actually labelled, so it’s your job to research, and deduce which plants are which. Ergo, this is a bit of a Detective game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, most of the puzzles haven’t been that involved, and it doesn’t seem like that’ll change either. Instead, the occult story that’s been brewing in the background is starting to take hold, so that appears like it’ll be the focus of the back half of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little disappointed by the lack of puzzles, but I am keen to see where the story goes. Hopefully <em>Strange Horticulture</em> can wrap things up in a satisfying sort of way before I completely check out due to the lack of puzzle variety, and challenge though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for whether I’ll play the sequel with my wife, I guess you’ll have to tune in next month to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, I think we’ll call it for September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, as always, for reading if you made it this far, and stay safe out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

The announcement and release of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/07/23/every-card-is-a-puzzle-in-monster-train-2/">Monster Train 2</a></em> was totally unexpected, <em>Silksong </em>&amp; <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/06/19/surface-runs-add-a-fresh-new-twist-to-hades-2/">Hades 2</a></em> both shadow dropped this month, and <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/"><em>Strive </em>received a proper ranked mode</a> 4 years after its initial release. There were also games like <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/09/02/month-in-review-duck-detective-peak-grounded-2-more/#ooo">Öoo</a></em>, <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/29/tactical-space-invaders-starvaders-review/">StarVaders</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/07/genius-deduction-the-roottrees-are-dead-review/">The Roottrees are Dead</a></em> which totally blew me away despite the limited fanfare they received in the lead up to their respective launch dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, 2025 doesn’t appear to be slowing down with the surprises because a demo for <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> dropped 2 weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who aren’t already aware, this is the next project from <em>Radical Fish Games</em>, the creators of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2018/11/21/crosscode-review/">CrossCode</a></em>. Yes &#8211; that <em>CrossCode</em>. The same <em>CrossCode </em>with gorgeous pixel art, fantastic puzzle-filled dungeons, and one of the most heartfelt narratives that I’ve ever experienced in a video game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say that I’m a little excited about <em>Radical Fish Games’</em> next project would be an understatement. Learning about, and subsequently playing the demo for <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> was akin to my experience with <em>Monster Train 2</em> earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, said demo has fanned the flames of my excitement, and now I’m very much looking forward to the <em>Early Access</em> release of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>, which is (currently) slated for the first half of 2026.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself (again).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome back to another <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/tag/demo-dive/">Demo Dive</a></em> where today we’ll be taking a look at <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>, <em>Radical Fish Games’</em> follow-up to <em>CrossCode</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, let’s start by answering the question: what is <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to <em>CrossCode</em>, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> is an Action RPG with many of the trappings of RPGs from the 16-bit era. That is to say it has the simple, but satisfying combat of something like <em>Diablo</em>, but the narrative structure and cadence of something like <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, or <em>Earthbound</em>. It’s a blending that works quite well for someone like myself who has little patience for simple turn-based combat, but otherwise doesn’t mind the winding narrative structure typical in this sort of RPG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I appreciated some of the changes that <em>Radical Fish</em> has made when compared to their previous work namely as it relates to combat. If memory serves, <em>CrossCode </em>was very button mashy in the combat department with a simple 3 hit combo, alongside a handful of special moves. By comparison, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> features a few more combo types, which players can access by inputting their attacks with a slightly different rhythm. It’s akin to how many other 2D action games have implemented their combo systems, and it makes a welcome appearance here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> features several weapon types which each have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, the sword is fast, but deals less damage than the bulky hammer making it ideal for players who want to attack more aggressively. However, the sword only deals slicing damage, which makes it totally ineffective against enemies with tough shells. That’s where the hammer will come in handy. As such, players need to adjust their approach in combat to account for the different weaknesses of what they’re fighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a really big fan of this addition as it makes combat just that little bit more involved. It’s not so overbearing as to become the focus of the game, but it does lend itself to making fights feel like an active component of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> instead of the thing you do to fill time in between everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from combat, the other aspects that <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo was keen to showcase are the return of Zelda-esque dungeons, and the narrative hook for the story. Unfortunately, you’re only allowed to explore the first dungeon up to the point where you unlock the dungeon’s key item, meaning that the majority of the interesting puzzles, and combat encounters are locked beyond the confines of the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I wouldn’t be upset about being cut off were I not having fun. What’s on offer was really enjoyable even if it was limited in scope. Besides, <em>CrossCode </em>has some of the best constructed puzzle dungeons that I’ve ever played through, so I have every confidence that <em>Radical Fish</em> will deliver in full force with this area of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final bit that I wanted to touch on with regard to <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo is the story. I won’t be speaking about the specifics &#8211; the demo is around 2 hours long, so you can play it yourself if you’re curious. Instead, I wanted to focus on how <em>Radical Fish</em> smartly uses hooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The demo begins with a brief introduction that speaks of a world ending apocalypse (named Nyx), which is swiftly followed by a tutorial section wherein you play as some of the chosen heroes meant to repel said apocalypse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things don’t quite work out though, so everything is a little out of sorts once players take control of <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> protagonist Juno.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then learn that Juno was meant to be travelling with the group of heroes we saw during the tutorial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my money, this setup was perfect. It immediately introduced the game world, set up 2 different sources of conflict, and left me with questions that I’m interested in pursuing the answers to. For example, why wasn’t Juno with the party of chosen heroes? That immediately introduces some intrigue, while also setting up a source of conflict to build the story around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might sound like I’m praising <em>Radical Fish</em> for doing the bare minimum, but you’d be surprised just how many games get this wrong. Basically any author worth their salt knows this sort of introduction is an easy way to draw the reader into your story. It gives them something to latch onto so they can cruise through the remaining character introductions throughout the opening act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, writing is rarely the focal point for many games. As such, games are usually a lot more reliant on visual set pieces, or mechanical complexity for drawing players in. It’s for this reason that I found <em>Radical Fish’s</em> use of narrative hooks so refreshing. Doubly so since it communicated to me that they’re looking to make the story of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> as much of a focal point as it was in <em>CrossCode</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, I’m typically a much more mechanically minded player &#8211; I think even a cursory glance at my other written work will reveal as much &#8211; so <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> getting its narrative hooks into me has gotta count for something, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I close out here, there are 2 other things that I wanted to (briefly) mention: the artwork, and music. I already thought <em>Radical Fish’s</em> previous work looked great, but the pixel art, and character animation are even more well done here. It’s almost unbelievable how good the game looks. Kudos to the art team!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along those same lines, I thought all of the music within <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo was great. Every track fit the accompanying locale, cutscene, or set piece to a tee which did a lot of heavy lifting for setting the appropriate tone throughout the demo. Again, big kudos to the folks responsible for the music as you absolutely nailed the assignment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that I think I’ve covered everything that I wanted to say about <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>. Obviously, I’m coming at it from the lens of someone who both played, and really enjoyed <em>CrossCode</em>, which might not be true for all of you. I feel like the demo showed that <em>Radical Fish</em> are doubling down on what made <em>CrossCode </em>so great, and I’m very eager to get my hands on the full release whenever they finish cooking it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I’ll have to wait a fair bit as <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> is planned for an <em>Early Access</em> launch in the first half of 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, if you’d like to check out the demo for yourself &#8211; and I think you should as it’s fantastic &#8211; then you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3110760/Alabaster_Dawn/">here via <em>Steam</em></a>.

My general takeaways were mostly negative even though I found her really fun to play. There were a lot of small reasons for that, but the biggest unifying theme of my complaints was that her design felt muddled. Her tools seemed built with zoning in mind, but she was fairly mediocre at keep-out. She wasn’t much better at traditional strike-throw offense either, which left Dizzy in this weird limbo state where she couldn’t do anything particularly well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t the only person who came to this conclusion about Dizzy either. Over the next several weeks, countless tier lists were published by different notable players, and every single one of them put Dizzy in the bottom tier. Heck, some even said she was the worst character in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this isn’t the first time that people have claimed a newly released character was the worst in <em>Strive</em>, so it’s important to take such claims with a grain of salt. Infamously, some said that Happy Chaos was trash when he was first released. In the following months, Happy Chaos crept to the top of most player’s tier lists, and also won <em>EVO </em>2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, in fairness, that <em>EVO </em>win came after Happy Chaos received totally unnecessary buffs to the majority of his attacking moves. This was done as a way to compensate for a nerf to the character’s zoning capabilities, but many considered this change a massive net positive for the Happy Chaos playerbase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the point remains that many people had grossly underestimated the strength of Happy Chaos upon his initial release. As such, it wasn’t unreasonable to think that myself, and others might have missed the mark with Dizzy too. Perhaps there was something we’d missed that would unlock the true potential of the character.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as weeks turned into months, people continued to nod their head in agreement about Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, this was extremely vindicating. I don’t always have the most confidence in my opinions as it relates to Fighting games, so it was nice to see a bunch of other players (at various levels of play) all coming to the same conclusion that I did with my initial assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this also kind of sucked because I really enjoyed playing Dizzy (when she worked). That sort of sentiment shouldn’t ever stop you from playing a character that you enjoy, but it’s hard to maintain a consistent level of enthusiasm when you’re reminded how much easier it’d be to just play somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there were 2 major balance patches to <em>Strive </em>between when I last played Dizzy and now. Surely, <em>Arc System Works</em> buffed her to a point where she can actually compete, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>…Right?</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Guilty Gear Strives version 1.43 patch notes for Dizzy where she was nerfed just as much as she was buffed." class="wp-image-9603" height="508" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dizzy-patch-notes-v-143.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Guys?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All joking aside, here’s the list of (relevant) changes that Dizzy received across those 2 patches:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>For Roasting Chestnuts (236K)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>First hit no longer counts as a projectile &amp; hitbox size increased</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Causes a knockdown on hit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can now neutralize other projectiles</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Far Slash (f.S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Increased hitbox</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crouching Slash (2S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Increased hitbox</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Michael Sword (214S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Causes a knockdown on hit</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I Used This to Catch Fish (236S|H)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>More than doubled the active frames of the attack</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frozen State\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>No longer (erroneously) triggers a wall break</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a change that buffed the power of Yellow Roman Cancel, and damage was nerfed across the board. Both of these changes were huge for Dizzy since it increased her defensive utility, and brought her damage output inline with the rest of the cast. In fact, you could reasonably argue that Dizzy was one of the biggest beneficiaries of both changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, after a few more weeks of playing Dizzy, what do I think of her now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a short video that I believe accurately captures my impressions:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This character is a lot better at zoning now. Her tools actually compliment one another thanks to the additional knockdown opportunities afforded by both versions of Michael Sword, and Chestnut. In all cases, Dizzy has the option to set up additional projectiles, Wings of Light, or Ice Field which allows her to run her gameplan a lot more consistently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, she has stronger tools (namely For Roasting Chestnuts) for challenging the other cast members when she gets into a zoning war. This means that she doesn’t feel completely defenseless like she used to when she had to rely solely on I Used This to Catch Fish, which was too slow to meaningfully challenge most of the cast with any degree of consistency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the massive buff to I Used This to Catch Fish is certainly the highlight of the current patch, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find the changes to Chestnut from the previous patch to be more impactful. It’s actually wild how much mileage I can get out of this special attack now. It helps to keep folks locked down, and the added knockdown makes it very easy to consistently place Ice Field. This is notable as the added icy terrain makes it much harder for opponents to approach Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I can’t overlook the changes to I Used This to Catch Fish. The almost <em>40 frames</em> that this attack is active for is insane. I’ve caught so many people off guard with this attack because it’s active for so long. I think it sits firmly in gimmick territory, but I’d be lying if I said that it wasn’t an effective gimmick. And that makes it a nice option to exercise, especially against players who’re unfamiliar with Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also loving the hitbox changes on Dizzy’s Slash normals. The extended hitbox on Far Slash has led to several instances where I’ve had it clash with an opponent’s reversal (invulnerable get-off me attacks like Shoryuken), which led to an advantageous follow-up for me. This is the sort of power I was used to wielding while playing May, and having it now on Dizzy has made her feel a lot better overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Crouching Slash is basically just May’s Crouching Slash from before it was nerfed to be 10% slower. That attack was best-in-class prior to the nerf, so Dizzy having an equally strong attack here feels so good. Plus, Crouching Slash was (it still is, honestly) my favourite way to control space with May, and it works just as well on Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All said, I think Dizzy is in a much better place now than she was when she first released. She feels like a solid middle of the pack character, with well defined strengths to accompany her many weaknesses. She has a very strong presence from everywhere on the screen, and can easily suffocate her opponent after she builds up some momentum. That said, all of her attacks have exploitable dead zones, and she still struggles to cover the space above her head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I’ve continued to have a ton of fun playing Dizzy. More so than before I’d wager. I wasn’t expecting much given how few changes she’s received over the past year, but it seems like those changes targeted the areas where Dizzy needed the most help. Now she feels like a strong zoner with unique tools, instead of direction-less generalist with meagre damage output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also felt comfortable enough to use Dizzy last week in bracket at locals, and I won all 5 games where I played her. Granted, I was still playing May for the majority of my games, but it was nice to finally show off the work I’ve been putting in with Dizzy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s hoping that I continue to have fun as I progress even further with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

That can make it hard to communicate exactly why a particular Puzzle game did or did not work for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as an example, my friends Charlie and Thomas are both very logical thinkers, and can juggle a bunch of abstract information in their minds. As a result, they find a lot of Puzzle games far too simple.

Instead, I usually get hit with, “It was neat, but a little too simple.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So…you know…that doesn’t exactly make me very confident in my abilities to recommend Puzzle games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I finished a demo for <em>The Art of Reflection</em> earlier this week, and I had to talk about it. Mostly because it is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, I’ll start Demo Dive with a brief overview of <em>The Art of Reflection</em>, though I think the attached trailer does a fairly good job of showcasing what the game is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Art of Reflection</em> is a First-Person Puzzle game with realistically simulated mirrors. Also, you can enter the mirrors. This is the foundation from which <em>The Art of Reflection</em> builds all of its puzzles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a quick example of exactly what that entails, 1 of the first puzzles that players are asked to solve in the demo involves a locked door, and a key. Unfortunately, the door requires a mirrored version of the key that you’re provided with. Luckily, you can pop through a mirror, grab a mirrored version of the key, and return to the original door which you’ll now be able to open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s notes: I only realized after the fact that this is the first puzzle in the trailer, and now feel like a doofus for using it as an example. Still &#8211; you get the idea!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a fairly basic puzzle, but that should give you an idea of what <em>The Art of Reflection</em> has going on. It’s puzzles built around reflection, and perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, I was a little dubious about how much mileage the developers <a href="https://x.com/hydrozoagames">Hydrozoa</a> could get out of that idea, but the demo did a lot to assuage my concerns. Every new room I entered either presented a completely new idea, or meaningfully built upon a previous puzzle. That gave the whole demo a great sense of momentum, and also made the whole thing very satisfying to unravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I do have to call out my favourite moment from the demo, so skip this paragraph if you don’t want to be spoiled. The first time I entered a mirror on the ceiling, and inverted gravity was so cool. I was not expecting that at all, but playing around with gravity by flipping the entire world upside down was a really neat twist on the game’s core mechanics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also got the sense that I missed a few different puzzles throughout the demo. There were these collectible pillars that you were awarded for completing several consecutive rooms. Each one seemed to increase the amount of music playing for all of the levels attached to a particular hub. I figured that the demo didn’t contain all of the levels, specifically so the developers could showcase the breadth of ideas that they had, but the message at the end of the demo makes me think that I just missed several puzzles that were hidden off the beaten path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that’s the case, that’s also really neat. I’m always a fan of Puzzle games hiding additional puzzles behind these sorts of challenges. It’s a bit of a twist on simply solving a level to unlock the next since you need to work out exactly where the hidden thing is in the first place. That’s a commitment to puzzle solving that I can appreciate in a Puzzle game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you miss those hidden levels, it’s not really a big deal? Most Puzzle games are satisfying to solve irrespective of whether or not you completed all of their most tricky conundrums. Hell, most players won’t even notice that they’ve missed anything unless you tell them. My experience is proof positive of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I think <em>The Art of Reflection</em> looks very promising. The demo has certainly wet my appetite for the full game, which releases on November 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to try <em>The Art of Reflection</em> for yourself, there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2290770/The_Art_of_Reflection/">demo currently available on Steam</a>.

I don’t know exactly what happened, but Mir’s machine died on Sunday, so fixing that became my sole focus for the day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After testing most of the components individually, I narrowed the problem down to the board, CPU, or PSU. Admittedly, I was too lazy to test the 3 of them because the PSU was out of warranty (so it was due for a replacement anyway), and you’re saddled with replacing the board and CPU simultaneously. So we set off to the local parts store thinking we needed to pick up 3 things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I forgot that we’d need a new AIO watercooler that fits an AM5 socket CPU. Also, the new boards aren’t compatible with DDR4 memory, so we were forced to upgrade that too. And Mir’s case was too small for all the new fixtures, so we rectified that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, after 9 hours of work (testing the parts, buying and delivering the new parts, deconstructing the old machine, and building the new machine) I finally had a shiny new PC built for wifey. Thankfully, it worked with very few hiccups, though it did need to have network adapters installed for a wired connection, which I thought was odd. She’s happy though, which is all that matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Mir thought it was a little unfair that she got to upgrade her machine when mine was older, so she also bought me some new parts. For context, I’ve been using a first gen Ryzen (1600X) for basically the entire lifetime of my blog. Very high-end back when I bought it in 2017, but it’s been completely obliterated by the passage of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was my Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, enough of how I was playing computer surgeon for the past 2 days &#8211; here are the highlights for August:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#duck-detective">Duck Detective 1 &amp; 2</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#grounded-2">Grounded 2</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#peak">PEAK</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#sudoku">Sudoku</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#ooo">Öoo</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="duck-detective">Duck Detective 1 &amp; 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As is true for an ever growing number of the titles I’ve written about, I first played <em>Duck Detective</em> during a <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/03/01/steam-next-fest-february-2025-indie-round-up-part-3/">Steam Next Fest</a></em>. The demo was short, but it showed enough of <em>Duck Detective</em> (for both the first, and second game) to convince me that there was something here that I’d enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As luck would have it, that demo didn’t lead me astray, and I had an excellent time playing through both <em>Duck Detective</em> games back-to-back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I didn’t play both games in a single sitting. I played them across 2 days, but I finished either game on the same day that I started it. That should give you a good idea of how much of a time commitment <em>Duck Detective</em> is. They’re the perfect sort of game for a lazy weekend afternoon, or after a mind-numbing day at the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as the games are concerned, both make a great case for blending detective work with elements of comedy. I figured <em>Duck Detective</em> would go more the route of <em>Frog Detective</em>, where the charm and humour are the focus, but both cases required a bit of deductive reasoning to work out. It wasn’t on the same level as something like <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/07/genius-deduction-the-roottrees-are-dead-review/">The Roottrees are Dead</a></em>, but I don’t think it had to be. <em>Duck Detective</em> felt like a Goldilocks level of deduction difficulty, and I appreciated that about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t just the sleuthing that made <em>Duck Detective</em> so good though: the humour also worked well. There’s a few different ways that this manifests, but my favourite was the Duck Detective himself. Sean Chiplock voices the titular detective, and gives a performance akin to a Film Noir detective who smokes a pack a day. Meanwhile, the entire game is colourful, cartoonish, and bubbly. That contrast leads to a ton of smirk worthy moments, and a few laugh-out-loud jokes throughout both games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All said, both <em>Duck Detective</em> games get a thumbs up from me. They’re great bite-sized Detective games, and I’m very much looking forward to the third installment that I assume is coming thanks to the cliffhanger ending of the second game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously. I need to know what happens next!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="grounded-2">Grounded 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/18/is-it-wrong-to-support-grounded-2-in-early-access/">Grounded 2</a></em> is the first of 2 different games that I picked up in August specifically to play with my wife. She really enjoys her Survival games, and I like doing things that make her happy. Plus, I enjoyed <em>Grounded </em>well enough, so diving into the sequel wasn’t something I was particularly opposed to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, I think the sequel is shaping up to be better than the first, but it’s obviously fairly bare-bones at the time of writing. There’s a lot of features from the first game that are missing, but planned for the sequel. That led to a number of times where the 2 of us were wondering if we’d missed something we knew existed in the original, or if it wasn’t present in the current <em>Early Access</em> build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To compensate for this, a much greater emphasis has been placed on the newly added Buggys, which are just <em>Grounded’s </em>version of mounts. Though if I’m being perfectly honest, mounts were a really good feature to launch with and build the second game around. We were basically inseparable from Sir Reginald the Domesticated (mine), and Mr Pinchy (Mir’s) once we obtained them. They make travelling so much more convenient, and their ability to carry large volumes of crafting materials was also a huge plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, the addition of mounts made me a lot less inclined to build satellite bases throughout the game world. When you can move <em>that</em> fast, you don’t really need respawn points (or emergency supplies) scattered across the map. I’m of the opinion that this somewhat undermines the survival aspects of <em>Grounded 2</em>, but it does strip out some of the tedium of creating and stocking satellite bases. As such, I don’t want to harp on about it too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also of the opinion that lowering the difficulty, at least during the first few nights, was a net positive. As veteran players, we were a little surprised by the lack of hostility, but it was easy to see how it started ramping up as we explored more of the available space, and started challenging (and defeating) stronger enemies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that, I don’t have terribly strong opinions about the rest of the changes from the first game. Most of it was either a “that’s neat”, or “I preferred this in the first game”. In either case, I wasn’t moved to the point where I feel like sharing a detailed breakdown of my nitpicks here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as recommendations go, I’d say wait for the game to receive some more updates. I think the few new additions show that <em>Eidos Montreal</em> has a good grasp on what they’re doing with <em>Grounded 2</em>, but I think the experience of actually playing through the game will be better after they’ve had more time to develop it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="peak">PEAK</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second of those 2 aforementioned games that I picked up to play with Mir. Though I’ll be perfectly honest here: I had no interest in playing <em>PEAK</em>. I know that it’s taken the whole world by storm, but I just…it didn’t look like something I’d enjoy playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those not in the know, <em>PEAK </em>is a game where you play as plane crash survivors, and need to ascend a mountain to signal for a rescue. You go through 4 different biomes, which make no logical sense, but it does provide different gameplay challenges that make the journey fairly interesting. For example, the second area, a jungle, rains constantly which makes it significantly harder to climb up the sheer cliff faces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, one night at dinner, Mir was lamenting how she was frustrated that she could never reach the eponymous peak with her regular cluster of friends. Luckily, <em>PEAK </em>was on sale that very same day, so I bought it, and said I’d help her to reach the top of the mountain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am happy to report that I have a 50% winrate at <em>PEAK</em>, and I made my wife very happy when we reached the top of the mountain during our second run playing together. I then promptly uninstalled the game because I was 100% right in my original assessment: <em>PEAK </em>is not for me. Though it was nice to help my wife, especially as I got to hear her bragging about it (over a <em>Discord </em>call) the next day with her friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hooooo boy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, <em>Is This Seat Taken</em> was another title I covered from <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/02/26/steam-next-fest-february-2025-indie-round-up-part-1/">Next Fest</a></em>, and it was one of my favourites from the particular event that it debuted at. I was really impressed with the variety of ways that developer <em>Poti Poti Games</em> managed to utilize the core mechanic of placing shapes around a level based on their seating preferences. Doubly so because of how some of your decisions would have cascading effects on future problems within the level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, there is a level in a film festival where certain movie-goers have popcorn. They’ll leave a bit of a mess behind in their seats though, which will interfere with your ability to place shapes who don’t like messy seats leading to some interesting cross-puzzle problem solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the full game doesn’t evolve much beyond the confines of what’s shown off within the demo. This was a fairly large disappointment if I’m being perfectly honest. There is so much variety in those first few levels, but you end up revisiting a lot of the same locations over, and over throughout <em>Is This Seat Taken</em> with the only real differences being that a few additional seating preferences have been added to the mix. This gives the whole game a rather flat difficulty curve, and makes it feel quite repetitive by the time credits roll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have similar opinions about the game’s story. Conceptually, I like it. Having a story about finding your place in the world gels really nicely with a game that’s literally about finding the best place for everyone to sit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the story moves at a really languid pace, and feels far too stretched out to be satisfying. I appreciated what was there, but I think the delivery would benefit from a tighter script, and delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, and it pains me to say this, I don’t know that I’d recommend <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> If it was a little tighter than I probably would, but it’s a little too drawn out for my taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sudoku">Sudoku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t originally going to include this, but I spent more time playing <em>Sudoku </em>this past month than I spent playing…anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I already wrote a whole article about it, but I’ve since progressed well beyond the point where I was while writing. I’ve completed the Hard puzzle on <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku">NYT</a> </em>for the past 2 weeks, and have done the past 14 Expert, and Impossible difficulty <em>Sudokus </em>over on <em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/games/sudoku">LA Times</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my money, the coolest part of this whole thing has been learning different solving proofs. What I mean by that is that there are certain patterns that you can apply to reduce the number of potential candidates for a specific space on the board beyond the standard <em>Sudoku </em>rules. I already touched on that a bit in my article, but I’ve had to learn several additional proofs while solving these harder puzzles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most satisfying part of this whole journey has been actually applying those proofs on future puzzles though. It’s almost like learning a new combo in a fighting game, or a new card combo in a deck-builder that improves your odds of success. Though, I’ll fully admit that I don’t always understand the internal logic for all of the proofs that I use, but I know that they work, and I can visually identify them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, I’m glad that I started doing <em>Sudoku </em>puzzles daily because they’re really satisfying to solve in a way that very few other things in my day-to-day life are. It kind of reminds me of programming if I’m being honest. Though without all the bullshit that regularly made my old office job brain-rotting instead of fulfilling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ooo">Öoo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming from the developer of <em>Elechead</em>, Nama Takahashi, <em>Öoo </em>is another great puzzle game where Takahashi takes a single idea, and runs with it to the ends of the Earth. In this case, you play as a caterpillar adjacent creature, and you place bombs that you can explode at will. The result is an incredibly satisfying puzzle-platformer that’s filled to the brim with excellent puzzles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the moment where <em>Öoo </em>went from good to great, for me, was when I hit my first dead-end. The game’s structured like a Metroidvania, so reaching that final empty room felt really anticlimactic. Everything about the game’s design language was saying that there should have been a reward here &#8211; like a new power-up &#8211; for all my effort in reaching this room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s when it hit me: I already got the power-up. In order to even reach the room in question, I had to first learn a new way to use my bombs. Then there were several consecutive rooms with puzzles built around reaffirming my understanding of this new technique. That was the reward: new knowledge that I didn’t previously possess.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That dead-end after a series of puzzles wasn’t a 1 off occurrence either: it happened another 7 times. There’s a term that I’ve heard used to describe games like this &#8211; Metroid-brainias &#8211; and <em>Öoo </em>fits squarely within that niche. All of your different “power-ups” are knowledge based, which makes them really satisfying to discover, and apply throughout the game’s world. I’m a sucker for this sort of thing, so I had a really great time working my way through each level of <em>Öoo</em>, while learning everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, I love how Takahashi wordlessly teaches all of these concepts to the player. I feel like teaching through level design has become a bit of a lost art, so seeing that on full display throughout <em>Öoo </em>was really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, <em>Öoo </em>comes highly recommended. It’s about 2 hours for a standard playthrough, and it’ll make you feel very satisfied as you work through its various quandaries. Though, I think it is limited to a <em>Steam </em>release at the moment, but I’d hazard a guess that it’ll make its way to <em>Switch </em>at some point like <em>Elechead </em>did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, I think I’ll call it for August. I was going to write a section about <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> as well, but I think the article I wrote last week <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/">gushing about the newly added Ranked Match mode</a> says it all. It’s great. It’s the best <em>Strive </em>I’ve played in a very long time. I’m happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, I don’t know exactly what I’ll be covering throughout September. There’s a few revisions I’m making to my <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/01/19/guilty-gear-strive-may-guide-for-beginner-combos/">May guide</a> in tandem with the newly dropped seasonal updates for <em>Strive</em>, but that’ll be imperceptible to most of my readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess just keep checking back here periodically, or consider subscribing for email notifications.

The game just turned 4 in June, so I assumed we’d be stuck with the Duel Tower forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the recently released <a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2559/">version 1.48</a> of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/tag/guilty-gear-strive/">Guilty Gear Strive</a></em>, a new and improved ranked system was rolled out alongside the <em>Cyberpunk Edgerunner’s</em> collaboration character Lucy. While Lucy is certainly the main draw of the new patch, the addition of Ranked Match is what coaxed me into actually reinstalling <em>Strive</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve gone <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2022/08/07/i-wish-guilty-gear-strives-ranked-play-was-better/">on record</a>, <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/05/07/im-sick-and-tired-of-guilty-gear-strives-broken-online/">twice now</a>, as being deeply disappointed in, and regularly frustrated by <em>Guilty Gear Strive’s</em> former ranked system: Duel Tower. Some of my issues have been addressed over the game’s lifetime, such as the addition of pre-match connection quality indicators, but the Tower still leaves a lot to be desired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my money, the single biggest problem with the Tower is that there is no nuance to its ranking system. There are 11 total floors, which act like 11 distinct rankings. The game takes a guess at which floor it thinks you’ll be best suited for, and then moves you up or down depending on how well you do. So far, so standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem arises when you look at how quickly the Tower will move players up, or down a floor. It only takes 5 to 6 consecutive wins, or losses for your recommended floor to change. This is fine in situations where players are demonstrably outside of the average skill level of their peers, but that’s rarely been my experience in Tower. For example, 3 back to back losses could see you get demoted a floor even if the games were fairly close. This will then see you stomping players of a lower skill level before the tower moves you back up to the floor you were on previously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth pointing out that 11 distinct rankings is fairly low. This doesn’t leave the tower with much room for more nuanced sorting simply because it only has 11 buckets to distribute players into. This also means that if the Tower is working as intended then you’re moving between groups of almost 10% of the total player population anytime you change floors. That’s a fairly absurd jump to make unless, again, the player in question is consistently outmanoeuvring all of their opponents with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking more specifically of my own experience, Tower mostly resulted in fairly 1-sided fights. I was either far better than my opponent, or I was playing someone who I had no chance of beating. My winrate might have been sitting around ~45-50% (which would be ideal), but the quality of the matches in question were subpar. Honestly, it was akin to my experience playing in open lobbies in other fighting games. Yet there was no alternative, so everyone, myself included, was forced to use the Tower regardless of how we felt about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why I was so intrigued by the addition of Ranked Matches in version 1.48. Could this finally be an answer to all of the problems I’ve previously held with <em>Strive’s</em> asinine ranking system? Will it actually allow me to regularly play players of roughly the same aptitude, instead of that being a pleasant rarity in a sea of misery?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it would happen, yes. Yes it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the best experience I’ve ever had playing <em>Strive</em>. No hyperbole. Over its lifetime, I’ve put 1000 hours into <em>Strive</em>, and this, right now, is the most pleasant experience I’ve had playing online ranked matches. The overwhelming majority of my matches have had a good cadence, and I feel like I can identify areas of improvement from losses instead of feeling totally dumbfounded. That’s a far cry from my previous experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s probably not a secret how developer <em>Arc System Works</em> managed to achieve this: they simply copied every other ranking system that exists. Instead of 11 ranks, there are now 19, which provides the ranking system with far more nuance for how it divides up players. This allows for the game to make much more accurate assessments of relative skill, which leads to far more matches where either player has a reasonable shot.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Guilty Gear Strive\'s newly added ranks as part of the version 1.48 update." class="wp-image-9495" height="382" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ranked.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Plus, it takes somewhere in the neighbourhood of 25 consecutive wins to move up to the next rank, so moving up or down no longer feels like doing the <em>Cha Cha Slide</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just how the matches have felt that has made playing Ranked Match so pleasant though: it’s also reduced the time I spend in menus. I had to spend so much time finding, and connecting to stations while playing in Tower. This was only exacerbated if there were connection issues, which there frequently were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the new Ranked Match system, I simply choose my preferred matchmaking settings, which are saved between sessions, and press start. Then I wait until the game finds me a match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can not overstate how much better this feels to actually use. I can simply focus on playing the game, and making notes between sets instead of fighting with the game to get into my next match. I don’t even know if connection problems are as rampant as they were after the crossplay update because I’m not responsible for dealing with them anymore. All that shit is hidden, so I can focus on actually playing the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s glorious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Arc System Works</em> also addressed the complaints about how Tower used a unified rank for your entire account, and implemented rank on a per character basis. This just adds to the friction-less experience of using the new ranked mode, and is yet another reason why I’m very happy that it was finally implemented. I can now actually swap between <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2024/11/20/the-return-of-the-queen-queen-dizzy-first-impressions/">Dizzy</a>, and <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/01/19/guilty-gear-strive-may-guide-for-beginner-combos/">May</a>, whom I have vastly different levels of skill playing, without needing to ruin the experience for other players while <em>Strive </em>struggled to figure out which floor I ought to be on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was a little skeptical at first, but I’ve gotta give it up: this new ranking system is awesome. And that’s not to say that it does anything unique from other ranking systems. Quite the contrary. It’s just a normal ranking system, with very little menuing required from players between matches. I love how I can just press a button and boom &#8211; it’s <em>Guilty Gear</em> time. That is refreshingly straightforward, and has made my recent time playing <em>Strive </em>an absolute joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about you? Has Lucy or the addition of Ranked Matches piqued your interest? How’re you finding the new ranked system?

It’s been years since I’d read Isaac Asimov’s original trilogy, and I wanted to revisit that sprawling galactic history that had so fascinated me the first time.</p><p>But here’s the thing I hadn’t noticed before, and it hit me like a ton of bricks as I turned the pages this time around: everyone is a man. Every bureaucrat, every scientist, every trader, every political schemer. Even the minor characters. Women are practically invisible in those early books.</p><p>Back when I first read the series, I completely missed it. Maybe it’s because the story itself is so captivating, with its galaxy-spanning rise and fall of civilizations, or maybe it’s because as a young reader (mid-teens) I wasn’t looking for what was missing. But now? It’s impossible not to see.</p><p>Does this revelation ruin the story for me? Not at all. Asimov was a writer of his time, and Foundation was more about ideas—psychohistory, politics, inevitability—than it was about fleshed-out characters. But it does cast a new light on the trilogy. The “future” it imagines is one where half of humanity is strangely absent from the narrative.</p><p>That’s why I think the AppleTV+ adaptation does something important.

It’s been years since I’d read Isaac Asimov’s original trilogy, and I wanted to revisit that sprawling galactic history that had so fascinated me the first time.</p><p>But here’s the thing I hadn’t noticed before, and it hit me like a ton of bricks as I turned the pages this time around: everyone is a man. Every bureaucrat, every scientist, every trader, every political schemer. Even the minor characters. Women are practically invisible in those early books.</p><p>Back when I first read the series, I completely missed it. Maybe it’s because the story itself is so captivating, with its galaxy-spanning rise and fall of civilizations, or maybe it’s because as a young reader (mid-teens) I wasn’t looking for what was missing. But now? It’s impossible not to see.</p><p>Does this revelation ruin the story for me? Not at all. Asimov was a writer of his time, and Foundation was more about ideas—psychohistory, politics, inevitability—than it was about fleshed-out characters. But it does cast a new light on the trilogy. The “future” it imagines is one where half of humanity is strangely absent from the narrative.</p><p>That’s why I think the AppleTV+ adaptation does something important. It doesn’t just modernize the story with visual spectacle or personal drama—it rebalances the cast. Strong female characters take their place on the stage, shaping the same epic narrative with voices and perspectives that Asimov either overlooked or simply didn’t imagine back in the 1940s.</p><p>So, as I reread the books alongside the show, I find myself in a strange position: still awed by Asimov’s grand vision, but also aware of the silence between the lines.</p><p>A silence that, thankfully, the screenwriters have done a great job imagining.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/09/where-are-women-in-asimovs-foundation.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/09/where-are-women-in-asimovs-foundation.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiKHyVj9s0KeAC0JZ1JkDkmiD-xjZYetmhv-AeYOE2bHxm0F-MrAUPCqRm5dNQ3tgv-cFG9dNi_O8ep-W93YOe5KSmN96LtF3OLY-Yp6QfS_9VuNwMLZmvMVabqRAiLHIF6lP2DS0FN3BxNT5H_qARn_P0hBfJnTIzT269LiV3SL3KxVozIRxB-g/s72-w640-h426-c/20250919_0843_Foundation%20Trilogy%20Portrait_simple_compose_01k5gzx12nf0wv36c0wjdr622s.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '2'}

While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step. It takes the grand, operatic elements of Star Wars and grounds them in a reality where power is brutal, where ecological concerns dictate the survival of entire civilizations, and where messiahs are as dangerous as they are revered.</p><p>While Star Wars draws inspiration from many sources, including Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films, and Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey, the imprint of Dune is undeniable. Lucas mixed multiple influences to craft his space opera, resulting in a faster-paced, action-driven narrative compared to Dune’s more introspective and politically complex storytelling. If anything, Dune is a deep meditation on power, religion, and fate, while Star Wars leans into mythic adventure and the battle between good and evil.&nbsp;</p><p>Both have left an indelible mark on science fiction, shaping how we imagine galaxies far, far away.&nbsp;</p><p>Here\'s how the team at <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StarWarsExplained" target="_blank">Star Wars Explained</a></em> put it: <em>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Uz-lKT7Jc" target="_blank">How Dune Continues to Inspire Star Wars.</a>"</em></p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><p>In the end, simply know that for those who fell in love with Star Wars, Dune stands waiting—a richer, more demanding, but ultimately rewarding universe to explore.<br /><br />Further readings:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/star-wars-ripped-off-dune" target="_blank">How \'Star Wars\' ripped off \'Dune\'</a> - via The Week</li><li><a href="https://nerdist.com/article/everything-star-wars-borrowed-from-dune/" target="_blank">Everything STAR WARS Borrowed From DUNE</a> - via Nerdist</li><li><a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars-movies-wouldnt-exist-without-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Movies Definitely Wouldn’t Exist Without Dune</a> - via Den of Geek</li><li><a href="https://www.cbr.com/dune-star-wars-similarities-inspiration/" target="_blank">Dune: 10 Ways the Series Inspired Star Wars</a> - via CBR</li><li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonyorlando52/cool-dune-and-star-wars-comparisons" target="_blank">17 "Star Wars" And "Dune" Similarities That Seemingly Tie The Franchises Together</a> - via BuzzFeed</li><li><a href="https://gamerant.com/star-wars-was-based-on-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Was Based On Dune, And It Shows </a>- via Game Rant</li></ul><p></p></div>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq7tgJpqN-t3AdtgsPbsCw9nr-n-fGT077bVls28t9Lu_zvWivNPoomrDmXU5GKk-rvgPFZM_xSQVq8zWlVCOloEA1_kPCqJQuq2tWcx3bSekID1l8VTebx20UU39KimjohC-qAiYovrOJEqbS1oeajcXre8zQD-PYedtdbDWoUckG6ePMIiTkDQ/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202025-03-05%2008.50.03%20-%20A%20dramatic%20sci-fi%20landscape%20divided%20into%20two%20distinct%20halves,%20symbolizing%20two%20different%20universes.%20On%20the%20left,%20a%20vast%20desert%20planet%20with%20towering%20san.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq7tgJpqN-t3AdtgsPbsCw9nr-n-fGT077bVls28t9Lu_zvWivNPoomrDmXU5GKk-rvgPFZM_xSQVq8zWlVCOloEA1_kPCqJQuq2tWcx3bSekID1l8VTebx20UU39KimjohC-qAiYovrOJEqbS1oeajcXre8zQD-PYedtdbDWoUckG6ePMIiTkDQ/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202025-03-05%2008.50.03%20-%20A%20dramatic%20sci-fi%20landscape%20divided%20into%20two%20distinct%20halves,%20symbolizing%20two%20different%20universes.%20On%20the%20left,%20a%20vast%20desert%20planet%20with%20towering%20san.webp" width="640" /></a></div><br />Frank Herbert’s Dune and George Lucas’ Star Wars share a striking number of similarities, from their world-building to their overarching themes.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened. That bizarre, campy mess deserves to be locked in a vault and yeeted into a black hole. A clone-Ripley with alien DNA? A Xenomorph with puppy dog eyes? No thanks. Some things are best left unacknowledged.</i>).&nbsp;</p><p>And then, decades later, Ridley Scott returned. He promised to answer those burning questions we’d had since Alien. He promised us something epic, something profound.</p><p>Instead, we got <b>Prometheus </b>and <b>Alien: Covenant</b>—films that thought they were profound, but mostly just left us shaking our heads, wondering how some of the dumbest people in the universe got sent on space missions.</p><p>Let’s talk about the prequels.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Prometheus: A Beautiful, Dumb Mystery</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/s1200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/w400-h200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p>Prometheus promised us a grand exploration of the origins of life and the Xenomorphs, wrapped in a sleek, high-concept sci-fi package. And visually? It delivered. The ship design was stunning, the interior dripping with that clean, industrial aesthetic that felt like a spiritual cousin to the Nostromo (well the crew quarters really), only way more advanced. The planetary storm sequence? Pure spectacle.&nbsp;</p><p>The Engineers?&nbsp;</p><p>Towering and mysterious—though, let’s be real, their proportions felt wonky, as if Ridley Scott couldn\'t quite decide whether they were gods or just really tall dudes in marble skin suits. <i>Do yourself a favour—go rewatch the scene where the crew of the Nostromo first stumbles upon the Space Jockey. Take a good look at the proportions. That thing is massive, ancient, and downright eerie. Now ask yourself: does an Engineer really seem big enough to fit that chair? Yeah, I didn’t think so either.</i></p><p></p><p>Performance-wise, Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron carried the film on their backs. Rapace brought intensity to her role as Elizabeth Shaw, a scientist driven by faith and curiosity, while Fassbender’s David was the perfect blend of unsettling and fascinating—an android more human than the humans around him. And Theron? Her cold, corporate badassery added a delicious layer of tension.</p><p>But for all the things "Prometheus" got right, its flaws loomed as large as the Engineer statues. The whole "our DNA comes from a space giant dissolving in a river" premise felt half-baked at best, eye-roll-inducing at worst. If the Engineers were supposed to be our creators, why was there zero effort to explain their motives? Why did they want to wipe out humanity? What was this planet even for? Instead of storytelling, we got vague hints and unanswered questions wrapped in pseudo-philosophical musings.</p><p>Then there was the crew—easily the dumbest collection of scientists and astronauts ever put on screen. Removing helmets in an alien environment? Playing "here, kitty kitty" with a clearly hostile alien snake thing? These people made the space truckers from Alien look like Nobel Prize winners. And the mutations—ugh. Fifield’s transformation into a rabid space zombie was laughably bad, and don’t even get me started on the grotesque, beige "proto-Alien" at the end. It looked like a half-melted action figure.</p><p>Oh, and that rolling Engineer ship? The fact that Vickers—who had been competent up until that moment—somehow forgot to run sideways and got pancaked was the cherry on top of this frustrating mess.</p><p>"Prometheus" was a film of incredible potential, weighed down by weak storytelling and infuriatingly dumb character decisions. It gave us glimpses of something greater but never had the courage to actually show us anything meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p>Visually breathtaking, thematically ambitious, but ultimately… a beautifully designed pile of nonsense.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Alien: Covenant: A Gore-Soaked, Half-Baked Hybrid</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/s1296/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/w400-h225/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>If <b>Prometheus </b>was Ridley Scott\'s attempt at deep, existential sci-fi, <b>Alien: Covenant</b> was his half-hearted apology to fans who just wanted some classic Xenomorph carnage. And to be fair, it sort of delivered. We got facehuggers, chestbursters, and plenty of gruesome deaths. But at what cost? The film felt like it was straddling two worlds—trying to bridge the philosophical musings of Prometheus with the horror elements of Alien—and it never really nailed either.</p><p></p><p>Let’s start with the good. Visually, Covenant was just as slick as its predecessor, with some beautifully haunting cinematography. The ship design was solid, the eerie desolation of the Engineer city was striking, and the alien-infested sequences had some intense, gory payoff. And, once again, Michael Fassbender absolutely crushed it—his dual role as the psychotic David and the more naive Walter was easily the most compelling part of the movie. The flute scene? Weird, but Fassbender made it work. "I\'ll do the fingering" may have been unintentionally hilarious, but it also cemented David as one of the most fascinatingly twisted characters in the franchise.</p><p>But then we get to the problems—and, oh boy, there are many.&nbsp;</p><p>The crew? Somehow even dumber than the ones in Prometheus. These were colonists tasked with establishing a new human home, yet they made every idiotic decision possible. Landing on an uncharted planet without hazmat suits? Poking at alien life forms again? Splitting up the team when they know there’s a hostile presence? It was like watching a slasher movie where the victims are actively trying to get themselves killed.</p><p>The Xenomorphs? They felt… off. The Neomorphs were creepy, but they never really lived up to the terror of the original creatures. And when we finally got to a full-fledged Xenomorph, the CGI just didn\'t have the same weight or presence as the practical effects from Alien and Aliens. Instead of lurking in the shadows, dripping menace, the creature just kind of… sprinted around like a hyperactive dog.</p><p>And then there was that twist. We all saw it coming a mile away—David taking Walter’s place—yet the movie played it like some grand revelation. The final scene, with Daniels realizing the truth as David smugly locked her into cryosleep, had so much potential to be chilling. But it was frustrating because it was just another rehash of the same “crew doomed by their own stupidity” trope we’d already seen before.</p><p><b>Alien: Covenant</b> had all the ingredients of a great sci-fi horror film, but it never fully committed to either its horror roots or its philosophical ambitions. It wanted to be both a blood-soaked monster movie and a deep meditation on creation and destruction, but instead, it ended up being a half-baked mash-up that pleased neither camp.&nbsp;</p><p>It was more entertaining than Prometheus, sure, but it was also proof that Ridley Scott had no clear idea where he was taking this franchise.</p><p>But don\'t take my word for it, here\'s a detailed analysis of the franchise\'s decline by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Hollywood_Lore" target="_blank">Hollywood Lore</a>.</p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">So, there might still be some hope...</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Cautiously Optimistic About Alien: Romulus</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidtRyYz6hMg7b_QNx5GcMacBuC66Pja9OW8Gpx_BVcF_EXerphaUU2fuCG09Tmwon4j7eUTNHdz1Z-bf1C5xtaY2kbD5PEbZaKcw_EjHipyyeMr2LgUJrLbg4YXg9RfdrRvYGU68IiJsFho2TymSc0_S5zIXuqjERXopv2X5qA5w3zLmWZpvmvaA/s1288/BRNM7LTMLVED5O7ZYI5CNIX6LI.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidtRyYz6hMg7b_QNx5GcMacBuC66Pja9OW8Gpx_BVcF_EXerphaUU2fuCG09Tmwon4j7eUTNHdz1Z-bf1C5xtaY2kbD5PEbZaKcw_EjHipyyeMr2LgUJrLbg4YXg9RfdrRvYGU68IiJsFho2TymSc0_S5zIXuqjERXopv2X5qA5w3zLmWZpvmvaA/w400-h225/BRNM7LTMLVED5O7ZYI5CNIX6LI.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>So, after the Prometheus-Covenant debacle, should we dare to hope again? Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair. The film is set between Alien and Aliens, with a new cast, a new setting, and—hopefully—a return to the franchise’s roots.</p><p></p><p>Now, full disclosure: I haven’t seen it yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But from what I’ve gathered, early reviews suggest that Álvarez might actually get it. Critics have praised the film for leaning into the claustrophobic horror that made the original Alien so iconic. The visuals are supposedly striking, the tension palpable, and Cailee Spaeny’s performance as the lead, Rain, has been getting solid buzz. If Álvarez managed to capture that creeping dread of the original—without bogging it down in over-explained mythology—then we might just have a winner.</p><p>That said, not all reviews are glowing. Some critics feel the film leans too hard on nostalgia, offering little that’s truly new to the franchise. Others have called out a controversial digital recreation of Ian Holm’s Ash, arguing that it adds more distraction than depth. And there’s always the risk that Romulus ends up feeling like a well-shot rehash rather than a true evolution of the saga.</p><p>So, am I hopeful?&nbsp;</p><p>Cautiously, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like <b>Alien: Romulus</b> might finally be the course correction we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p><p>But I won’t know for sure until I see it myself.&nbsp;</p><p>And when I do, you can bet I’ll be back with my thoughts.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/s1280/Alien(1979).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/w640-h360/Alien(1979).png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p>When Alien burst onto the screen in 1979, it was the kind of film that crawled under your skin and stayed there.

And Theron? Her cold, corporate badassery added a delicious layer of tension.</p><p>But for all the things "Prometheus" got right, its flaws loomed as large as the Engineer statues. The whole "our DNA comes from a space giant dissolving in a river" premise felt half-baked at best, eye-roll-inducing at worst. If the Engineers were supposed to be our creators, why was there zero effort to explain their motives? Why did they want to wipe out humanity? What was this planet even for? Instead of storytelling, we got vague hints and unanswered questions wrapped in pseudo-philosophical musings.</p><p>Then there was the crew—easily the dumbest collection of scientists and astronauts ever put on screen. Removing helmets in an alien environment? Playing "here, kitty kitty" with a clearly hostile alien snake thing? These people made the space truckers from Alien look like Nobel Prize winners. And the mutations—ugh. Fifield’s transformation into a rabid space zombie was laughably bad, and don’t even get me started on the grotesque, beige "proto-Alien" at the end. It looked like a half-melted action figure.</p><p>Oh, and that rolling Engineer ship? The fact that Vickers—who had been competent up until that moment—somehow forgot to run sideways and got pancaked was the cherry on top of this frustrating mess.</p><p>"Prometheus" was a film of incredible potential, weighed down by weak storytelling and infuriatingly dumb character decisions. It gave us glimpses of something greater but never had the courage to actually show us anything meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p>Visually breathtaking, thematically ambitious, but ultimately… a beautifully designed pile of nonsense.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Alien: Covenant: A Gore-Soaked, Half-Baked Hybrid</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/s1296/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/w400-h225/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>If <b>Prometheus </b>was Ridley Scott\'s attempt at deep, existential sci-fi, <b>Alien: Covenant</b> was his half-hearted apology to fans who just wanted some classic Xenomorph carnage. And to be fair, it sort of delivered. We got facehuggers, chestbursters, and plenty of gruesome deaths. But at what cost? The film felt like it was straddling two worlds—trying to bridge the philosophical musings of Prometheus with the horror elements of Alien—and it never really nailed either.</p><p></p><p>Let’s start with the good. Visually, Covenant was just as slick as its predecessor, with some beautifully haunting cinematography. The ship design was solid, the eerie desolation of the Engineer city was striking, and the alien-infested sequences had some intense, gory payoff. And, once again, Michael Fassbender absolutely crushed it—his dual role as the psychotic David and the more naive Walter was easily the most compelling part of the movie. The flute scene? Weird, but Fassbender made it work. "I\'ll do the fingering" may have been unintentionally hilarious, but it also cemented David as one of the most fascinatingly twisted characters in the franchise.</p><p>But then we get to the problems—and, oh boy, there are many.&nbsp;</p><p>The crew? Somehow even dumber than the ones in Prometheus. These were colonists tasked with establishing a new human home, yet they made every idiotic decision possible. Landing on an uncharted planet without hazmat suits? Poking at alien life forms again? Splitting up the team when they know there’s a hostile presence? It was like watching a slasher movie where the victims are actively trying to get themselves killed.</p><p>The Xenomorphs? They felt… off. The Neomorphs were creepy, but they never really lived up to the terror of the original creatures. And when we finally got to a full-fledged Xenomorph, the CGI just didn\'t have the same weight or presence as the practical effects from Alien and Aliens. Instead of lurking in the shadows, dripping menace, the creature just kind of… sprinted around like a hyperactive dog.</p><p>And then there was that twist. We all saw it coming a mile away—David taking Walter’s place—yet the movie played it like some grand revelation. The final scene, with Daniels realizing the truth as David smugly locked her into cryosleep, had so much potential to be chilling. But it was frustrating because it was just another rehash of the same “crew doomed by their own stupidity” trope we’d already seen before.</p><p><b>Alien: Covenant</b> had all the ingredients of a great sci-fi horror film, but it never fully committed to either its horror roots or its philosophical ambitions. It wanted to be both a blood-soaked monster movie and a deep meditation on creation and destruction, but instead, it ended up being a half-baked mash-up that pleased neither camp.&nbsp;</p><p>It was more entertaining than Prometheus, sure, but it was also proof that Ridley Scott had no clear idea where he was taking this franchise.</p><p>But don\'t take my word for it, here\'s a detailed analysis of the franchise\'s decline by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Hollywood_Lore" target="_blank">Hollywood Lore</a>.</p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">So, there might still be some hope...</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Cautiously Optimistic About Alien: Romulus</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidtRyYz6hMg7b_QNx5GcMacBuC66Pja9OW8Gpx_BVcF_EXerphaUU2fuCG09Tmwon4j7eUTNHdz1Z-bf1C5xtaY2kbD5PEbZaKcw_EjHipyyeMr2LgUJrLbg4YXg9RfdrRvYGU68IiJsFho2TymSc0_S5zIXuqjERXopv2X5qA5w3zLmWZpvmvaA/s1288/BRNM7LTMLVED5O7ZYI5CNIX6LI.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidtRyYz6hMg7b_QNx5GcMacBuC66Pja9OW8Gpx_BVcF_EXerphaUU2fuCG09Tmwon4j7eUTNHdz1Z-bf1C5xtaY2kbD5PEbZaKcw_EjHipyyeMr2LgUJrLbg4YXg9RfdrRvYGU68IiJsFho2TymSc0_S5zIXuqjERXopv2X5qA5w3zLmWZpvmvaA/w400-h225/BRNM7LTMLVED5O7ZYI5CNIX6LI.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>So, after the Prometheus-Covenant debacle, should we dare to hope again? Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair. The film is set between Alien and Aliens, with a new cast, a new setting, and—hopefully—a return to the franchise’s roots.</p><p></p><p>Now, full disclosure: I haven’t seen it yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But from what I’ve gathered, early reviews suggest that Álvarez might actually get it. Critics have praised the film for leaning into the claustrophobic horror that made the original Alien so iconic. The visuals are supposedly striking, the tension palpable, and Cailee Spaeny’s performance as the lead, Rain, has been getting solid buzz. If Álvarez managed to capture that creeping dread of the original—without bogging it down in over-explained mythology—then we might just have a winner.</p><p>That said, not all reviews are glowing. Some critics feel the film leans too hard on nostalgia, offering little that’s truly new to the franchise. Others have called out a controversial digital recreation of Ian Holm’s Ash, arguing that it adds more distraction than depth. And there’s always the risk that Romulus ends up feeling like a well-shot rehash rather than a true evolution of the saga.</p><p>So, am I hopeful?&nbsp;</p><p>Cautiously, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like <b>Alien: Romulus</b> might finally be the course correction we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p><p>But I won’t know for sure until I see it myself.&nbsp;</p><p>And when I do, you can bet I’ll be back with my thoughts.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-alien-or-how.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-alien-or-how.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/s72-w640-h360-c/Alien(1979).png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

If you wanted to be a mage, you just cast spells. Prefer melee? Swing a sword. The game let you grow into your playstyle without punishing early choices.</p><p>It wasn’t perfect, of course. The story was serviceable at best, and combat could sometimes feel repetitive. The party AI wasn’t always the brightest, and the later entries in the series struggled to capture the magic of the original. But despite these flaws, Dungeon Siege delivered a pure, streamlined experience—an action RPG that didn’t require a strategy guide or 20 hours of investment before the fun kicked in.</p><p>Fast-forward to today, and many games demand an almost academic level of dedication. Want to play an ARPG? You better study build guides, or you might ruin your character. Enjoy survival games? Hope you’re ready for food meters, crafting systems, and base maintenance.</p><p>And then there are the truly massive, player-driven universes like <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/" target="_blank">Eve Online</a>. I loved Eve for what it was for me at the time: an intricate, living ecosystem of trade, warfare, and political intrigue, and most importantly a Community of players, bloggers, and devs. But it was also, and still is, a game where new players can feel utterly lost, drowning in spreadsheets, market manipulation, and ship fitting meta. <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/npe-update-teach-a-man-to-fish" target="_blank">New Player Experience (NPE)</a> anyone?</p><p>Eve is a testament to gaming complexity, but sometimes, I just want something simpler.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Games like Dungeon Siege, Diablo II, and Torchlight struck a balance between accessibility and depth. They were easy to pick up, rewarding to play, and satisfying without demanding too much mental energy.&nbsp;</p><p>That kind of design is rare now, and I think many players, myself included, miss it.</p><p>Not every game needs to be a challenge. Nor does every game need to be super simple, such as <a href="https://www.townscapergame.com/" target="_blank">Townscaper</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046030/ISLANDERS/" target="_blank">Islanders</a>.</p><p>Sometimes, we just want to unwind, explore, and let the adventure unfold naturally.</p><p><br /></p><p>Anyone else feel the same?</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/02/the-joy-of-simple-no-fuss-gaming-why-i.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/02/the-joy-of-simple-no-fuss-gaming-why-i.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://img.youtube.com/vi/FmGhIRqq4VQ/default.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment. Here’s a summary of all six options to help you decide:</p><ul><li><strong>Craftsman:</strong> Increases natural resources by 25%, providing an edge in resource-heavy builds or for cities situated in resource-poor areas.</li><li><strong>Strategist:</strong> Reduces the likelihood of incidents like fires by 20%, keeping your city safe from disasters that can disrupt growth.</li><li><strong>Trader:</strong> Generates passive income from trade routes, a reliable choice if you plan on focusing on a strong economy.</li><li><strong>Politician:</strong> Allows two additional decrees to be issued at a lower cost, giving you more control over civic policies and faster access to certain upgrades.</li><li><strong>Philosopher:</strong> Boosts cultural satisfaction by 15%, making it easier to attract and retain a happy, thriving population.</li><li><strong>Priest:</strong> Citizens make regular offerings of random resources, adding a steady flow of materials that can supplement your supply chain.</li></ul><p>Each path offers distinct benefits depending on your playstyle. For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city. Here’s how to create a well-rounded cultural hub:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Add the ceramic workshop to a district close to residential zones, maximizing its impact on citizen satisfaction.</li><li>Balance satisfaction areas carefully: Focus on health and creativity early on to keep citizens productive and happy.</li><li>Use decorative statues within districts. Strategically placed statues improve attraction and encourage population growth.</li><li>Expand the radius of cultural buildings. When feasible, prioritize cultural buildings that have a broader impact radius to maximize their effectiveness.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">5. Developing Infrastructure: Production and Trade Routes</h2><p>Setting up trade routes is essential for generating income and balancing resources as your city expands. In the playthrough, the author wisely establishes trade routes to sell excess stone and sand for gold, which funds additional buildings and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>\' trade and production systems:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure to unlock and build both the Horreum, a large storehouse, as well as the Macellum, a large market which will open up Trade Routes. Without these two buildings trade will not be possible.</li><li>Identify surplus resources. Selling excess materials like stone and sand brings in steady gold income, which can be used to fund essential upgrades.</li><li>Upgrade production buildings. Increasing output from woodcutting camps and quarries helps meet the growing demand for building materials.</li><li>Create a balanced workforce. Avoid overspecializing in one resource, which could create shortages elsewhere in your economy.</li><li>Invest in a larger marketplace. Upgrading the marketplace opens up more trade routes, offering new opportunities to exchange goods and expand your economy.</li><li>Manage trade efficiently. Check each route’s profitability and ensure you’re getting maximum value from each transaction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">6. Advanced Growth: Reaching the Tier 2 City</h2><p>As your city grows, upgrading to a Tier 2 city brings new buildings and capabilities, allowing for even greater development. However, this stage also introduces new challenges, such as managing faction tensions. Here are a few ways to make the transition smoothly:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Construct safety-focused buildings. Building structures like arenas can help reduce incidents, which become more likely as factions develop tensions.</li><li>Invest in cultural influence points. Advancing through the ages improves your city’s reputation and allows for higher-level upgrades.</li><li>Manage faction relations. Keep an eye on faction satisfaction levels and address issues before they escalate into conflicts. Certain factions may have different needs or preferences.</li><li>Create additional districts. As new buildings become available, expand your residential and industrial districts to accommodate a growing population.</li><li>Save resources for key upgrades. Some Tier 2 buildings are expensive, so stockpile resources like wood, stone, and gold to avoid delays in construction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">7. Unlocking Wonders and Advanced Cultural Buildings</h2><p>Once you’ve secured your city’s basics, investing in wonders and advanced cultural buildings provides significant boosts. In the video, the author demonstrates how to build high-value structures like the arena and the Agoge Center to enhance influence. Here’s a guide to prioritize wonders effectively:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Focus on the Agoge Center&nbsp;or library to boost cultural influence. These buildings improve city-wide satisfaction and increase your cultural reach.</li><li>Place wonders in high-traffic areas to maximize their impact. Wonders near residential zones offer bonuses to more citizens.</li><li>Consider safety upgrades for wonder districts. Building defensive structures near wonders ensures they’re protected from incidents.</li><li>Save resources for construction. Wonders often require substantial materials, so plan to accumulate what you need before starting.</li><li>Regularly expand surveyor cabins. This allows you to build wonders farther out from the core, increasing your city’s total area.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8. Optimizing Faction Management and Decrees</h2><p>At this stage, you’ll encounter factions with unique demands. Managing these factions carefully, especially if they develop tensions, will become an important of your city management. Use decrees and policies to mitigate conflicts and enhance your city’s stability.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Issue decrees strategically. Certain decrees, such as increased food production, improve citizen satisfaction or reduce faction tensions.</li><li>Manage faction trust levels. High trust prevents conflicts, while low trust increases the likelihood of incidents and disputes.</li><li>Consider faction removal if tensions rise too high. Sometimes, expelling a problematic faction is more beneficial than dealing with constant conflicts.</li><li>Create buffers between rival factions. Placing neutral buildings or parks between contentious factions can reduce interactions and potential conflicts.</li><li>Balance decrees for all factions. Ensure that no single faction feels neglected, as this can quickly lead to dissatisfaction.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2><p>Building a successful city in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;requires a careful blend of resource management, cultural development, and strategic planning.

Between work (or trying to find my next role), family, and the general madness of daily life (soccer practices and games, lifts to here and there, the dog, etc.), finding the time to sit down and really immerse yourself in a game can feel like a luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s where city-building games come in, and let me tell you, they\'ve been a game-changer (pun totally intended).</p><span></span><h3 style="text-align: left;">The Magic of the Pause Button</h3><p>First off, let’s talk about one of the biggest perks of city-building games: the ability to pause or stop the game whenever you need to. Whether you\'re deep into a session of Cities: Skylines meticulously planning the perfect road network or trying to ensure your colonists survive another day in Surviving Mars, you can hit pause and step away without missing a beat. No need to worry about respawning in an FPS firefight or letting your team down in the middle of a MOBA match (I could write a whole posts on all the insults I\'ve taken from World of Tanks players).&nbsp;</p><p>These game wait for you, not the other way around.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Meditative Moments in Gaming</h3><p>Additionally, city-building games offer something incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world: a sense of peace and mindfulness. There’s a certain meditative quality to watching your city grow, whether it\'s a bustling metropolis in Cities: Skylines or a fragile colony on the brink of collapse in Frostpunk. You’re not just reacting to what’s happening on screen; you’re crafting something from the ground up, watching your creation evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s like a digital Zen garden, where each decision is a small stone you’re placing just so, bringing order to the chaos. Oh the hundreds of hours I\'ve spent in my Cities Skylines cities, beautifying them with parks, trees and endless landscaping.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Building Something That Lasts (well, sorta)</h3><p>Speaking of crafting, there’s something deeply satisfying about the “building something” aspect of these games. Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge. It’s not about speed or reflexes; it’s about foresight, planning, and adaptability. In Frostpunk, for example, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death for your citizens, adding a layer of moral complexity to the game. It’s a challenge that’s less about adrenaline and more about thoughtful consideration—a welcome break from the usual high-octane fare.</p><p>City-building games like Cities: Skylines, Farthest Frontier, Per Aspera, Frostpunk, and Surviving Mars offer a unique blend of strategy, relaxation, and creativity that’s perfect for casual gamers, especially gamer dads.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re games you can pick up and put down at your convenience, offering a sense of accomplishment without the stress. So next time you’re looking for a game that fits into your busy life, consider giving one of these a try.&nbsp;</p><p>You might just find it’s exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" width="640" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><br /></p><p>Here\'s a short list of some of the games I\'ve enjoyed over the years:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about" target="_blank"><i>Cities: Skylines II</i></a>&nbsp;(2023) - The sequel to the highly acclaimed Cities: Skylines, this game takes city-building to new heights with more advanced tools, deeper simulation, and enhanced graphics.</li><li><a href="https://www.farthestfrontier.com/" target="_blank"><i>Farthest Frontier</i></a> (2022) - A survival city-builder where you manage a frontier settlement, focusing on resource management, farming, and surviving harsh conditions.</li><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/surviving-the-aftermath/about" target="_blank"><i>Surviving the Aftermath</i></a> (2021) - A post-apocalyptic city-builder where you lead a group of survivors to rebuild society after a global catastrophe.</li><li><em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em> (2024) is a city-building game where you guide a city through 2,500 years of history across four eras.

Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge. It’s not about speed or reflexes; it’s about foresight, planning, and adaptability. In Frostpunk, for example, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death for your citizens, adding a layer of moral complexity to the game. It’s a challenge that’s less about adrenaline and more about thoughtful consideration—a welcome break from the usual high-octane fare.</p><p>City-building games like Cities: Skylines, Farthest Frontier, Per Aspera, Frostpunk, and Surviving Mars offer a unique blend of strategy, relaxation, and creativity that’s perfect for casual gamers, especially gamer dads.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re games you can pick up and put down at your convenience, offering a sense of accomplishment without the stress. So next time you’re looking for a game that fits into your busy life, consider giving one of these a try.&nbsp;</p><p>You might just find it’s exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" width="640" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><br /></p><p>Here\'s a short list of some of the games I\'ve enjoyed over the years:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about" target="_blank"><i>Cities: Skylines II</i></a>&nbsp;(2023) - The sequel to the highly acclaimed Cities: Skylines, this game takes city-building to new heights with more advanced tools, deeper simulation, and enhanced graphics.</li><li><a href="https://www.farthestfrontier.com/" target="_blank"><i>Farthest Frontier</i></a> (2022) - A survival city-builder where you manage a frontier settlement, focusing on resource management, farming, and surviving harsh conditions.</li><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/surviving-the-aftermath/about" target="_blank"><i>Surviving the Aftermath</i></a> (2021) - A post-apocalyptic city-builder where you lead a group of survivors to rebuild society after a global catastrophe.</li><li><em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em> (2024) is a city-building game where you guide a city through 2,500 years of history across four eras.

It articulates a shared experience: the magic and awe of the original and prequel trilogies give way to a sense of dissonance as the saga transitions into a realm that feels overly simplified, seemingly tailored more towards younger audiences than the broad demographic that has long cherished the galaxy far, far away.</div><div><br /></div><div>This sense of oversimplification, where narratives feel like they\'re holding the viewer\'s hand too tightly, mirrors content designed for very young children, diminishing the saga\'s depth. Yet, hope shines through with the acknowledgment of "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3748528/" target="_blank">Rogue One</a>" and "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9253284/" target="_blank">Andor</a>" as standout examples within the new wave, praised for their complexity and mature themes. These entries demonstrate that the franchise can still offer stories that resonate with adult fans without compromising its universal appeal.</div><div><br /><span><a name="more"></a></span></div><div><br /></div><div>Star Wars, at its heart, was never just a children\'s story but a saga with layers of storytelling, character development, and a richly crafted universe that engaged audiences across the age spectrum.

Someone with extensive experience piloting TDs would likely tell you that the following are the best setups, crew skills, and playstyle strategies to help your team secure victory.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Vehicle Setup in Detail</h3><h4 style="text-align: left;">Equipment Choices</h4><p>For both the Hellcat and Super Hellcat, the goal is to maximize their strengths: mobility, concealment, and firepower.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Optics (Binocular Telescope or Coated Optics)</b>: Increasing your view range is critical. Spotting enemies before they spot you allows you to make informed decisions on when to shoot and when to relocate. The choice between Binocular Telescope and Coated Optics depends on your playstyle; Binoculars for more stationary play and Coated Optics for more active scouting and repositioning.</li><li><b>Gun Rammer</b>: Reducing your reload time significantly increases your Damage Per Minute (DPM), making you a bigger threat on the battlefield. Being able to shoot more frequently means you can exploit enemy tanks\' vulnerabilities more often.</li><li><b>Camo Net / Turbocharger</b>: The choice here is between enhancing your stealth with a Camo Net or boosting your mobility with a Turbocharger. The Hellcat, being slightly more geared towards ambush tactics, benefits greatly from a Camo Net. The Super Hellcat, with its enhanced mobility, can further capitalize on this with a Turbocharger, allowing for rapid repositioning and flanking maneuvers.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;">Crew Skills in Detail</h3><p>Developing your crew skills is crucial for maximizing the potential of your TDs.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Commander</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Sixth Sense</b> is non-negotiable for TDs. Knowing when you\'ve been spotted can save you from being quickly eliminated.</li><li><b>Recon</b> further boosts your view range, complementing your equipment choices.</li></ul><li><b>Gunner</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> makes you harder to detect, a key survival trait for a TD.</li><li><b>Snap Shot</b> improves your gun\'s accuracy during turret movements, allowing for more reliable shots after repositioning.</li></ul><li><b>Driver</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Smooth Ride</b> reduces the accuracy penalty when firing on the move, which can be beneficial in hit-and-run tactics.</li><li><b>Off-Road Driving</b> improves your mobility on various terrains, enhancing your ability to quickly get into position or escape danger.</li></ul><li><b>Loader</b>: If your TD has a dedicated loader,</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> further enhances your stealth.</li><li><b>Safe Stowage</b> increases the durability of your ammo rack, reducing the chance of being taken out by a single hit.</li></ul></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Super Hellcat | World of Tanks Best Replays</h2><div style="text-align: center;"></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Gameplay Tactics in Detail</h2><h4 style="text-align: left;">Early Game</h4><p>The initial phase of the match is about gathering intelligence and taking key positions without being overly aggressive.</p><p><b>Scout and Reposition</b>: Use your mobility to reach forward positions quickly. Your goal is to gather as much information as possible on enemy movements for your team. After spotting, fall back to a safe distance before engaging.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Mid to Late Game</h4><p>As the match progresses, your role shifts towards exploiting enemy weaknesses and supporting your team from the second line.</p><p><b>Hit and Run</b>: Identify isolated targets or support teammates by targeting enemies focused on your allies. After firing, immediately relocate to avoid counter-fire, especially from enemy artillery or hidden TDs.</p><p><b>Supporting Heavies</b>: Position yourself behind or beside your team’s heavy tanks. From here, you can safely engage enemies that are distracted by your frontline, using your superior DPM to whittle them down.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Map Movement and Positioning</h3><p>Understanding each map\'s key features and sight lines is crucial. Use terrain to your advantage, keeping in mind that your primary goal is to support your team by dealing damage from concealed positions or by exploiting enemy flanks.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Use Terrain: Always be mindful of hills, ridges, and other terrain features that can provide cover or concealment. Being able to shoot without exposing your tank is a key skill for TD players.</li><li>Avoid Open Fields: Open areas are death zones for lightly armored vehicles like the Hellcat and Super Hellcat. Move from cover to cover and stay aware of potential threats like enemy TDs and artillery.</li><li>High Ground Advantage: High ground not only provides a better view of the battlefield but also makes it harder for enemies to hit your tank. Use elevation to your advantage whenever possible.</li></ul><p></p><p>By focusing on these strategies and continuously practicing and refining your skills, you\'ll greatly contribute to your team\'s efforts and enjoy success in your Hellcat and Super Hellcat in World of Tanks.</p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How a Super Hellcat should tag along with...</h2><div><span><div>The Hellcat, with its blend of mobility, firepower, and limited armor, can significantly benefit from coordinating with certain types of vehicles on the battlefield. Here’s a breakdown of which vehicles a Hellcat should consider partnering with and why:</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Medium Tanks</h3><div>Medium tanks are versatile and can perform a wide range of roles, making them excellent partners for the Hellcat. Their balance of speed, armor, and firepower allows them to effectively scout, flank, and engage enemies at various ranges. A Hellcat can support medium tanks by providing additional firepower from a second line or by exploiting openings created by the mediums’ aggressive maneuvers. This pairing can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions, moving to support weakened flanks or to capitalize on enemy vulnerabilities.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heavy Tanks</h3><div>While heavy tanks lack the Hellcat’s mobility, they make up for it with superior armor and firepower. Teaming up with heavy tanks allows the Hellcat to operate from behind the frontline, using the heavies as a shield while it delivers precise shots. This partnership is especially effective in areas with good cover and long sightlines, where the Hellcat can use its excellent gun to support the heavy tanks without exposing itself to enemy fire. The Hellcat should avoid blocking the retreat paths of allied heavy tanks and remain ready to reposition if the enemy breaks through the frontline.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Other TDs</h3><div>Pairing with other TDs, especially those with strong frontal armor, can create a formidable defensive line that can deter enemy advances. The Hellcat, with its good mobility, can act as a scout or flanker for this group, identifying targets for the more heavily armored TDs to engage. However, this requires good communication and coordination to ensure that the Hellcat does not become isolated or targeted by enemy artillery.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Artillery</h3><div>While not directly tagging along with artillery, a Hellcat can play a crucial role in protecting these valuable assets from enemy scouts and light tanks. By staying relatively close to friendly artillery, the Hellcat can use its mobility and firepower to intercept and eliminate threats to the team’s artillery pieces, ensuring they can continue to support the team effectively.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Light Tanks</h3><div>A somewhat less common but potentially effective partnership can be formed with light tanks. Light tanks excel in scouting and can quickly identify key enemy positions. A Hellcat following a light tank at a safe distance can capitalize on the scouting information, using its accurate gun to take out spotted enemies before they can react. However, this requires the Hellcat to stay alert and ready to move, as the light tank’s fast-paced scouting can lead them into rapidly changing situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>When pairing with any vehicle, the key for the Hellcat driver is to maintain situational awareness and adapt to the battle’s flow. The Hellcat\'s strength lies in its ability to deliver impactful damage from positions where it is not easily targeted. Effective communication with teammates and choosing the right moments to strike or relocate are crucial for leveraging the Hellcat’s capabilities to their fullest.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">How NOT to play the Super Hellcat!</h2></span></div><p style="text-align: left;">One of the worst ways to play the Hellcat in World of Tanks is to treat it like a frontline brawler or a heavy tank. The Hellcat is equipped with a powerful gun and excellent mobility but suffers from very thin armor and a relatively open turret design, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fire from almost all types of weapons it encounters on the battlefield.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Mistakes in Playing the Hellcat as a Frontline Tank:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Engaging in Direct Firefights: Attempting to trade shots with enemy tanks, especially heavies or well-armored mediums and TDs, is a quick way to get destroyed. The Hellcat\'s armor is insufficient to absorb hits, and its relatively large profile for a TD makes it an easy target when exposed.</li><li>Ignoring Cover and Concealment: Failing to use the terrain, bushes, and other forms of cover to hide your tank and mask your movements negates one of the Hellcat\'s main strengths – its ability to strike unseen. Being visible on the front lines means you\'ll likely be one of the first targets to be fired upon.</li><li>Static Gameplay: Staying in one position for too long, especially on the front lines, can make you an easy target for enemy artillery and tanks. The Hellcat thrives on its ability to relocate quickly, providing support where it\'s needed and avoiding return fire.</li><li>Not Using its Mobility: The Hellcat\'s speed is a key feature that allows it to flex across the map, responding to threats, reinforcing failing flanks, or exploiting gaps in the enemy lines. Playing it in a stationary, frontline role wastes this potential, making the tank much less effective than it could be.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Avoid These Mistakes:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Play to Your Strengths: Use the Hellcat\'s mobility and excellent gun handling to engage enemies from unexpected angles, relocate frequently to avoid being targeted, and always look for opportunities to support your team from a distance or the second line.</li><li>Stay Aware: Keep an eye on the mini-map and be ready to move if you\'re in danger of being flanked, or if there\'s a more advantageous position you can take to support your team.</li><li>Engage Wisely: Choose your battles carefully. Look for targets that are engaged with your teammates, isolated, or presenting their weaker armor to you. Avoid head-on engagements with tanks that can easily outgun or outarmor you.</li></ul><p></p><p>By avoiding the frontline brawler playstyle and focusing on mobility, stealth, and strategic engagement, you\'ll greatly increase your effectiveness and survivability in the Hellcat, turning it into a formidable asset for your team.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final thoughts...</h2><p>Mastering the Hellcat and Super Hellcat requires patience, good positioning, and an understanding of when to engage or retreat. Remember, your primary role is to support your team by providing accurate and timely damage from a distance or flanking. Avoid direct confrontations with heavier tanks unless you have a clear advantage or support. By following these strategies and adjusting your playstyle based on the battle\'s flow, you\'ll become a valuable asset to your team and help secure victory on the battlefield.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p>Jumping back into World of Tanks after long hiatus, and a big update felt a bit like a cold splash of water yesterday - especially when I dove straight into battle with my Super Hellcat and ended up more like a skittish kitten hiding in the bushes (literally) than the fierce TD I should\'ve been.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, my gameplay was rusty, and the match didn’t go well at all.

While Fincher\'s film has gained appreciation over time for its atmospheric and stylistic contributions to the franchise, Gibson\'s unproduced screenplay remains a fascinating "what if" scenario that hints at a different direction the "Alien" saga could have taken, potentially offering a more direct continuation of the themes and characters that fans had grown to love in the first two films.</div><div><p></p><p><a href="https://www.audible.ca/pd/Alien-III-Audiobook/B07QWZH5J6?bp_o=true&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAt5euBhB9EiwAdkXWOzX75ZpJJpU6Dii1CcYZWuvJqkjite68jE0tYKh79hvBv7VOWtw46xoCvOgQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;ipRedirectOverride=true&amp;language=en_CA&amp;overrideBaseCountry=true&amp;source_code=GDGPP30DTRIAL548011723005L" target="_blank">Audible\'s audio drama Alien 3 was a brilliant dramatization of the Gibson screenplay</a>, and I highly recommend you give it a listen!</p></div></div>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/exploring-what-if-review-of-william.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/exploring-what-if-review-of-william.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijZHVqQ4oyLsuTd86BXSKGK7ouqMc8C27X9MnhsA4O-V34biRXo4AP55knQnbagEaStNOzUUy4IXGMA_e_YWULmNyD1v5r_Gp7k5smPivZITfQaALFI4CjVeC7Jdop5DvN7NUMB9VoLs4Ozxh4xw2qL4YCJry9GqUMaiplxGjNOOrKANt6D5_2hg/s72-w640-h360-c/Sigourney-Weaver-and-xenomorph-in-Alien-3.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

I got access to it the other day and have been playing around with it and comparing it to Chrome with Gemini AI.</p>\n<p>First, and scariest, thing I did with it was give it access to my (mostly dormant these days) Gmail account and asked it to help me clean up my inbox. I had a zillion emails from LinkedIn and I asked it to find them all and delete them. It got to work, talking through each step: searching for the emails, clicking Select All. Hitting Delete. Waiting and watching to see if the number when down, then searching again for more and deleting those. It was crazy to watch my browser basically running itself. I could watch the AI clicking buttons and so forth.</p>\n<p>The bad news is that it wasn&#8217;t smart enough to know that in Gmail if you search for emails from a specific address, and change the sort from &#8220;Relevance&#8221; to &#8220;Recent&#8221; you get a prompt to select all emails matching your search and can delete everything at once. To be fair I had to ask Google Gemini how to get to that feature which had apparently disappeared. So I&#8217;m no smarter than Comet.</p>\n<p>So that was cool but also creepy and after I did that test I revoked its access to my Google account. </p>\n<h2>Video Summaries</h2>\n<p>For another test, I was watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivjwcZwMw4&#038;t">1 hour long YouTube video</a> that was an interview that I was vaguely interested in, but not &#8220;one hour of my time&#8221; interested in. I asked Gemini (in Chrome) to summarize the video and it gave me a summary based on, not the video, but the text around the video including the comments. Not helpful. I asked it to summarize the video itself and it told me it couldn&#8217;t watch the video.</p>\n<p>But in Comet I loaded the same YouTube video and asked Comet to summarize the video itself. It did so, and as I&#8217;d watched about half the video I know that it was a good summary of at least the first half. Here&#8217;s the full text of Comet&#8217;s summary:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nHere’s a summary of the main points from the video “AI killed Hollywood | Amazon&#8217;s secret AI bet | Ed Saatchi&#8217;s scary prediction”:</p>\n<p>&#8211; **AI is Creating a New Medium for Entertainment:** Edward Saatchi argues that AI isn&#8217;t just a tool for cheaper VFX or content automation; it&#8217;s giving birth to a completely new artistic medium. This medium is *playable*, *remixable*, and *multiplayer*—where audiences and creators can interact with AI-driven story worlds, create new episodes/characters, and expand existing universes, not just consume stitched clips.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **From Modding Games to Modding Movies:** The talk highlights parallels to video game modding—fans remixing and spinning off their own stories—which may change how film/TV IP is used, giving fans and creators more freedom to create derivative works inside established worlds, all monetized by the original IP holder.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Simulation Is Key to Realism:** Saatchi stresses that realistic AI storytelling requires true simulation—persistent worlds where characters have context, rules, relationships, and logical spatial/geographical structure (unlike current generative video, which often lacks consistency). These simulated worlds are what make emotional investment possible.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Fragmentation and Remix Culture:** The future of media is described as fragmentary and multiversal, with endless remixing. Everybody could have their own Star Trek or Friends spin-off, leading to a more individualized but potentially atomized culture.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **AI as an Artist and Competitor:** Rather than just being a creative assistant, AI can now independently generate art and narrative, making it a *competitor* to human artists. Human creators become worldbuilders—designing the universe, constraints, and rules that AI uses to generate content.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Navigating Social Media and AI:** As AI-driven personalized storytelling evolves, it may converge with social media, potentially amplifying both creativity and existing concerns—like recommendation algorithms, echo chambers, and digital social dynamics.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Playable Movies/TV and Genre Innovation:** There’s new potential for interactive genres like *playable horror*, where the viewer’s choices and prompts directly affect the story. Comedy and romance are also seen as ripe for AI-driven experimentation.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Technical Challenges:** The conversation notes that current AI-generated voices lack emotional depth, and long-term coherence in video simulation is still a challenge. Simulation here is not just about physics or aesthetics, but about character psychology and emergent, believable storylines.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Advice for Creators:** Saatchi predicts future “studios” will be AI model creators (OpenAI, Grok, Claude, etc.) and that artistic opportunity lies in treating these models as works of art, infusing them with taste and locked-in story elements.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Philosophical and Sci-Fi Visions:** The discussion connects to sci-fi themes (like Iain M. Banks’ Culture series), the possibility of AI-generated consciousness, and how simulations could serve both as entertainment and avenues for advancing creative AGI.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Genre and Format Disruption:** AI may birth new genres, blend existing ones, and enable deeper audience participation (especially in horror and micro-drama formats).</p>\n<p>Overall, the video is a wide-ranging conversation about how AI will disrupt, transform, and expand the boundaries of storytelling, media, and creativity—beyond just Hollywood, into entirely new artistic universes and experiences, with big implications for culture, industry, and society.[1]</p>\n<p>[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivjwcZwMw4&#038;t=1224s)\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what it actually looks like (click to enlarge):<br />\n<a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comet_video.jpg"><img alt="Screenshot of Comet browser summarizing a video" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-278" height="1364" src="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comet_video.jpg" width="1689" /></a></p>\n<p>So note one of the summaries talks about &#8220;playable horror&#8221; (not a new concept for gamers!) and I asked Comet to find that bit in the video, and it did:</p>\n<p><em>The video discusses playable horror starting at the 51:44 mark. If you want to watch that segment, jump to 51:44 in the video—that’s when the topic “Playable Horror: The Next Genre?” begins.</em></p>\n<p>Now this video does have chapters and Playable Horror is the name of a chapter, so hard to say if it got this info from the video or from the chapter listing. So I gave it another test. At one point the guest was talking about the TV show Friends and mentioned Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment. So I asked Comet to find the segment where they talk about Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment, without mentioning the TV show. I was not disappointed:</p>\n<p><em>The discussion about Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment from Friends begins around 12:18 in the video. Edward Saatchi uses it as an example to explain why simulations are important for AI-generated content. To catch this part, start watching at 12 minutes and 18 seconds.</em></p>\n<h2>Shopping</h2>\n<p>OK, one last test: Shopping! First, I had already logged into Amazon.com on the browser. I should&#8217;ve tested without having done that but here was my prompt:</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m almost out of Old Fashioned ingredients. Can you go to Amazon and put Orange Bitters, Peninsula Cherries and Collins Orange Twists in my cart? These should all be found in my previous orders so should be easy to find</strong></p>\n<p>It went to work searching my order history for these items, finding them and adding them to my cart. When it had all 3 in the cart it asked if I wanted it to complete the purchase. I said yes, and then had to agree again before it actually pressed the &#8220;Submit Order&#8221; button and then I got this:</p>\n<p><em>Your order has been successfully placed on Amazon with overnight delivery for all three cocktail ingredients—Collins Orange Twists, Peninsula Cherries, and Fee Brothers Orange Bitters. You’ll receive a confirmation email, and the order will be delivered to your default address by 4–8 AM tomorrow. Thanks for your request!</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth nothing that I did this via text but Comet does have the ability to take input via speech. </p>\n<p>Giving the AI that much access to my personal email definitely made me uneasy at this point though I suppose in a few years time I&#8217;ll think nothing of doing stuff like that. But having an AI that can summarize a long video is pretty darned handy given how often I end up sitting through videos looking for 1 piece of info. For that if nothing else, Comet is a win for me so far.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/25/comet-perplexitys-ai-browser/">Comet, Perplexity&#8217;s AI Browser</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/25/comet-perplexitys-ai-browser/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2'}

I find it can be a really helpful tool a lot of the time, and a pretty fun toy to mess around with, too.</p>\n<p>This is all really new so I don&#8217;t have comprehensive thoughts. At first I was kind of unimpressed. There&#8217;s a Gemini icon in the top right of the browser window, but so what? I have a Copilot button in my Task Bar. But then I was working on a Codecademy course and needed a refresher on the difference between append and extend for lists, so I hit that Gemini icon and asked the AI to give me the skinnny.</p>\n<p>It did so, but it also referenced the page I was on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Codecademy page you are on provides an example of how extend() can simplify code. In the &#8220;Performance&#8221; section, it suggests using thread_sold_split.extend(thread.split(&#8216;&#038;&#8217;)) as a more concise way to split and add thread colors to a list, compared to a nested loop. This is a great example of how extend() can replace a for loop that appends elements one by one.</p>\n<p>For more information and examples, you can check out resources like the Python List extend() Method article from GeeksforGeeks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So at this point you&#8217;re either saying &#8220;Oh shit Google is tracking every page I&#8217;m looking at!&#8221; or you&#8217;re saying &#8220;Whoa, that&#8217;s hella cool!&#8221; Or maybe both of those things. I said both but overall the cool aspect won out. </p>\n<p>To give this another test I opened the PDF of a lease agreement I happened to have on my machine, and asked for a summary. It read the PDF and gave me a nice table of all the pertinent info. Of course you can do the same with Chat GPT or any AI by just uploading a PDF, but if instead of a PDF this had been a long and complex post on the web, I&#8217;m assuming Gemini could&#8217;ve done the same thing. That seems like something that can be pretty useful.</p>\n<p>Also, unrelated to AI and I don&#8217;t know how new this is, but Chrome now handles multiple profiles really nicely. I have two Google accounts and by using Profiles I can keep them nicely separated (not sure how true that is for tracking purposes) with different extensions and such on each. There&#8217;s also a Guest profile which seems like Incognito on steroids. I&#8217;ve been using that for testing sites for work.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think I&#8217;m back to being a Chrome user now.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of my poor Python performance review and Gemini referencing the page.

This finished the Strings module and as it was a Friday afternoon it felt like a good stopping point for the week!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/23/learning-journey-week-of-sept-22nd-2025/">Learning Journey, Week of Sept. 22nd, 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/23/learning-journey-week-of-sept-22nd-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

In the Lists module I finally learned what a tuple is. I knew it was a data structure in Python but that was all I knew. Basically it&#8217;s an immutable List.</p>\n<h2>Tuples</h2>\n<p>Or so I thought. Actually I just asked Coach Marissa about tuples and she scolded me for calling it an immutable list:</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><img alt="🧠" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f9e0.png" style="height: 1em;" /> So Why Not “Immutable List”?</h3>\n<p class="chakra-text css-1ltj640">Because a\xa0<strong class="chakra-text css-0">list</strong>\xa0and a\xa0<strong class="chakra-text css-0">tuple</strong>\xa0<em>behave</em>\xa0like siblings—but they’re\xa0<em>philosophically</em>\xa0different.</p>\n<table class="border-collapse border border-black px-3 py-1 dark:border-white">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class="break-words border border-black bg-gray-500 px-3 py-1 text-white dark:border-white">Feature</th>\n<th class="break-words border border-black bg-gray-500 px-3 py-1 text-white dark:border-white">List</th>\n<th class="break-words border border-black bg-gray-500 px-3 py-1 text-white dark:border-white">Tuple</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class="break-words border border-black px-3 py-1 dark:border-white"><strong class="chakra-text css-0">Intent</strong></td>\n<td class="break-words border border-black px-3 py-1 dark:border-white">“I’ll grow.

So in the name of due diligence <a href="https://realpython.com/python-mutable-vs-immutable-types/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I found a post</a> via conventional search and it seems to confirm that the AI wasn&#8217;t hallucinating. Can&#8217;t be too careful, though! Also &#8216;she&#8217; missed one point and it&#8217;s that tuples are smaller and faster to access, apparently.</p>\n<p>Any Python experts that read this and want to elaborate further in the comments would be MORE than welcome to do so!</p>\n<h2>List Comprehension</h2>\n<p>With Lists in the rearview mirror I started the Loops module. Submodule 1 was pretty basic until I got to List Comprehension which was a brand new concept for me.</p>\n<p>List Comprehensions, as far as I can tell, don&#8217;t offer anything that you can&#8217;t accomplish in a For loops but they&#8217;re supposed to be easier to read (possibly true if you&#8217;re familiar with them) and faster due to how Python is tuned (I&#8217;ll take that bit on faith).</p>\n<p>What I find weird is that the syntax changes depending on conditional</p>\n<p>So if you have a list:</p>\n<p><code>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code></p>\n<p>and you want to use List Comprehension to create a sub-list of all numbers over 4 you would do something like:</p>\n<p><code>over_4 = [ num for num in numbers <span style="color: #ff0000;">if num &gt; 4</span> ]</code></p>\n<p>But if you wanted a list of the odd numbers and the square of the even numbers you&#8217;d have to re-arrange things:</p>\n<p><code>odds_and_square_evens = [num <span style="color: #ff0000;">if num % 2 else num**2</span> for num in numbers]</code></p>\n<p>See how the conditional changes spots depending on if it has an else clause? Weird.</p>\n<p>For me, right now, that&#8217;s not easier to read than a traditional 4 loop but maybe I&#8217;ll get there eventually.</p>\n<h2>So Far, So Good</h2>\n<p>Have to say that writing these posts has so far been a good motivator for me and I&#8217;ve done more at CodeCademy in the past few days than I&#8217;ve done in the past few months.</p>\n<p>Today, for example, I had not finished the 2nd module and thought I was done for the day, but then wanted to make the Internet proud so went back and did more to finish it up. We&#8217;ll see how long that kind of motivation lasts but for now I&#8217;ll take it!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/22/learning-journey-day-3/">Learning Journey, Day 3</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/22/learning-journey-day-3/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

For example, to get the length of list my_list you do len(&#8220;my_list&#8221;) whereas I&#8217;m used to doing my_list.length.

I didn&#8217;t learn very much, but I suppose typing up the solutions was a good way to build muscle memory around Python&#8217;s syntax. (In case you&#8217;ve never done ANYTHING with Python, the weird aspect &#8212; to me anyway &#8212; is that indentation matters. Python uses indents instead of curly braces to encapsulate code chunks like the body of an IF statement).</p>\n<p>The next module was on Lists which to my layman&#8217;s eyes are arrays with a different name. I jumped in and did 3 of the 8 sub-modules, but I noticed I was starting to feel a growing sense of annoyance which is EXACTLY the sense of annoyance I get in my real job when I have to do trivial and boring work. I took that as a sign to quit for the day.</p>\n<p>But yeah, still firmly in &#8220;how to program&#8221; territory with explanations of what bugs are, what looping is, conditional and logical operators and stuff like that. Important things to learn if you are brand new to programming, but info that is the same in all languages so isn&#8217;t new to me. But this was to be expected.</p>\n<h2>Life&#8217;s Challenges</h2>\n<p>One of my biggest challenges in learning programming, or learning anything that requires thinking and concentration, is fatigue.</p>\n<p>I am a terrible sleeper. My brain is never more awake and alert than it is as soon as my head hits the pillow. To combat this I have been relying on sleep gummies that have a mix of THC and CBD, and too often, a strong drink or two before I go to bed. That combo gets me to sleep but it doesn&#8217;t feel like restful sleep. I think the nights where I have a couple of drinks are the nights my sleep is particularly unrestful.</p>\n<p>My partner is a night owl, too, and she doesn&#8217;t have a set schedule for her work. She often lounges in bed until 10 am or so. When I go to bed at night, she&#8217;s wide awake and chatty. That doesn&#8217;t help either!</p>\n<p>When I try going to bed earlier, she just wakes me up when she comes to bed, after which I&#8217;m wide awake and can&#8217;t sleep. When things get REALLY bad I sleep downstairs on the couch so I can turn the light off at 11 or something. But that&#8217;s not great either, both for domestic tranquility reasons and because I wake up with a crick in my neck from sleeping scrunched up on the couch.</p>\n<p>The end result is I generally get about 5-6 hours of crummy sleep every night and I am CONSTANTLY tired if my brain is not stimulated. Don&#8217;t tell my boss this but some days I&#8217;ll stop work and play an arcade video game for 15 minutes or so and that will rouse my brain better than another cup of coffee does.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a solution for this issue. Cutting down on the alcohol before bed should help the issue, but won&#8217;t solve it. Hoping once I get deeper into the learning phase of this project I&#8217;ll have fewer issues. When I&#8217;m engaged with something that requires me to think, I don&#8217;t have the same issues with fatigue. Quite the contrary&#8230;when I&#8217;m working on something I&#8217;m REALLY interested in I get totally wired and&#8230; you guessed it, wind up staying up too late. It&#8217;s a vicious cycle!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/19/first-day-of-school/">First Day Of School</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/19/first-day-of-school/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

I&#8217;m barely out the door and I am already at a fork on the road.</p>\n<h2>CodeCademy</h2>\n<p>On the one hand, last November during Black Friday I bought a year&#8217;s subscription to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a> and then mostly left it to rot between then and now. They have courses for both Javascript and Python. I did the introductory Javascript course (and I&#8217;m almost ashamed to admit I learned a few things from it!) but it took me a LONG time to get through because I get bored really quickly. I started their intro to Python course and the same thing.</p>\n<p>The problem for someone like me is that the Intro courses have to teach you not just the syntax of the language you&#8217;re learning but the fundamentals of programming as well. This means you get lots of &#8220;What is a Variable?&#8221; level instruction. I wish they had an &#8220;I know this material&#8221; checkbox you could click to quickly skip through that stuff, but instead you have to type out these super trivial (to anyone who has written code before) assignments in order to &#8216;pass&#8217; and move forward.</p>\n<p>I probably could just skip the Intro courses but I&#8217;m a little OCD and always feel driven to start at the beginning and go through all the steps. Yeah, in this series of posts you&#8217;re going to learn a lot about how weird my brain is.</p>\n<h2>A Free Online Book</h2>\n<p>My coach Marissa suggested another page. She suggested a free online book, <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automate the Boring Stuff With Python</a>, which is a book I&#8217;ve heard of but had forgotten about. Her reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not flashy. Not AI.</li>\n<li>But it teaches you to\xa0<em>think in Python</em>.</li>\n<li>You’ll learn loops, functions, file handling, web scraping—<em>fast</em>.</li>\n<li>Do the projects.</li>\n<li>Then burn it like a bridge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Which Path?</h2>\n<p>So those are the choices I&#8217;m considering. On the one hand, I paid for CodeCademy so it seems crazy not to use it. But damn does it put me to sleep for now. If I can push through I figure I&#8217;ll get to more challenging stuff. And CodeCademy has some gamification in there with levels to earn and streaks and stuff and I&#8217;m sort of a sucker for those.</p>\n<p>The book no doubt would teach me faster but I&#8217;d be more reliant on will-power to stick with it. But it might get me to where I can start noodling with my own projects a lot faster.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s actually a 3rd option: I also bought a subscription to <a href="https://brilliant.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brilliant</a> last November. It also has Python courses but Brilliant feels more like a game or something to pass the time while waking up your brain than it does a serious learning tool. Mind you my streak is at like 280 days of doing Brilliant but a lot of that was math and stuff, which was an interesting experience because it dredged up knowledge from High School. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the tool for me for learning a programming language.</p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;m going to try to push through the early levels of CodeCademy while I still have the sub, but probably won&#8217;t renew it. I just realized November is right around the corner. Once it expires I can move on to the book. I should be able to blast through it by then.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/19/the-path-less-taken-maybe/">The Path Less Taken&#8230; Maybe</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/19/the-path-less-taken-maybe/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

It&#8217;s really easy to feel pressured when everyone else is doing the thing.

I am going to try to record and post content to YouTube, on my own schedule, when I can. I can record sporadically throughout the day here and there when I have the moments, and do the audio at night when the house is a bit more quiet. I can learn how to edit, and still scratch that scheduling itch. I also want to continue to grow with my art, and I&#8217;ve been posting to Cara and Instagram, and doing a little bit of drawing every day. I&#8217;d like to get back on track with my reading journal, and posting updates over on my book blog. I have a lot of FOMO when it comes to streaming. I watch a lot of twitch streamers throughout the day while I do other things. I see their enthusiasm and love for their games and community.
