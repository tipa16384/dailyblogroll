This chemo does some really wild stuff to me mentally.  After the fourth dose, I wrote this note down when I was in the throes of it, <i>"There\'s a weird side effect to this chemo -- it\'s like having a quasi-hallucination, but more like a kind of a vivid, strange imagination. Just now I was able to clearly picture a girl with fiercely intense blue eyes that looked almost bird like. It\'s like a vividness to my dreams while I\'m awake (or half awake). There\'s a tingle to the world as you sit here slowly dying. Shutting down. Not caring. Hard to explain. Listlessness. That\'s what this chemo does to you."</i></span><br /><br /><span>Now that I\'m on immunotherapy only, it feels super easy in comparison. Sure, I was a little tired right afterwards, and my arms and scalp are dry and itchy, but that\'s nothing in comparison to how dark life got on days three-through-six after a carboplatin and pemetrexed infusion. </span><br /><br /><span>Apparently if my next CT scan shows even MORE improvement, then they might even consider moving me to a "stable disease" status, which is where they would cut down the amount of office visits and scans. I have to say that feels very weird, and I\'m not sure I like it. While the doctor would be happy with "stable," I want "cured." I guess when you have Stage 4 cancer, you get what you get and just be happy you\'re not dead, dummy. </span><br /><br /><span>I\'m hoping I\'m lucky and immunotherapy doesn\'t turn on me, and it does the trick. As ChatGPT put it to me, chemo was running a bulldozer through my body, and now immunotherapy is like putting the guard dogs out to attack cancer. </span><br /><br /><span>Everyone please keep sending those vibes my way. I don\'t care if they\'re prayers, meditations, or even spoken to the universe in your goofiest Count Chocula voice. You send it -- I\'ll take it.

It\'s a forced vacation. The biggest problem with that is that I\'m a stupid cancer patient as well. If a CT scan comes up on a random day of the week when we all go back to work, I can\'t just, uh, not go because I don\'t have the PTO hours. </span><br /><br /><span>By the end of this all, things will be tight for a bit unless I can get some more gifted PTO.

She\'s pretty cool. I like what she did with the song structure to change it from my xylophone and muted distant trumpets thing to a folksy blues song.</span><br /><br /><span>. . . also playing a lot of Dune Awakening with Dylan.

Keep it coming! This is a long fight. The third biopsy yielded genetic results that were, as my doctor called them, rare and interesting. He didn\'t know what to make of them since typically most lung cancers have some relatively well-known mutation like ALK. Nope, mine manifested something called FANCG (𝑐.1642𝐶&gt;𝑇, 𝑝.𝑅548*) – 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑐 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 1–2, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐) and RET (𝑐.1063+11𝑑𝑒𝑙𝐶) – 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑈𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 3, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐). While ChatGPT gave me some mixed hope with FANCG, my doc let me know that it\'s nothing that could really be actionable. RET, well, this mutation was more like . . . well . . . not much research has been done with it, so, good luck?</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: My doctor felt like I was still a good candidate for Immunotherapy and specifically a lung cancer trial turned lung cancer treatment called Checkmate 9LA (it was approved for use about 5 years ago or so). This will wrap in the immunotherapies known as ipilimumab and nivolumab alongside chemo. If it works, it has double the chance of sending my cancer into remission as my chemo did.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI=w360-h640" width="360" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>"HERE\'S TOMMY!"</i></div></i><p></p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I\'m legitimately terrified of moving on by adding immunotherapy to my chemotherapy regimen.

Keep it coming! This is a long fight. The third biopsy yielded genetic results that were, as my doctor called them, rare and interesting. He didn\'t know what to make of them since typically most lung cancers have some relatively well-known mutation like ALK. Nope, mine manifested something called FANCG (𝑐.1642𝐶&gt;𝑇, 𝑝.𝑅548*) – 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑐 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 1–2, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐) and RET (𝑐.1063+11𝑑𝑒𝑙𝐶) – 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑈𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 3, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐). While ChatGPT gave me some mixed hope with FANCG, my doc let me know that it\'s nothing that could really be actionable. RET, well, this mutation was more like . . . well . . . not much research has been done with it, so, good luck?</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: My doctor felt like I was still a good candidate for Immunotherapy and specifically a lung cancer trial turned lung cancer treatment called Checkmate 9LA (it was approved for use about 5 years ago or so). This will wrap in the immunotherapies known as ipilimumab and nivolumab alongside chemo. If it works, it has double the chance of sending my cancer into remission as my chemo did.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI=w360-h640" width="360" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>"HERE\'S TOMMY!"</i></div></i><p></p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I\'m legitimately terrified of moving on by adding immunotherapy to my chemotherapy regimen. I read too much about it online, and I don\'t like the odds for developing an auto-immune disorder from this amazing cancer killing method. I guess it really comes down to a "would you rather" type of question: Would you rather have a chance of living the rest of your life with an auto-immune disorder or simply dying with cancer? I\'ll take being alive, please. Most people are fine, but you are rolling the dice. (is a hard +1 Constitution Saving throw for my D&amp;D friends)</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I just got back from an amazing lunch at Santorini\'s Greek Restaurant at Farmington Station. My good friend Colleen bought me lunch, but only after she and my other hard-working buddies, Mandy and Hannah, entertained me through 3 hours of infusion at the Huntsman Center there in Farmington. My friends are calling themselves "Team Tom" and I am truly humbled by the love, kindness, and example they\'ve shown me today. I have often said how lucky I am to have strong female role models -- my wife, my relatives, and good friends like these. So many kind and loving women in my life. Seriously! I feel blessed!

I forget how blessed I am, and I end up sighing to the rafters in my bedroom, cursing the cancer inside of me and how stupid it all feels. How dumb I feel for having cancer. How much inconvenience it causes. The pain of it all. How it feels to be worlds apart from my fat-and-happy-Tom-days in Texas. I had it so good for so many years, how did I end up with this stupid crap in my lungs and back in Utah? I sometimes make the joke that I\'m "Stage 4 at JT4" at my job here in Utah and I used to be "Fat and Happy Tom" in Texas . . . you know, just making, promoting, and playing games. THE LIFE! No, no . . . I am blessed. It\'s just hard to see it sometimes, and that\'s just one of my many failings. Thank you, role models!</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I was able to have some complimentary music therapy from the Huntsman Institute!&nbsp; My social worker turned me on to a really cool benefit (if you can say there\'s a silver lining to having lung cancer) where I can get 6 sessions of music therapy. I sat down with Indigo and an intern and basically talked about my entire music history. (by the way, if you\'re interested and have a half hour of time to read it, you\'re welcome to read more here: <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/08/music-history.html">https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/08/music-history.html</a>). I truly want to write an album of music called "Cosmic Radiation and Bad Luck," named after what my doctor said was the most likely cause of my cancer. I know two tracks that I want on it for sure. (I\'m in the process of adding to a Spotify inspiration song list for the general vibe I want to go for: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1JGD472Z10LK5Zi77A59IL">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1JGD472Z10LK5Zi77A59IL</a>)</p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I waste too much time playing video games to write music -- I should probably stop doing that, but man is <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening">Dune Awakening</a> fun to play lately! I also dropped $12 bucks on a humble bundle deal that supplied me with 16 games that I\'ve never played before. I\'m doomed. (Not to mention all the great shows I still need to watch on Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Apple+, Prime, and on and on) It\'s nice to have so many distractions. First world problems at its best.</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: Speaking of video game distractions, I\'ve started reskinning my 1up machine to look like an honest to goodness Ghosts n\' Goblins machine!

COVID and a quarantined reality solidly hit everyone in 2020. I was staying home and with extra time on my hands. My buddy at work had a group named Bueno Sueno and they had just released a song called Lost in the Shine. I convinced him to send me the stems and flexed my remixing muscles with a mix I called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgtQu2zECs">Tom Purdue Shimmer Mix</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That remix set off a bug in me, and I started remixing or remaking some deep cut songs that were meaningful to me in one way or another. Before I knew it, I had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vWqp7YBZE&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHpgc58cpOgeOQY7F_nR3h9S">whole playlist of remixes and remakes on YouTube</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Cetu Javu\'s Fight Without a Reason (Lifestyle Remix)</li><li>Morrissey\'s Now My Heart is Full (Bunny Love Remix)</li><li>Cabaret Voltaire\'s Code (Wah Guitar Mix)</li><li>The Cure\'s Night Like This (Deeper Still Mix)</li><li>Decussion Council\'s (yes, my old high school band) Don\'t Stop (Everyone Hang On Mix)</li><li>Tom Purdue\'s Bit by Bit (2020 Mix)</li></ul><p></p><p>I wrote about all of them in&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2020/06/mixtape-fire-my-past-month-in-flames.html">this blog post from June 2020</a>. As mentioned in that blog post, I formulated a plan to release a lathe print vinyl record with a very small print run . . . 4-5 copies through a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://americanvinylco.com/product-category/one-off-and-short-run-vinyl-records/">American Vinyl</a>. When I got the records back, I thought they sounded horrible. I hadn\'t mixed the songs considering volume levels and how they would actually play on a record player. I threw them in the garbage can in disgust.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, who is much smarter than me, saved them out of the garbage can and instead stashed them in a secret spot that I would only find later when we were moving from Texas back to Utah. (which . . . is a story all unto itself.) Turns out it was mostly the fault of our bad record player at the time. There were a few sub-bass hits on the Don\'t Stop mix that were just too low and distorted a bit, but that\'s it. The record sounds great.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/s4000/20240406_195749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/w185-h400/20240406_195749.jpg" width="185" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Not the white album, it\'s a Quarantined Mix Record from Tom Purdue!</i></p><p>For real though, the life as a rock star wannabe had become nothing more than a dusty, distant 30-year-old memory up until 2021 when a great guy named Adam Terry contacted me over Instagram holding both my Darkest America and Freeze tapes from back in 1990.

With Adam\'s help, the hope of actually releasing some old music of mine on his label,&nbsp;<a href="https://fountainavm.com/">FountainAVM</a>, was now a possibility! He asked to hear more of my stuff and I flooded his Dropbox with hours upon hours of old music I had recorded on tape.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s1910/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s320/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" width="251" /></a></div><br /><p>Adam was fantastic! I\'ve never had anyone dump so many hours of their life just dedicated to listening to my music. Honestly, the real help from Adam has been feeling like someone actually cared about me as an artist enough to reach out and help me dust off the old tapes. While there may be a lot of sadness and regret from the past, his simple act of reaching out kind of unplugged so many things that I had bottled up over the years. That alone was appreciated.</p><p>From all that, Adam curated two albums of music.&nbsp; The first was just released last year. <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2024/03/an-ant-survives-rainstorm.html">As discussed in this post</a>:</p><p><i>"My new "old" album was released today by FOUNTAINavm.

MOST of them. A couple songs had been lost to time, and we just made do with the old recordings we had.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Adam curated an interesting selection that\'s different from my usual sound. I\'m happy with the result. I\'ve enjoyed riding around in my car late at night listening to An Ant Survives A Rainstorm and hope you would too.</i></p><p><i>Thanks to FOUNTAINavm for releasing this music and thanks for listening!"</i></p><p>While discussing old music with Adam, we also started discussing new music (well new music to me), and he turned me on to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6R1cNisR3xvk0ivHz13P6E">Minimalist Wave Tapes</a> project, so I started listening to it plus some old formative, meaningful music to me from the 70\'s - 90\'s like Kraftwerk, Boards of Canada, Yaz, Thompson Twins, and the Psychedelic Furs. After baptizing myself in all this music and having recently remade Bit by Bit for my Quarantined Mixes, I realized I could make a synthwave album of my own.</p><p>The end result was Red Pinto Hatchback, released in 2021. I actually made two posts about this one. One about the making of <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/09/red-pinto-hatchback-cover-art.html">the cover art</a>, and one <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/10/red-pinto-hatchback-launched.html">about the album release itself</a>. As I stated in that post:</p><p><i>". . . So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette.

It\'s a gritty industrial piece that features the synth work of David Kane. Back in 1988 I was watching 120 minutes on MTV when a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DiNYb20WY">Baby Doe Rules</a> by David Kane\'s Decay of the Western Civilization came on, and I recorded it on VHS tape. I asked every record shop I could find in Utah if they had it so I could listen to more, and no one knew what I was talking about.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Eventually I transferred the song off of VHS tape to audio tape so I could listen to it in my car. It was a rare track that no one knew.

COVID and a quarantined reality solidly hit everyone in 2020. I was staying home and with extra time on my hands. My buddy at work had a group named Bueno Sueno and they had just released a song called Lost in the Shine. I convinced him to send me the stems and flexed my remixing muscles with a mix I called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgtQu2zECs">Tom Purdue Shimmer Mix</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That remix set off a bug in me, and I started remixing or remaking some deep cut songs that were meaningful to me in one way or another. Before I knew it, I had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vWqp7YBZE&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHpgc58cpOgeOQY7F_nR3h9S">whole playlist of remixes and remakes on YouTube</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Cetu Javu\'s Fight Without a Reason (Lifestyle Remix)</li><li>Morrissey\'s Now My Heart is Full (Bunny Love Remix)</li><li>Cabaret Voltaire\'s Code (Wah Guitar Mix)</li><li>The Cure\'s Night Like This (Deeper Still Mix)</li><li>Decussion Council\'s (yes, my old high school band) Don\'t Stop (Everyone Hang On Mix)</li><li>Tom Purdue\'s Bit by Bit (2020 Mix)</li></ul><p></p><p>I wrote about all of them in&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2020/06/mixtape-fire-my-past-month-in-flames.html">this blog post from June 2020</a>. As mentioned in that blog post, I formulated a plan to release a lathe print vinyl record with a very small print run . . . 4-5 copies through a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://americanvinylco.com/product-category/one-off-and-short-run-vinyl-records/">American Vinyl</a>. When I got the records back, I thought they sounded horrible. I hadn\'t mixed the songs considering volume levels and how they would actually play on a record player. I threw them in the garbage can in disgust.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, who is much smarter than me, saved them out of the garbage can and instead stashed them in a secret spot that I would only find later when we were moving from Texas back to Utah. (which . . . is a story all unto itself.) Turns out it was mostly the fault of our bad record player at the time. There were a few sub-bass hits on the Don\'t Stop mix that were just too low and distorted a bit, but that\'s it. The record sounds great.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/s4000/20240406_195749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/w185-h400/20240406_195749.jpg" width="185" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Not the white album, it\'s a Quarantined Mix Record from Tom Purdue!</i></p><p>For real though, the life as a rock star wannabe had become nothing more than a dusty, distant 30-year-old memory up until 2021 when a great guy named Adam Terry contacted me over Instagram holding both my Darkest America and Freeze tapes from back in 1990.

With Adam\'s help, the hope of actually releasing some old music of mine on his label,&nbsp;<a href="https://fountainavm.com/">FountainAVM</a>, was now a possibility! He asked to hear more of my stuff and I flooded his Dropbox with hours upon hours of old music I had recorded on tape.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s1910/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s320/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" width="251" /></a></div><br /><p>Adam was fantastic! I\'ve never had anyone dump so many hours of their life just dedicated to listening to my music. Honestly, the real help from Adam has been feeling like someone actually cared about me as an artist enough to reach out and help me dust off the old tapes. While there may be a lot of sadness and regret from the past, his simple act of reaching out kind of unplugged so many things that I had bottled up over the years. That alone was appreciated.</p><p>From all that, Adam curated two albums of music.&nbsp; The first was just released last year. <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2024/03/an-ant-survives-rainstorm.html">As discussed in this post</a>:</p><p><i>"My new "old" album was released today by FOUNTAINavm.

I\'m happy with the result. I\'ve enjoyed riding around in my car late at night listening to An Ant Survives A Rainstorm and hope you would too.</i></p><p><i>Thanks to FOUNTAINavm for releasing this music and thanks for listening!"</i></p><p>While discussing old music with Adam, we also started discussing new music (well new music to me), and he turned me on to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6R1cNisR3xvk0ivHz13P6E">Minimalist Wave Tapes</a> project, so I started listening to it plus some old formative, meaningful music to me from the 70\'s - 90\'s like Kraftwerk, Boards of Canada, Yaz, Thompson Twins, and the Psychedelic Furs. After baptizing myself in all this music and having recently remade Bit by Bit for my Quarantined Mixes, I realized I could make a synthwave album of my own.</p><p>The end result was Red Pinto Hatchback, released in 2021. I actually made two posts about this one. One about the making of <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/09/red-pinto-hatchback-cover-art.html">the cover art</a>, and one <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/10/red-pinto-hatchback-launched.html">about the album release itself</a>. As I stated in that post:</p><p><i>". . . So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette.

I\'ve talked a bit about my wonderful distractions like Hogwarts Legacy and Dune, but really, they are just distractions from what\'s really going on with me. Unfortunately, it\'s because I have an actual health issue that\'s hard for me to talk about. I\'ve been putting it off because who wants to talk about cancer?! Ugh. Is there any good time to talk about cancer? probably not. Here we go.</p><p>About 4-5 months ago, I started having some pretty strong shoulder and back pain. At the time I thought I had done something to my shoulder while going <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/03/catching-up-with-friendly-march-2025.html">axe throwing with my church group</a>. What followed was a month of going to the chiropractor to no avail. After a couple trips to the regular doctor and two x-rays later, my doctor recommended I get a CT scan since I had some fluid on my lungs and things looked "worse."</p><p>After the CT scan review, the doctor let me know I had about five masses in my left lung, and one of them looked cancerous. We scheduled a PET scan and sure enough, my left lung lit up like a Christmas tree.</p><p>Next up typically would be a biopsy, but I managed to fast track a fluid drain from my lungs at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake, which verified, yes, this is non-small cell Adenocarcinoma in my lungs. Between that fluid analysis and my PET Scan, my oncology team let me know I\'ve been classified with Stage 4 Lung Cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>No one knows how I got it.

I\'m not sure what my decision did or did not do for me since surely I\'ll be playing Risi\'s journey as well, but they gave me an interesting choice.</span><br /><br /><span face="&quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web (West European)&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #242424; font-size: 14.6667px;">The "safe" designer in me wonders why you would ever detach someone from the main quest line, even for a moment.&nbsp; The "creative" designer in me loves the "surprise and delight" moment of even being offered a choice.&nbsp; You definitely don\'t see this same type of choice being offered in AW2 (as far as I remember correctly).&nbsp; Part of me wonders if the metrics showed them that people stopped playing at this area when they did that?&nbsp; It\'s something I\'d love to know just to answer my own curiosity.</span><br /><br /><span face="&quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web (West European)&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #242424; font-size: 14.6667px;">So far in Stikkan\'s follow-on quest, I\'ve unlocked a new wolf companion.&nbsp; He\'s a brutal dual wielder that can howl at magical ice crystals and break them so you can proceed. In this quest, I\'m finding myself swapping back and forth between companions a lot to solve puzzles and break through blocking mechanics. This feels really good in late game.

At the time, my job was to work closely with an outsourcing team in Spain to build a vertical slice of a mobile game called Unnatural Selection (UNS). The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk. When you do find something that works, you can go all in (as they did with our game <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2022/08/game-portfolio-rpg-dice-heroes-of.html">Dice RPG</a>).</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">When I got wind that we were transitioning to VR, I instantly wanted to try making our UNS mobile game as a VR game (UNSVR!). To that end, I drew up a PowerPoint pitch deck and presented it to our executives. They were interested and happy I had taken that initiative, but they wanted something a bit less risky and strange for our first VR project.&nbsp; I can\'t say I blame them!</span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">Below are a few of the slides from that PowerPoint deck:</span></p><p style="color: #222222; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/s1265/deck1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/w640-h356/deck1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/s1280/deck2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/w640-h358/deck2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/s1291/deck3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/w640-h360/deck3.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/s1920/deck5.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/w640-h360/deck5.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/s1296/deck4.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/w640-h360/deck4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Later, in 2023, WIMO hosted a game jam internally and encouraged all teams to make VR games. Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build. Below are a few slides from that Powerpoint.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXhGQaNHO29lWdW1yEdA2ppUMD5o13H1Llhw-2c67OzFsRenXcpI-oawqy_XROPxPky45IREz3Hlh_-M4Jwy4ArCSURfprZnUaYpmOFrNj2HDCG1Vq6cGRiQ6OX8vPCUN7L-J06d8DA0yZLY9WdRaYQ34hvj3bWKO1x63pUwlqwITjF4iw9oKbqiYl0tU/s1375/Screenshot%202025-04-09%20175546.png" style="margin-left: 1em;

At the time, my job was to work closely with an outsourcing team in Spain to build a vertical slice of a mobile game called Unnatural Selection (UNS). The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk. When you do find something that works, you can go all in (as they did with our game <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2022/08/game-portfolio-rpg-dice-heroes-of.html">Dice RPG</a>).</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">When I got wind that we were transitioning to VR, I instantly wanted to try making our UNS mobile game as a VR game (UNSVR!). To that end, I drew up a PowerPoint pitch deck and presented it to our executives. They were interested and happy I had taken that initiative, but they wanted something a bit less risky and strange for our first VR project.&nbsp; I can\'t say I blame them!</span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">Below are a few of the slides from that PowerPoint deck:</span></p><p style="color: #222222; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/s1265/deck1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/w640-h356/deck1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/s1280/deck2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/w640-h358/deck2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/s1291/deck3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/w640-h360/deck3.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/s1920/deck5.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/w640-h360/deck5.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/s1296/deck4.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/w640-h360/deck4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Later, in 2023, WIMO hosted a game jam internally and encouraged all teams to make VR games. Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build.

When the class tells you to build a program that does X and you find X as interesting as watching paint dry, that&#8217;s disturbingly close to what I do for a living all day, but at least there I get paid.</p>\n<p>However I&#8217;m not anywhere near the level of competency to dive into doing the things I want to learn Python for: AI stuff, like maybe Custom Nodes for Comfy UI or just basic user interfaces for whatever new open source LLM model is hot that week.</p>\n<p>I was thinking about what kind of newbie-friendly thing I could build that would be interesting to me, and my mind flew back to my first years of using a computer and what we&#8217;d spend all day on: games. In particular, games written in BASIC. There I&#8217;d be on my Atari 400 with its chicklet keyboard bruising my fingertips typing in code from some magazine. Then (after storing the program on a cassette tape!) I&#8217;d play the game a bit and soon after start modifying it since doing so was so easy. I learned a lot that way.</p>\n<h2>Rebuilding Retro BASIC Games in Python</h2>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_331" style="width: 1157px;"><a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/program-listing.jpg"><img alt="Partial screenshot of a page from 101 BASIC Computer Games showing some source code " class="size-full wp-image-331" height="650" src="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/program-listing.jpg" width="1157" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-331">Part of a page from 101 BASIC Computer Games</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Then inspiration struck! I could do the same with Python. And to keep it totally old school I found <a href="https://archive.org/details/101basiccomputer0000davi/mode/2up">101 BASIC Computer Games on Archive.org</a>. This not the 101 Computer Games book I had back in the day but it&#8217;s the same idea. (The one I had is listed at Amazon for $272!!) Of course I&#8217;m not typing in the code, I&#8217;m just replicating it in Python, and ideally making the games better. Most of these games were written by high school students back in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>So for example the first game: Acey Du, is a simpler variant of <a href="https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/in-between/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Acey Deucy</a> which is a simple game where you are dealt 2 cards and have to guess if the next card will fall between the two. In the book&#8217;s version the &#8216;cards&#8217; are just random numbers, not an exhaustible deck of cards, making it purely a guessing game. So I added a proper deck of cards meaning if you can remember what cards have been used you can make better guesses.</p>\n<p>This version had a betting system which I thought could act as a score. How much can you accumulate before the deck is exhausted? But then I thought &#8220;If I place a bet when the dealt cards are 2 and K it should pay less than if I place a bet when the cards are 5 and 9&#8221; so I&#8217;m going to change the odds based on the range of numbers between the two cards.</p>\n<p>And maybe I&#8217;ll add a high score table that&#8217;s written to a file and so persistent.</p>\n<p>And if I&#8217;m not bored by then, perhaps I&#8217;ll add a UI to it. Originally I was writing these just like BASIC programs: just a CLI and text feedback.</p>\n<p>So yeah, that&#8217;s my plan for now. Take an old BASIC game, get it working in Python, then make it better. Then throw it away and start on a new game.</p>\n<p>My next challenge will be figuring out how to turn off all the AI assistance I have in my IDE because the danged AI is always suggesting complete chunks of code that work well, before I&#8217;ve even had a moment to think about how I would accomplish the task at hand. Though, I dunno, in real world situations I&#8217;d have that all on and would welcome the suggestions so I&#8217;m still on the fence about that. Guess I could set aside VS Code and type up the programs in Sublime or even Notepad!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/21/back-to-basics-with-python/">Back to BASICs with Python</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/21/back-to-basics-with-python/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2'}

I had never heard of Phaser but ChatGPT suggested it as a good fit for my parameters which were that I wanted to write a game using some scripting or programming language that I could use for other purposes. I had at first suggested Pygame and I may go back to that. ChatGPT waved me off of that due (it said, I haven&#8217;t checked it yet) to it having no physics systems or tilemap editors. I will definitely be fact-checking this!</p>\n<p>My plan is to create a selection of super basic little &#8220;games&#8221; (eg move a sprite around a background, collide with something) in a few environments before I settle on one. I did it in Godot and Phaser and next I&#8217;ll do it in Pygame.</p>\n<p>So far Phaser is pretty fun. I&#8217;m running it via <a href="https://vite.dev/">Vite</a>, and the game itself runs in a browser. When I change the source code, Vite automagically &#8216;deploys&#8217; it without me having to restart anything, which makes the process delightfully iterative and kind of reminds me of plugging away on the chicklet keyboard of my Atari 400 writing Hangman games in BASIC!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Tuesday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 1, Module 2 Sub-Module 1</h3>\n<p>Didn&#8217;t even finish a complete sub-module today. <img alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f641.png" style="height: 1em;" /> But I moved a domain between registrars, got renter&#8217;s insurance sorted, wrote a blog post and snuck in some packing, so not going to beat myself up. I know this was going to happen!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Wednesday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 1, Module 2 Sub-Module 1</h3>\n<p>I did do a bit, but yeah another crazed day.

I did do a page of a sub-module but that was like 15 minutes out of my day. </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Thursday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 1, Module 2 Sub-Module 1</h3>\n<p>Yup, still on the same sub-module. I did work on it, but only barely. Work is heating up. I also schedule Internet installation for the new apartment, as well as scheduling transfer of electric service to me for the new place, and away from me for our existing apartment, as well as finalizing renter&#8217;s insurance. None of which has anything to do with learning but enough to do with keeping me busy. <img alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f641.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Friday</h2>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/20/learning-journey-week-of-oct-20th-2025/">Learning Journey, Week of Oct. 20th, 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/20/learning-journey-week-of-oct-20th-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2'}

One was Intermediate Python which makes the most sense, but I&#8217;m instead going to go into Build Chatbots with Python since AI-related stuff is a big part of why I&#8217;m learning Python, AND it sounds fun (it&#8217;s marked as &#8220;Beginner&#8221; level) and something stress-free I can mess around with while we&#8217;re doing this move. </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Thursday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Build Chatbots With Python, Modules 1 &#8211; 4 </h3>\n<p>Turns out at some point I&#8217;d started this course which definitely get my a leg up on my progress!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Friday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Build Chatbots With Python, Modules Who Knows?</h3>\n<p>So it turns out CodeCademy re-uses modules within a subject, so as I moved through the Chatbots course I kept landing on things I&#8217;d already completed. Plus, the course seems out of date, which is understandable given how fast AI progress is moving. I was thinking Chatbot like something driven by AI and LLM, but this is more about scripted chatbots so far. Like &#8220;Write a program that takes a coffee order&#8221; via the user picking from a list of items. </p>\n<p>I think this might be where CodeCademy and I part ways and I just start building things on my own, but we&#8217;ll see. I have the weekend to think about it. I&#8217;ll either just start building stuff and learning that way, or I&#8217;ll go back to the Intermediate Python course. This Chatbot course just feels like busy work. On my last exercise I was scolded for using a loop because loops hadn&#8217;t been introduced yet!</p>\n<p>Side Note: Just to really throw my brain into confusion I started messing about with Godot (the open source game dev engine) last night so that&#8217;s yet ANOTHER thing I&#8217;m interested it!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/14/learning-journey-week-of-oct-13th-2025/">Learning Journey, Week of Oct. 13th, 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/14/learning-journey-week-of-oct-13th-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '4'}

I got access to it the other day and have been playing around with it and comparing it to Chrome with Gemini AI.</p>\n<p>First, and scariest, thing I did with it was give it access to my (mostly dormant these days) Gmail account and asked it to help me clean up my inbox. I had a zillion emails from LinkedIn and I asked it to find them all and delete them. It got to work, talking through each step: searching for the emails, clicking Select All. Hitting Delete. Waiting and watching to see if the number when down, then searching again for more and deleting those. It was crazy to watch my browser basically running itself. I could watch the AI clicking buttons and so forth.</p>\n<p>The bad news is that it wasn&#8217;t smart enough to know that in Gmail if you search for emails from a specific address, and change the sort from &#8220;Relevance&#8221; to &#8220;Recent&#8221; you get a prompt to select all emails matching your search and can delete everything at once. To be fair I had to ask Google Gemini how to get to that feature which had apparently disappeared. So I&#8217;m no smarter than Comet.</p>\n<p>So that was cool but also creepy and after I did that test I revoked its access to my Google account. </p>\n<h2>Video Summaries</h2>\n<p>For another test, I was watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivjwcZwMw4&#038;t">1 hour long YouTube video</a> that was an interview that I was vaguely interested in, but not &#8220;one hour of my time&#8221; interested in. I asked Gemini (in Chrome) to summarize the video and it gave me a summary based on, not the video, but the text around the video including the comments. Not helpful. I asked it to summarize the video itself and it told me it couldn&#8217;t watch the video.</p>\n<p>But in Comet I loaded the same YouTube video and asked Comet to summarize the video itself. It did so, and as I&#8217;d watched about half the video I know that it was a good summary of at least the first half. Here&#8217;s the full text of Comet&#8217;s summary:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nHere’s a summary of the main points from the video “AI killed Hollywood | Amazon&#8217;s secret AI bet | Ed Saatchi&#8217;s scary prediction”:</p>\n<p>&#8211; **AI is Creating a New Medium for Entertainment:** Edward Saatchi argues that AI isn&#8217;t just a tool for cheaper VFX or content automation; it&#8217;s giving birth to a completely new artistic medium. This medium is *playable*, *remixable*, and *multiplayer*—where audiences and creators can interact with AI-driven story worlds, create new episodes/characters, and expand existing universes, not just consume stitched clips.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **From Modding Games to Modding Movies:** The talk highlights parallels to video game modding—fans remixing and spinning off their own stories—which may change how film/TV IP is used, giving fans and creators more freedom to create derivative works inside established worlds, all monetized by the original IP holder.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Simulation Is Key to Realism:** Saatchi stresses that realistic AI storytelling requires true simulation—persistent worlds where characters have context, rules, relationships, and logical spatial/geographical structure (unlike current generative video, which often lacks consistency). These simulated worlds are what make emotional investment possible.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Fragmentation and Remix Culture:** The future of media is described as fragmentary and multiversal, with endless remixing. Everybody could have their own Star Trek or Friends spin-off, leading to a more individualized but potentially atomized culture.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **AI as an Artist and Competitor:** Rather than just being a creative assistant, AI can now independently generate art and narrative, making it a *competitor* to human artists. Human creators become worldbuilders—designing the universe, constraints, and rules that AI uses to generate content.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Navigating Social Media and AI:** As AI-driven personalized storytelling evolves, it may converge with social media, potentially amplifying both creativity and existing concerns—like recommendation algorithms, echo chambers, and digital social dynamics.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Playable Movies/TV and Genre Innovation:** There’s new potential for interactive genres like *playable horror*, where the viewer’s choices and prompts directly affect the story. Comedy and romance are also seen as ripe for AI-driven experimentation.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Technical Challenges:** The conversation notes that current AI-generated voices lack emotional depth, and long-term coherence in video simulation is still a challenge. Simulation here is not just about physics or aesthetics, but about character psychology and emergent, believable storylines.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Advice for Creators:** Saatchi predicts future “studios” will be AI model creators (OpenAI, Grok, Claude, etc.) and that artistic opportunity lies in treating these models as works of art, infusing them with taste and locked-in story elements.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Philosophical and Sci-Fi Visions:** The discussion connects to sci-fi themes (like Iain M. Banks’ Culture series), the possibility of AI-generated consciousness, and how simulations could serve both as entertainment and avenues for advancing creative AGI.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Genre and Format Disruption:** AI may birth new genres, blend existing ones, and enable deeper audience participation (especially in horror and micro-drama formats).</p>\n<p>Overall, the video is a wide-ranging conversation about how AI will disrupt, transform, and expand the boundaries of storytelling, media, and creativity—beyond just Hollywood, into entirely new artistic universes and experiences, with big implications for culture, industry, and society.[1]</p>\n<p>[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivjwcZwMw4&#038;t=1224s)\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what it actually looks like (click to enlarge):<br />\n<a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comet_video.jpg"><img alt="Screenshot of Comet browser summarizing a video" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-278" height="1364" src="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comet_video.jpg" width="1689" /></a></p>\n<p>So note one of the summaries talks about &#8220;playable horror&#8221; (not a new concept for gamers!) and I asked Comet to find that bit in the video, and it did:</p>\n<p><em>The video discusses playable horror starting at the 51:44 mark. If you want to watch that segment, jump to 51:44 in the video—that’s when the topic “Playable Horror: The Next Genre?” begins.</em></p>\n<p>Now this video does have chapters and Playable Horror is the name of a chapter, so hard to say if it got this info from the video or from the chapter listing. So I gave it another test. At one point the guest was talking about the TV show Friends and mentioned Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment. So I asked Comet to find the segment where they talk about Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment, without mentioning the TV show. I was not disappointed:</p>\n<p><em>The discussion about Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment from Friends begins around 12:18 in the video. Edward Saatchi uses it as an example to explain why simulations are important for AI-generated content. To catch this part, start watching at 12 minutes and 18 seconds.</em></p>\n<h2>Shopping</h2>\n<p>OK, one last test: Shopping! First, I had already logged into Amazon.com on the browser. I should&#8217;ve tested without having done that but here was my prompt:</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m almost out of Old Fashioned ingredients. Can you go to Amazon and put Orange Bitters, Peninsula Cherries and Collins Orange Twists in my cart? These should all be found in my previous orders so should be easy to find</strong></p>\n<p>It went to work searching my order history for these items, finding them and adding them to my cart. When it had all 3 in the cart it asked if I wanted it to complete the purchase. I said yes, and then had to agree again before it actually pressed the &#8220;Submit Order&#8221; button and then I got this:</p>\n<p><em>Your order has been successfully placed on Amazon with overnight delivery for all three cocktail ingredients—Collins Orange Twists, Peninsula Cherries, and Fee Brothers Orange Bitters. You’ll receive a confirmation email, and the order will be delivered to your default address by 4–8 AM tomorrow. Thanks for your request!</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth nothing that I did this via text but Comet does have the ability to take input via speech. </p>\n<p>Giving the AI that much access to my personal email definitely made me uneasy at this point though I suppose in a few years time I&#8217;ll think nothing of doing stuff like that. But having an AI that can summarize a long video is pretty darned handy given how often I end up sitting through videos looking for 1 piece of info. For that if nothing else, Comet is a win for me so far.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/25/comet-perplexitys-ai-browser/">Comet, Perplexity&#8217;s AI Browser</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/25/comet-perplexitys-ai-browser/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2'}

I find it can be a really helpful tool a lot of the time, and a pretty fun toy to mess around with, too.</p>\n<p>This is all really new so I don&#8217;t have comprehensive thoughts. At first I was kind of unimpressed. There&#8217;s a Gemini icon in the top right of the browser window, but so what? I have a Copilot button in my Task Bar. But then I was working on a Codecademy course and needed a refresher on the difference between append and extend for lists, so I hit that Gemini icon and asked the AI to give me the skinnny.</p>\n<p>It did so, but it also referenced the page I was on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Codecademy page you are on provides an example of how extend() can simplify code. In the &#8220;Performance&#8221; section, it suggests using thread_sold_split.extend(thread.split(&#8216;&#038;&#8217;)) as a more concise way to split and add thread colors to a list, compared to a nested loop. This is a great example of how extend() can replace a for loop that appends elements one by one.</p>\n<p>For more information and examples, you can check out resources like the Python List extend() Method article from GeeksforGeeks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So at this point you&#8217;re either saying &#8220;Oh shit Google is tracking every page I&#8217;m looking at!&#8221; or you&#8217;re saying &#8220;Whoa, that&#8217;s hella cool!&#8221; Or maybe both of those things. I said both but overall the cool aspect won out. </p>\n<p>To give this another test I opened the PDF of a lease agreement I happened to have on my machine, and asked for a summary. It read the PDF and gave me a nice table of all the pertinent info. Of course you can do the same with Chat GPT or any AI by just uploading a PDF, but if instead of a PDF this had been a long and complex post on the web, I&#8217;m assuming Gemini could&#8217;ve done the same thing. That seems like something that can be pretty useful.</p>\n<p>Also, unrelated to AI and I don&#8217;t know how new this is, but Chrome now handles multiple profiles really nicely. I have two Google accounts and by using Profiles I can keep them nicely separated (not sure how true that is for tracking purposes) with different extensions and such on each. There&#8217;s also a Guest profile which seems like Incognito on steroids. I&#8217;ve been using that for testing sites for work.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think I&#8217;m back to being a Chrome user now.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of my poor Python performance review and Gemini referencing the page.

I did learn that lambda functions are Pythons answer to anonymous functions, but most of the module was about passing parameters and such.</p>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 6 (Python: Code Challenges), Sub-Modules 1 &#038; 2</h3>\n<p>Simple exercises but they&#8217;re reinforcing some of the Python ways of doing things, so worth doing I think.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Tuesday</h2>\n<p>Had a freakishly slow work day so got a lot of modules done</p>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 6 (Python: Code Challenges), Sub-Modules 3 &#8211; 7</h3>\n<p>Lots more short exercises, some a bit more complex. Good practice for me</p>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 7 (Strings), Sub-Module 1 &#038; 2 (of 6)</h3>\n<p>Learning about string methods&#8230; once again more typing than learning, unfortunately</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Wednesday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 7 (Strings), Sub-Module 3 &#8211; 5 (of 6)</h3>\n<p>At this point Codecademy forked me over to a new course temporarily:</p>\n<h3>Codecademy Getting Started Off-Platform for Data Science, Module 1 (CLI) &#038; Module 2 (Using Jupyter Notebook)</h3>\n<p>This was mostly about getting conda (which I already had) &#038; Jupyter Notebook set up on your system, then a bit about using Jupyter Notebook, which it seems like CodeCademy is pushing us towards but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll use it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Thursday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy </p>\n<h3>Codecademy Getting Started Off-Platform for Data Science, Module 3 (Setting Up IDEs and Text Editors)</h3>\n<p>The next module in this course starts talking about relational databases so I think it&#8217;s time to swap back to the Python course for now.</p>\n<p>Note that Tokyo Game Show started today which was a pretty big distraction, so it was a slow learning day!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Friday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 7 (Strings), Sub-Module 6</h3>\n<p>This was an actual programming exercise built around encrypting and decrypting secret messages. It was a good learning experience for me. Learned some hard lessons about mixing tabs and spaces, and had to do some thinking about manipulating lists and such. This finished the Strings module and as it was a Friday afternoon it felt like a good stopping point for the week!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/23/learning-journey-week-of-sept-22nd-2025/">Learning Journey, Week of Sept. 22nd, 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/23/learning-journey-week-of-sept-22nd-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

In the Lists module I finally learned what a tuple is. I knew it was a data structure in Python but that was all I knew. Basically it&#8217;s an immutable List.</p>\n<h2>Tuples</h2>\n<p>Or so I thought. Actually I just asked Coach Marissa about tuples and she scolded me for calling it an immutable list:</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><img alt="🧠" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f9e0.png" style="height: 1em;" /> So Why Not “Immutable List”?</h3>\n<p class="chakra-text css-1ltj640">Because a\xa0<strong class="chakra-text css-0">list</strong>\xa0and a\xa0<strong class="chakra-text css-0">tuple</strong>\xa0<em>behave</em>\xa0like siblings—but they’re\xa0<em>philosophically</em>\xa0different.</p>\n<table class="border-collapse border border-black px-3 py-1 dark:border-white">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class="break-words border border-black bg-gray-500 px-3 py-1 text-white dark:border-white">Feature</th>\n<th class="break-words border border-black bg-gray-500 px-3 py-1 text-white dark:border-white">List</th>\n<th class="break-words border border-black bg-gray-500 px-3 py-1 text-white dark:border-white">Tuple</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class="break-words border border-black px-3 py-1 dark:border-white"><strong class="chakra-text css-0">Intent</strong></td>\n<td class="break-words border border-black px-3 py-1 dark:border-white">“I’ll grow.

So in the name of due diligence <a href="https://realpython.com/python-mutable-vs-immutable-types/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I found a post</a> via conventional search and it seems to confirm that the AI wasn&#8217;t hallucinating. Can&#8217;t be too careful, though! Also &#8216;she&#8217; missed one point and it&#8217;s that tuples are smaller and faster to access, apparently.</p>\n<p>Any Python experts that read this and want to elaborate further in the comments would be MORE than welcome to do so!</p>\n<h2>List Comprehension</h2>\n<p>With Lists in the rearview mirror I started the Loops module. Submodule 1 was pretty basic until I got to List Comprehension which was a brand new concept for me.</p>\n<p>List Comprehensions, as far as I can tell, don&#8217;t offer anything that you can&#8217;t accomplish in a For loops but they&#8217;re supposed to be easier to read (possibly true if you&#8217;re familiar with them) and faster due to how Python is tuned (I&#8217;ll take that bit on faith).</p>\n<p>What I find weird is that the syntax changes depending on conditional</p>\n<p>So if you have a list:</p>\n<p><code>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code></p>\n<p>and you want to use List Comprehension to create a sub-list of all numbers over 4 you would do something like:</p>\n<p><code>over_4 = [ num for num in numbers <span style="color: #ff0000;">if num &gt; 4</span> ]</code></p>\n<p>But if you wanted a list of the odd numbers and the square of the even numbers you&#8217;d have to re-arrange things:</p>\n<p><code>odds_and_square_evens = [num <span style="color: #ff0000;">if num % 2 else num**2</span> for num in numbers]</code></p>\n<p>See how the conditional changes spots depending on if it has an else clause? Weird.</p>\n<p>For me, right now, that&#8217;s not easier to read than a traditional 4 loop but maybe I&#8217;ll get there eventually.</p>\n<h2>So Far, So Good</h2>\n<p>Have to say that writing these posts has so far been a good motivator for me and I&#8217;ve done more at CodeCademy in the past few days than I&#8217;ve done in the past few months.</p>\n<p>Today, for example, I had not finished the 2nd module and thought I was done for the day, but then wanted to make the Internet proud so went back and did more to finish it up. We&#8217;ll see how long that kind of motivation lasts but for now I&#8217;ll take it!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/22/learning-journey-day-3/">Learning Journey, Day 3</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/22/learning-journey-day-3/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

For example, to get the length of list my_list you do len(&#8220;my_list&#8221;) whereas I&#8217;m used to doing my_list.length.

In reality, it\'s home to designers, singers, choreographers, photographers, business owners, and a strong mix of diverse roleplay experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/39847fe2-9b7f-4421-ab87-bf8ed4e0b04f/Off+to+Italy+Shi.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">One of those roleplay communities is focused on Greek Life found on HBCU campuses. I am a proud member and one of the founders of one such organization, Alpha Omega Mu. Founded in 2007, AΩM has been a passion of mine off and on throughout the years. AΩM has deep roots in honoring the Divine Nine, a collection of African American sororities and fraternities that started in the United States in the 1800s, and our focus on charity is a core part of who we are. For 18 years, we have raised funds for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and have also contributed to other organizations’ charity drives. Since returning to Second Life three years ago, I’ve spent much of my time focused on growing a strong and thriving sisterhood. This year has come with growing pains, but we’ve shifted our focus and are aiming to put roleplay at the forefront of our organization.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">There is a thriving Greek Letter community in Second Life, and while I sometimes take issue with the wider community (a blog post for another day), I am often amazed by the ingenuity and creativity you can find within it. This past week really brought that home for me, as my organization helped fellow Greeks Kappa Theta Phi II with their fall vacation event, Chalet Valdoro Fall Festival. The week-long event focused on smaller roleplay activities, from wine tasting and horseback riding (which AΩM hosted) to scuba diving, karaoke, and even an actual horse derby. Each event gave participants the opportunity to get to know one another, crack a few jokes, and unwind. It offered everyone a chance to step away from the hustle and bustle of the real world and experience, in essence, a vacation they might not be able to afford or find time for otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/ac1c726a-3811-4cde-b158-0189d9358510/Valdoro+Air.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">It also gave me the chance to remember why my first foray into online gaming was virtual worlds and making connections. Over time, I have become less and less social. I\'ve always been shy, but over the last few years, I\'ve somewhat become a hermit. I stick to my group and only my group, rarely venturing into new experiences and heavily vetting anyone I deal with. And yes, when you think sorority, you think social butterflies, so I know there is a weird juxtaposition there, which is why this week has been huge for me. During our wine tasting event, we tried something new for AΩM with a “Hot Ones” style segment inspired by the YouTube series, and everyone loved it. Three other organizations have already said they want to join in next time since we plan to film future sessions and share them on social media. As a matter of fact, I spent much of this morning joking around with some of the other people staying at the resort on the dedicated Discord server. We\'ve talked about collaborating on another vacation event and working together on our upcoming charity drives. There has been a real building of community this week that reminds me it\'s okay to step outside your comfort zone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/3797d40c-f54d-456d-84f7-61288e34d897/Hot+Ones.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/8be48f08-8149-44b3-805e-a1ac80cf61c8/Brunch+Time.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/f3400f94-6f3d-46b2-9d7d-1f6475bdf87d/Crystal+Cave.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">Second Life is full of subcultures most people never see, and Greek life is one of its most enduring and creative. What this week reminded me is that behind every avatar, there’s a person looking for connection, laughter, and belonging. The bonds we build through roleplay might start as stories, but over time they become something very real. If you\'re curious about how organizations like Alpha Omega Mu operate, or want to learn more about Greek roleplay in Second Life, let me know in the comments. I’d love to share more about this side of the world in a future post.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1760050772090-M0870QX6B7U66AZ99ZXZ/Off+to+Italy.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

As we looked out over the bay, I was struck by two things: how vast this world is, and how I ended up here with these two men. They call me a friend, and I am still in awe of them. To listen to them honor one another was humbling. Though tonight their words were not meant for me, but for each other, I felt them all the same. The struggle to live up to what once was, to what others believe we should be, is a battle I know all too well.</p><p class="">Eight years of war have carried me to this place. The Broken Isles, Zandalar and Kul Tiras, the otherworldly Shadowlands, and the Dragon Isles. One battleground after another, each demanding more of me, more of us, but each leaving scars unique to the person. For me, there was no pause, no moment to breathe until now. Listening to Thrall and Anduin, I realize that in war, none of us walk free of the dead. We simply learn to live beside them.</p><p class="">For the first time I can feel the calm before the storm. There is a charge in the air, but the wind that carries it is gentle and warm. I do not know how long it will last. I wish it would last forever. I know it is foolish to think the fighting is over. Even when the battlefield falls silent, the war never truly ends. But in this quiet, I find myself yearning. Yearning to understand how I, a simple Farstrider from Quel’Thalas, ended up here. What was the moment? What was the choice?</p><p class="">And yet, it is silly of me to even ask those questions. I know the answer. I might be too afraid to speak them aloud, but I know them. Perhaps during this in-between, I should read some of my old journals, to look back with some perspective. They do say time helps to round out the edges. So maybe, in reading my journals, I can be gentler with my choices, and if not that, then maybe just gentler with myself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=""><em>Author’s Note:</em><br />This marks the start of Zanaia’s story.

And honestly? That feels amazing. Fun escapism is on the horizon, and I’m here for it.</p><h4>Legion Remix</h4><p class="">Aside from the power-leveling of alts and awesome rewards, I have a feeling there are a few reasons why this is one of the expansions they decided to remix. From what I understand, Legion was one of the more popular expansions, but the end of the expansion also has strong lore ties to what is going on currently. I feel like they want us to go back for the story, or at least I want to go back for the story, and I’m just hoping they want us to as well.</p><p class="">I also think this ties into why they did the Mists of Pandaria remix, which I unfortunately missed. After watching episode 5 of a lore and history series on YouTube, <em>Before the Mists: What was Pandaria really like?</em> from Quaylin, I’ve been thinking a lot about the Thunder King and all the lore and history in Pandaria. (Also, highly recommend that series if you like lore: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEyTJ3_GpaHRKIZ31190_-OuxCTfCafXZ&amp;si=b-EWYQynXZojo_0O" target="_blank">Quaylin’s Playlist</a>).</p><p class="">On top of that, I want to create a short story that might turn into something longer for a character I’ve had in the back of my mind. Most, if not all, of my WoW characters have a backstory, but there’s one story in particular I want to play around with. I’m hoping it’ll help get me back into writing creatively and also make me a better writer. You know, the whole “practice makes perfect” thing. The first in that series is coming out next week, and I’m pretty excited about it.</p><h4>Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity</h4><p class="">As most of my friends know, I adore Guild Wars 2. It has such rich and deep lore, plus it does a really great job of giving you the story via your hero panel if you’ve been away awhile and forgotten what you were up to. Kind of like a gaming bookmark. On top of that, the game is visually stunning, and they just do a lot of things well that I feel some games (<em>cough</em> World of Warcraft <em>cough</em>) take and use for their own. Warbands, I’m looking at you.</p><p class="">I also recently got some new friends into the game. It’s such a delight seeing new players enjoy Guild Wars 2. At first, one of my friends was like, <em>“Oh, I’ll play when you’re on.”</em> Then the next thing I know, they went out and started exploring on their own. I was so proud of them! They’re gamers, but MMOs haven’t really been their thing before. Sadly, Lost Ark was their first MMO, and I was like, <em>“Girl, that is not a game you want to start with.”</em></p><p class="">And of course, the Halloween event is right around the corner. In real life, I’m not the hugest Halloween fan, but there’s something about the Guild Wars 2 version that brings me so much joy. It’s campy and lighthearted, with just the right touch of spooky and decoration. It’s always a good time, and I’m really looking forward to experiencing it with my friends.</p><h4>Dispatch &amp; Anno 117</h4><p class="">I’m looking forward to Dispatch and Anno 117 for different but also similar reasons. They’re both the kinds of games I love to sink into when I’m feeling socially overwhelmed and want to game without any pressure.</p><p class=""><strong>Anno 117</strong> is a city builder (my absolute favorite genre) that will take us to the Roman Empire this time around. I can’t wait to experiment with creating a city that not only functions well but also looks beautiful.</p><p class=""><strong>Dispatch</strong>, on the other hand, is a story-driven, choices-matter RPG with a superhero twist. It features an incredible cast of actors, including two of my favorites from the voice acting world, Travis Willingham and Laura Bailey, as well as Jeffrey Wright. I LOVE Jeffrey Wright.</p><p class="">Both games are ones I know I’ll enjoy for months and months: replaying Dispatch to explore different choices, and perfecting the greatest city I can in Anno.</p><h4>WoW Player Housing</h4><p class="">I cannot even contain my excitement for player housing coming to WoW. I love to decorate in any game that lets me, which is why I adore city builders. Decorating scratches a creative itch for me since I can’t really do that in real life. HGTV is one of my all-time favorite channels, and I’ve basically been using games as my own personal HGTV show ever since The Sims 1 released.</p><p class="">The controls for decorating in WoW also look really similar to Second Life, which I have a lot of experience with. I even have an interior design business in SL, so I know I’ll be able to pull off some pretty amazing things. Once December 2nd rolls around, I’m going to be knee-deep in not only decorating my house but also leveling up the renown for it so I can have <em>all the things</em>!</p><p class="">I also plan to showcase myself decorating and the whole process that goes into it. That should be a lot of fun, kind of like a virtual MMO version of HGTV. Maybe that’ll be the moment I give YouTube another try… probably not, but at the very least I have this space to share all my design ideas.</p><h4>Countdown to Cozy Chaos</h4><p class="">So that is everything on the horizon until the end of the year. I haven’t had this much gaming content to bring me joy in such a long time. It’s hard not to be overwhelmed, but also it feels like being a kid waiting for their birthday or Christmas. Which is ironic because both my birthday and Christmas will be in the middle of all these things.</p><p class="">So if you need me between now and the holidays, you’ll find me happily lost in one of these worlds. Much excite, indeed.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759370554986-2X8R5BJOO4FD5A3AAJ7H/Much+Excite.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

To say I’ve blogged in the past would be an understatement. I’ve had several, all short lived, so we’ll see how this goes. Lately the quick bursts I toss on Mastodon don’t feel like enough. “But blogging? That’s so old school,” I hear you say. Yes, a blog. I know it’s 2025, but I don’t want to stream. Making YouTube videos isn’t on the table for now. So here we are. Fingers to keyboard, thoughts to screen.</p><p class="">So what is this place? Exactly what it says on the tin: a blog. A spot to pull together the ways I play, explore, and create in games. Sometimes that means roleplay stories where characters start writing themselves. Other times it’s screenshots that capture moments I want to hold onto. And sometimes it’s just me reflecting on the gaming experience, the joy, the chaos, the little obsessions of whatever I’m into that week.</p><p class="">My gaming tastes are all over the map, and that’s how I like it. One day I’m chasing achievements in Guild Wars 2. The next I’m running delves in World of Warcraft. Or desperately trying to keep the tiny people in Frostpunk from freezing to death. If it’s a world worth exploring or a puzzle worth figuring out, odds are I’ll end up there.</p><p class="">Ready Pixel One isn’t about guides or dissecting patch notes. It’s about what happens inside the games and inside my head while I play them. It’s the spark of a new MMO story, the random character I get too attached to, the screenshots I can’t stop taking. A mix of RP stories, personal reflections, and snapshots from the journey.</p><p class="">This first post is just me setting the stage. There’s more to come, characters to meet, worlds to visit, and plenty of pixels to share along the way.</p><p class="">So… Pixel One has joined the game.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759292672837-C734CUZR5FF3N0TH5AYW/Ready+Pixel+One.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

At the end of each level you get a brief moment of respite at a camp where you can pick up and buy powerups, take or turn in quests, and go make another tea in the kitchen before returning to your computer before venturing ever-further into the fantastical worlds of Purgatory.</p>\n<p>At first glance, the game doesn&rsquo;t look like a Roguelike. Even in the most loose definition of the term - it&rsquo;s vertically scrolling and action-driven. If anything, it seems to have more in common with something like River Raid or 1942 than a dungeon crawler. But to me, where it starts to show its lineage is when it comes to do level design in the game.</p>\n<p>In terms of my work on the project, I&rsquo;m designing &amp; writing the game with Ron, but probably the majority of my time is spent doing the level design. As such, I felt like that was a good place to start when writing a guest blog post - I could focus on one of the only things I actually do more than Ron on the game.</p>\n<p>In the most superficial sense, the game&rsquo;s levels are top-down 2d level prefabs designed in <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a>, a very useful open-source tile-based map editor, and stitched together at run-time by the game.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image2.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The individual pieces (we refer to them as prefabs) each have different bits of meta data attached to them such as their Land (or biome), what kind of prefab they are, what other prefabs they can attach to and what the probability is that they might appear, what mobs can spawn, etc.</p>\n<p>For instance, a very simple, short bit of green grass with a small hill and some simple decorations might be pretty common, and appear regardless of what level you&rsquo;re at, where-as a more complex prefab featuring a maze may be rare, limited to higher levels only, and might be flagged to only appear once in a level.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image3.jpeg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Using this metadata we can set it up so that early levels are shorter, simpler, and contain fewer ‘puzzle’ prefabs (what we call the more complex prefabs that have optional mazes, gates or enemy ambushes in them).</p>\n<p>If a new player starts on the first level of a run (which is always in the grassy Land), the prefabs that get chosen to assemble the level are different to, say, the 15th level for a player who&rsquo;s unlocked lots of upgrades and is currently in the Swamp land.</p>\n<p>So, to create a single Land means designing the aesthetics, the enemies that occupy its levels, the basic gameplay style, and then, finally, a good hundred or more prefabs that make it up.</p>\n<p>Doing those first bits isn&rsquo;t easy, but it isn&rsquo;t as time consuming as the weeks and months spent making up all the prefabs. This process usually has three steps.</p>\n<p>First step: drinking coffee.</p>\n<p>Second step: coming up with basic shapes and paths. This I tend to do in batches, doodling in a notepad or on my tablet, sometimes at a cafe, on a train, or really anywhere that isn&rsquo;t my work desk (for a change).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image4.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>With enough of these basic shapes figured out in varying levels of detail, it&rsquo;s then time for-</p>\n<p>Third step: spend days in Tiled, creating first at first the basic layouts, then adding more aesthetic detail.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image5.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I usually alternate between doing all three of these critical steps - a few hours in Tiled, then going for a walk to clear my head, get a coffee, and come up with some more prefab ideas.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s this design process that to me really drives home how much the game is a Roguelike (or is at least related to them - ask two fans of roguelikes what makes something a roguelike and you will get five different answers).</p>\n<p>Just like designing most any other Rogue-adjacent game, it also means that staring at prefabs and their metadata until your eyes go square won&rsquo;t truly tell if what you&rsquo;ve built plays well. Great ideas on paper don&rsquo;t always work. Or maybe they do, but with a few powerups they become too easy (or too hard).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image6.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>In Tiled, shown above, we have data layers that exist along with aesthetic ones. Different data types (each a unique colour for easy recognition) can be painted on that layer to allow the prefab designer to, for instance, stop a player jumping onto that square, stop power-ups from randomly spawning there, or forcing a square to be non-passible.</p>\n<p>Which means built into this prefab design cycle is also a crap-ton of testing. From almost the very start we&rsquo;ve had regular QA and play-testing done at least a few hours a week. What puzzles are too hard when you&rsquo;re moving at speed? What other forms end up being fun and should be put into more prefabs?</p>\n<p>Even the simple act of adding more prefabs can unbalance the game if we aren&rsquo;t careful. Add 20 more prefabs to a given Land, and suddenly those rare ones you made might occur less frequently than you&rsquo;d like.</p>\n<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s meant that designing this game has been a massively cyclic process. Adding features, prefabs, or puzzles, tinkering with them, experimenting, and even removing some if they turn out to have been better left on that scrap of napkin at the cafe down the road from my place.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<p><em>Hi there!

At the end of each level you get a brief moment of respite at a camp where you can pick up and buy powerups, take or turn in quests, and go make another tea in the kitchen before returning to your computer before venturing ever-further into the fantastical worlds of Purgatory.</p>\n<p>At first glance, the game doesn&rsquo;t look like a Roguelike. Even in the most loose definition of the term - it&rsquo;s vertically scrolling and action-driven. If anything, it seems to have more in common with something like River Raid or 1942 than a dungeon crawler. But to me, where it starts to show its lineage is when it comes to do level design in the game.</p>\n<p>In terms of my work on the project, I&rsquo;m designing &amp; writing the game with Ron, but probably the majority of my time is spent doing the level design. As such, I felt like that was a good place to start when writing a guest blog post - I could focus on one of the only things I actually do more than Ron on the game.</p>\n<p>In the most superficial sense, the game&rsquo;s levels are top-down 2d level prefabs designed in <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a>, a very useful open-source tile-based map editor, and stitched together at run-time by the game.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image2.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The individual pieces (we refer to them as prefabs) each have different bits of meta data attached to them such as their Land (or biome), what kind of prefab they are, what other prefabs they can attach to and what the probability is that they might appear, what mobs can spawn, etc.</p>\n<p>For instance, a very simple, short bit of green grass with a small hill and some simple decorations might be pretty common, and appear regardless of what level you&rsquo;re at, where-as a more complex prefab featuring a maze may be rare, limited to higher levels only, and might be flagged to only appear once in a level.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image3.jpeg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Using this metadata we can set it up so that early levels are shorter, simpler, and contain fewer ‘puzzle’ prefabs (what we call the more complex prefabs that have optional mazes, gates or enemy ambushes in them).</p>\n<p>If a new player starts on the first level of a run (which is always in the grassy Land), the prefabs that get chosen to assemble the level are different to, say, the 15th level for a player who&rsquo;s unlocked lots of upgrades and is currently in the Swamp land.</p>\n<p>So, to create a single Land means designing the aesthetics, the enemies that occupy its levels, the basic gameplay style, and then, finally, a good hundred or more prefabs that make it up.</p>\n<p>Doing those first bits isn&rsquo;t easy, but it isn&rsquo;t as time consuming as the weeks and months spent making up all the prefabs. This process usually has three steps.</p>\n<p>First step: drinking coffee.</p>\n<p>Second step: coming up with basic shapes and paths. This I tend to do in batches, doodling in a notepad or on my tablet, sometimes at a cafe, on a train, or really anywhere that isn&rsquo;t my work desk (for a change).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image4.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>With enough of these basic shapes figured out in varying levels of detail, it&rsquo;s then time for-</p>\n<p>Third step: spend days in Tiled, creating first at first the basic layouts, then adding more aesthetic detail.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image5.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I usually alternate between doing all three of these critical steps - a few hours in Tiled, then going for a walk to clear my head, get a coffee, and come up with some more prefab ideas.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s this design process that to me really drives home how much the game is a Roguelike (or is at least related to them - ask two fans of roguelikes what makes something a roguelike and you will get five different answers).</p>\n<p>Just like designing most any other Rogue-adjacent game, it also means that staring at prefabs and their metadata until your eyes go square won&rsquo;t truly tell if what you&rsquo;ve built plays well. Great ideas on paper don&rsquo;t always work. Or maybe they do, but with a few powerups they become too easy (or too hard).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image6.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>In Tiled, shown above, we have data layers that exist along with aesthetic ones. Different data types (each a unique colour for easy recognition) can be painted on that layer to allow the prefab designer to, for instance, stop a player jumping onto that square, stop power-ups from randomly spawning there, or forcing a square to be non-passible.</p>\n<p>Which means built into this prefab design cycle is also a crap-ton of testing. From almost the very start we&rsquo;ve had regular QA and play-testing done at least a few hours a week. What puzzles are too hard when you&rsquo;re moving at speed? What other forms end up being fun and should be put into more prefabs?</p>\n<p>Even the simple act of adding more prefabs can unbalance the game if we aren&rsquo;t careful. Add 20 more prefabs to a given Land, and suddenly those rare ones you made might occur less frequently than you&rsquo;d like.</p>\n<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s meant that designing this game has been a massively cyclic process. Adding features, prefabs, or puzzles, tinkering with them, experimenting, and even removing some if they turn out to have been better left on that scrap of napkin at the cafe down the road from my place.</p>'}}

I could make it a lot smarter, but what I really need is tool that stress tests the game so smarts of low on the list.</p>\n<p>I can leave it running overnight and it plays thousands of levels and in the morning I see if any errors occurred or if there are memory leaks.</p>\n<p>None so far.</p>\n<p>Its been a great tool for consoles because we can only do limited testing before sending it to outside testers due to limited dev kits<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss#fn:1">1</a></sup>, so running TesterTron3000 on it for 24 hours is good piece of mind.</p>\n<p>There are little animation glitches because it&rsquo;s not running through the normal controller code and I&rsquo;ve spotted some missing sfx.</p>\n<p>TesterTron3000 is written 100% in Dinky and only about 100 lines of code.</p>\n<p>I might ship it with the final game as an attract mode, but it&rsquo;s kind of buggy, has bad path finding, and really stupid so I worry players would fixate on what it&rsquo;s not doing right.  It&rsquo;s not a tool for playing the game with any degree is skill, it&rsquo;s a stress tester and a dev tool.</p>\n<p>But, it&rsquo;s fun to watch.</p>\n<p>\u200f</p>\n\n    <div style="padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">\n      \n    </div>\n\n<p>\u200f</p>\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:1">\n<p>Something a lot of people don&rsquo;t know is for consoles you need special dev kits to test with, it&rsquo;s not like the PC (or even the SteamDeck) where you can use any device.

But more important is there is no human interaction, so there is less chance of a mistake being made.</p>\n<p>To upload to Steam you need to authenticate, which usually involves getting an email and typing in a code or doing the same with their authentication app. It&rsquo;s not very conducive to automated builds.</p>\n<p>Fortunately <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading#automating_steampipe">Steam has an process</a> where you authenticate once and then pass a token from the command line and that logs you in without a password. Wonderful.</p>\n<p>This worked fine for what seem like years, then on Jan 1, 2025 I got a error saying my token was expired. OK, makes some sense.</p>\n<p>I re-ran the process to get a new token and everything was fine for a day or so, then it failed again saying the token was expired. Then it happened again. And again.</p>\n<p>Frustrated, I reached out to the friend who works at Valve and was put in contact with a programmer there. He watched the back-end and said everything was fine for the first few auths and then the old expired token as submitted.  Rebuilding the token worked for a while and then the old token was submitted again.</p>\n<p>We began to suspect the token file on my machine was being overwritten but I couldn&rsquo;t see it happening and didn&rsquo;t know how it was happening.

(1) You have options on how to act and what to do after you acted, (2) these choices impact the game and future choices, both in the near future and far future; and (3) when playing for the first time I didn&rsquo;t feel like I had a choice, there was only thing my character would have done.</li>\n<li>I like sidequest with &ldquo;treasure hunt&rdquo; like the maps in Red Dead Redemption</li>\n<li>I like tiny quests about interpersonal relationships, like resolving a conflict between a mortician and his gravedigger employee in Ultima 6, or babysitting a dock worker&rsquo;s daughter in Citizen Sleeper.</li>\n<li>the Tarrey Town quest arc from Zelda Breath of the Wild is one of my all time favorites. It&rsquo;s really just a series of supply fetch quests and &ldquo;find yet another character whose name rhymes with &lsquo;son&rsquo; (in this big huge open world)&rdquo; but it <em>feels</em> like you are helping establish an entire new town in the wilderness - leaves you with a genuine &ldquo;I helped people&rdquo; feeling. After which it becomes a real town that is quite a useful outpost with lots of new quests it opens up in turn.</li>\n<li>I like quests where you have to run around between a few characters, doing small tasks for them or delivering messages between them to get them to work together eventually.\nLike with getting Olga and Boris to make up in Quest for Glory 4, or the Chinese hitmen quest in VtM: Bloodlines.</li>\n<li>quests that leave lasting impact on the game world (like rebuilding a village, changing the landscape, that sort of thing)</li>\n<li>one that comes to mind is having to sneakily follow someone to find out what they&rsquo;re up to without them noticing</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;ll have to come back to this, but I think scenarios are important. Why you are doing the quest isn&rsquo;t always as important as what you do during the quest.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m currently playing through Baldurs Gate 3 and in one instance i began fighting one group of enemies, only for another to show up that distracted them. Essentially you have to use this distraction effectively to win the fight because it collects the enemies in a group and the interjecting enemy eventually leaves. If you didn&rsquo;t do enough with it, you are left with an army of enemies.</li>\n<li>I also like murder mysteries. Locked in a house or something, talk to people, figure out who is the killer.</li>\n<li>There was another game where during a fight a fire is spreading, so you have to manage the fight while getting distance from the fire. If you move too quick the enemies are able to surround you, too slow or let someone get knocked down, the fire gets them.</li>\n<li>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s super important for a game to be incredibly hard or easy or whatever. I think the sweet spot for video games is &lsquo;hard enough that I need to pay attention, and no harder.&rsquo;</li>\n<li>different outcomes for people or places. For example, depending on your efficiency on solving the quest (or on decisions), you save a family or they get killed; or someone gets in debt with you and will help you later or he will hire killers to slay you; you may save a town from evil wizards or it may be cursed with fatal consequences</li>\n<li>I like quests with options. Say I need to get inside the castle. Is my only option stealth? Or could I bribe the guard, or seduce the guard, or distract the guard, or find an old tunnel from the monastery?</li>\n<li>Quests that do world building. I loved all the side quests in The Witcher 3 for example. They were all unique little stories in the Witcher universe, making the game more immersive as you played it.</li>\n<li>There was one in Neverwinter Nights with a glass sphere that contained a parallel world? And One in Dragon Age with a mouse hole. - Can´t remember exactly.Generally ones that are less predictable but logical to solve.</li>\n<li>I always liked questions where I brought NPCs back together or highly political strategic ones ;)</li>\n<li>I love it when quests are smaller pieces of bigger quests. For example in GTA when you do heists, a few missions set up the heist then you perform the actual heist which makes use of the earlier things you did.</li>\n<li>I love ones that involve mystery. The Dark Brotherhood questline in TES: Oblivion comes to mind. Specifically &ldquo;Whodunit&rdquo;, where you participate in a murder mystery party where you are the murderer.</li>\n<li>first thing that came to mind was the spell book in King&rsquo;s Quest 6. Travel around gathering ingredients (which didn&rsquo;t feel tedious as you needed to Island-hop for other story &amp; puzzle reasons) then cast spells that advance the story. Not all spells were required due to different ways to win the game.</li>\n<li>Helping a NPC gets you a pet/sidekick</li>\n<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloody_Baron">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloody_Baron</a></li>\n<li>may I chime in? I like quests which turn out to be something completely different than you expect, and where the good writing/setup makes you forget that its a scripted event. RPG or adventure, makes no difference. Most memorable quest: Warhead on Amiga, where you eatch Constrictor annihilate the entire Sirius fleet with single missile (while going la-de-da), and then you get mission from your headquarters to go and attack it</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m fine with them being tiny impacts on the world. if I&rsquo;m fetching an hat for the person, the person wears it after. If I fetch an item for a shopkeeper, it increases stock</li>\n<li>If there&rsquo;s a side quest where I need to make medicine because someone is sick, I need to do it immediately</li>\n<li>The quests where we need to make choices (maybe moral ones) with consequences hard to predict. Hag quest in Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3 is one of my favourite quests, for example.</li>\n<li>Legend of Mana, the lamp selling quest: <a href="https://mana.fandom.com/wiki/Lumina_(location)#Faeries\'_Light">https://mana.fandom.com/wiki/Lumina_(location)#Faeries&rsquo;_Light</a> You had to learn the Dudbears&rsquo; language and answer their questions. <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/256525-legend-of-mana/faqs/7963">https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/25652</a></li>\n<li>I like the help korok to reach his friend in Tears of the Kingdom. (Although many seem to prefer to torture them) Most of it because of the sound. The koroks really sound sad and distressed but when you put them together you hear the sound of relief. &ldquo;Helping them&rdquo; is a good theme by itself but the sound really adds to the feeling and role play.</li>\n<li>I like quest for adding new team members That was old chaps from the original once</li>\n<li>quests that affect the ending for sure, even if it&rsquo;s an extra sprite in the lineup. It blew my child mind they you can save Luca&rsquo;s mom from losing her legs in Chrono Trigger and it affected that particular line of endings (game has over a dozen). It&rsquo;s a thing you end up having to do regardless, a little action sequence, but it&rsquo;s hard enough to not telegraph in any way that it&rsquo;s actually possible to win and save your mom. Like it seems as if you&rsquo;re supposed to simply relive trauma.</li>\n<li>i like the ones that get initiated by the player - technically, it&rsquo;s you who just walked up to a random person and tried to ask what&rsquo;s up.</li>\n<li>one I did yesterday while playing Mario rpg. The quest triggers when you arrive in a town and you meet a trio of characters that tell you they hid something around the world, and they give you clues like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s genuine a wooden flower&rdquo; or &ldquo;under a green bed&rdquo;. You have to revisit and find these things. I liked it, solving the clues made me feel smart, and the places I revisited felt deeper now.</li>\n<li>The &ldquo;small favor&rdquo; ones, where you start with a very simple task but it slowly unfurls into an endless quest.</li>\n<li>I really like the quests that seem simple at first but reveal a lot of world behind them. Like, the initial quest is &ldquo;get me some widgets&rdquo; but you start looking into why there&rsquo;s a widget shortage and you discover the frobnicator is down due to sabotage because there are warring factions of frobnicator builders and their disagreements are deep-seated, sensible, and not trivially solvable. Then the wish fulfillment part is that you solve them.</li>\n<li>The ones where, just when you have everything ready to turn in for a reward, you suddenly get new information casting doubt on whether you should do so, and have to make a choice about which side to take. It&rsquo;s that moment of player agency right after a stretch of non-agency, doing stuff because someone else told you to.</li>\n<li>I like quests where you&rsquo;ve been manipulated to side with someone. You do their quest, and then they destroy the town, kill the king, release the kraken etc..setting you up for quests to undo what you did.</li>\n<li>The ones that stick with me involve making choices that seem unconnected until later (e.g. the treatment of specific monsters in Witcher 3 affecting the fates of characters you may or may not meet) or that build connections with people and places (like how completing a fetch quest or taking care of a problem aids in reconstructing a colony in Xenoblade Chronicles).</li>\n<li>Mass Effect 2 - been a while but I recall caring enough about the party members that doing their personal quests seemed like an intrinsically motivated thing to do. Basically either give me a good enough motivation to do the quest, or keep the downside/extra effort low. And please don&rsquo;t try to abuse my FOMO.</li>\n<li>Witcher 3 - Practicum quest. Funny, and builds  NPC character (which they don&rsquo;t do much with after). I also enjoy the simpler contracts as &ldquo;go there, kill huge thing&rdquo; fits the game.</li>\n<li>The hunted hotel from Vampire Bloodlines is one quest I will always remember. Not because is a brilliant quest, but because the twist of the mood of the game. Suddenly, I&rsquo;m in a horror game and still it uses the mechanics from the general game. I love that quest.</li>\n<li>I just did a quest* in GuildWars2 where I collected bits of a renowned family&rsquo;s tapestry from all over the world, starting in the previous big expac. Like the Snargle Goldclaw achievements (look him up), I liked how this connected to the changing world of the story, but on the fringes. It connected to NPCs I&rsquo;d heard arguing about mass-producing artisan blankets now that borders were open and&hellip;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;signs of the sojourner&rdquo; has beautifully done quests. there&rsquo;s an overarching quest to learn about your mom, and progress comes naturally through conversation games (the game&rsquo;s main mechanic). you receive additional tasks, like to bring back vinegar or a musical instrument, and if you don&rsquo;t complete these, the outcome of your game is changed. then there are fetch quests for individual characters and exit ramps through certain characters. it&rsquo;s very artfully put together, to me.</li>\n<li>Some memorable quests: In &ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Dogma,&rdquo; breaking into the Duke&rsquo;s castle to rescue a princess. Also, stealing a ring for the Duke, forging it, giving him the forgery, and using the original to rob him dry.</li>\n<li>Anything which has a lasting effect on the Gameworld. Megaton in Fallout 3 being an easy example.</li>\n<li>The Purification quest in Oblivion at the end of the Dark Brotherhood questline, when you have to kill al the NPCs of the brotherhood you have been getting quests from and interacting with. It felt so weird.</li>\n</ul>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<p>I recently asked on <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@grumpygamer">Mastodon</a> about favorite quests.

I am getting something from RtMI but it&rsquo;s small. I&rsquo;ve created a lot over the years and only made other people rich.</p>\n<p>I support the game industry unionizing, not only to create reasonable working hours, but also to stop companies from getting rich off our hard creative work. I don&rsquo;t think game writers should be part of the WGA, the businesses are too different, and I&rsquo;ve seen the cluster fuck of Hollywood unions trying to get into games.</p>\n<p>Unions can also be their own oppressive mess but it&rsquo;s probably slightly better than what we have now. I do worry about how rigid unions would hamper true indie game work.</p>'}}

We talked over ideas we&rsquo;d had over the years including one of mine where Guybrush wakes up 3000 years in the future on a snowball Earth.</p>\n<p>We talked about my original &ldquo;hell&rdquo; idea but other Monkey Island games had already done much of that (by pure coincidence) and there was little point in rehashing it.</p>\n<p>The one thing I wanted to do was start the new game right where LeChuck&rsquo;s Revenge ended, and that became the one unmovable stone.</p>\n<p>I have made one pixel art game in my entire career and that was Thimbleweed Park.  Monkey Island 1 and 2 weren&rsquo;t pixel art games. They were games using state-of-the-art tech and art. Monkey Island 1 was 16 color EGA and we jumped at the chance to upgrade it to 256 colors.  Monkey Island 2 featured the magical wizardry of scanned art by Peter Chan and Steve Purcell and we lusted to keep pushing everything forward.</p>\n<p>If I had stayed and done Monkey Island 3 it wouldn&rsquo;t have looked like Monkey Island 2. We would have kept pushing forward, and Day of the Tentacle is a good example of that.</p>\n<p>I never liked the art in DotT.  Technically and artistically it was fantastic, but I never liked the wacky Chuck Jones style.  But that was Dave and Tim&rsquo;s game, not mine. They can do what they want and I completely supported that.</p>\n<p>Curse of Monkey Island also took a leap forward. It introduced us to a fully voiced and taller, lankier Guybrush with painted backgrounds that were all the rage in the late 90s.  It was very much a game of its time.</p>\n<p>When Dave and I first started brainstorming Return to Monkey Island we talked about pixel art, but it didn&rsquo;t feel right. We didn&rsquo;t want to make a retro game. You can&rsquo;t read an article about Thimbleweed Park without it being called a &ldquo;throwback game&rdquo;.  I didn&rsquo;t want Return to Monkey Island to be just a throwback game, I wanted to keep moving Monkey Island forward because it&rsquo;s interesting, fun, and exciting. It&rsquo;s what the Monkey Island games have always done.</p>\n<p>I wanted the art in Return to Monkey Island to be provocative, shocking, and not what everyone was expecting.  Rex is an amazing creative force and we have a team of incredible artists, animators, sound designers, programmers, and testers all pouring their souls into this game and it&rsquo;s beautiful to see, play, and listen to.</p>\n<p>The music Michael, Peter, and Clint are doing is equally amazing.  It&rsquo;s not AdLib, Sound Blaster, or even Roland MT-32 music. Its stunning, interactive, and recorded live.</p>\n<p>Return to Monkey Island may not be the art style you wanted or were expecting but it&rsquo;s the art style I wanted.</p>\n<p>When I started this game my biggest fear was Disney wouldn&rsquo;t let me make the game I wanted to make but they have been wonderful to work with.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that the people who don&rsquo;t want me to make the game I want to make are some of the hard core Monkey Island fans. And that is what makes me sad about all the comments.</p>\n<p>Return to Monkey Island is an incredible rollercoaster.  Get on and have some fun or stomp out of the amusement park because it&rsquo;s not exactly the rollercoaster you wanted.</p>\n<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll jump on with the rest of us.</p>\n<p><a href="https://grumpygamer.com/if_i_made_another_monkeyisland">*Seventeen</a> - The game would be the game I wanted to make. I don&rsquo;t want the pressure of trying to make the game you want me to make. I would vanish for long periods of time. I would not constantly keep you up-to-date or be feeding the hype-machine.

It was very much a game of its time.</p>\n<p>When Dave and I first started brainstorming Return to Monkey Island we talked about pixel art, but it didn&rsquo;t feel right. We didn&rsquo;t want to make a retro game. You can&rsquo;t read an article about Thimbleweed Park without it being called a &ldquo;throwback game&rdquo;.  I didn&rsquo;t want Return to Monkey Island to be just a throwback game, I wanted to keep moving Monkey Island forward because it&rsquo;s interesting, fun, and exciting. It&rsquo;s what the Monkey Island games have always done.</p>\n<p>I wanted the art in Return to Monkey Island to be provocative, shocking, and not what everyone was expecting.  Rex is an amazing creative force and we have a team of incredible artists, animators, sound designers, programmers, and testers all pouring their souls into this game and it&rsquo;s beautiful to see, play, and listen to.</p>\n<p>The music Michael, Peter, and Clint are doing is equally amazing.  It&rsquo;s not AdLib, Sound Blaster, or even Roland MT-32 music. Its stunning, interactive, and recorded live.</p>\n<p>Return to Monkey Island may not be the art style you wanted or were expecting but it&rsquo;s the art style I wanted.</p>\n<p>When I started this game my biggest fear was Disney wouldn&rsquo;t let me make the game I wanted to make but they have been wonderful to work with.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that the people who don&rsquo;t want me to make the game I want to make are some of the hard core Monkey Island fans. And that is what makes me sad about all the comments.</p>\n<p>Return to Monkey Island is an incredible rollercoaster.  Get on and have some fun or stomp out of the amusement park because it&rsquo;s not exactly the rollercoaster you wanted.</p>\n<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll jump on with the rest of us.</p>\n<p><a href="https://grumpygamer.com/if_i_made_another_monkeyisland">*Seventeen</a> - The game would be the game I wanted to make. I don&rsquo;t want the pressure of trying to make the game you want me to make. I would vanish for long periods of time. I would not constantly keep you up-to-date or be feeding the hype-machine. I&rsquo;d show stuff that excited me or amused me. If you let me do those things, you will love the game. That, I promise.</p>'}}

Is it so hard to send an email?</p>\n<p>My $160 Apple Airpods stopped connecting to my Mac. The error: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Connect&rdquo;. Ok, so why! How about a little information! It&rsquo;s due to arrogance.  Apple products &ldquo;just work&rdquo; so there is no need for an error message.</p>\n<p>For months now iPhotos won&rsquo;t download new photos from the Photosteam? Why? No error. No information. I used to be able to click a button and import photos directly from the phone&hellip; that is now gone? Why? Because Apple products &ldquo;just work&rdquo;.  Dear Apple: You suck at the cloud.</p>\n<p>My next phone won&rsquo;t be a iPhone.</p>\n<p>Apple has locked down the Mac is such hamfisted way that it&rsquo;s getting hard to be a developer (let alone a user) on the Mac.  Admit that your heart was in the right place but you botched the implementation of the sandbox and come up with some that protects people and also respects us.  Ben Franklin&rsquo;s quote works for operating systems just as well: &ldquo;Those who desire to give up freedom in order to gain security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m really getting tried of Apple apologists who are basically the MAGA/Fox News equivalents for Apple. Any criticism is quickly countered with praise or excuses. Any critique of Apple is followed with awe over some new product. Apple is never going to fix #1 if you keep praising #2. Why would they?</p>\n<p>Please explain to me why the wealthiest company in the world still has the same open bugs year after year after year.  Hire some more programmers&hellip; it&rsquo;s not rocket science.</p>\n<p>My day-to-day home use as moved to Linux&hellip; but Linux is also a mess.  Why isn&rsquo;t there a good high quality IDE for C++ on Linux? I&rsquo;ve tried them all&hellip; WTF.  Just be as good as Xcode or VS (it&rsquo;s not a high bar).</p>\n<p>This might be good time to give up on computers.  Cabin in the woods, scruffy beard, flannel shirt.  Bonus points if my new best friend is a grizzly bear.</p>\n<p>P.S. I promise my next post will be about Lego. That is assuming Lego doesn&rsquo;t add DRM&hellip; you know&hellip; for my protection</p>'}}

The frustration reached a boiling point last week when for no reason the Windows build started generating compile errors in <code>stdlib</code> headers. I reverted back to the last build that compiled but the errors continued.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve got to assume something changed in the Azure Windows VM, but there was no mention of it.  Maybe it was just a temp glitch.</p>\n<p>I decided the time was right to get the game building on <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> if for nothing more than just having a backup.</p>\n<p>AppVeyor has some (how to I say this kindly) horrific documentation.</p>\n<p>It took me a day to cobble together snippets posted by others on the world wide web but it&rsquo;s finally working (now I just need to get Linux compiling).</p>\n<p>The good news is AppVeyor builds both platforms in around 5 mins (running 2 parallel jobs like Azure was).</p>\n<p>Big win over Azure.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is the Mac builds twice as fast as Windows.  I don&rsquo;t know if this is a Visual Studio vs. XCode thing or just the VMs they are running on.</p>\n<p>I thought I&rsquo;d post my <code>appveyor.yml</code> so others can benefit from my pain. I couldn&rsquo;t get <code>$(configuration)</code> (and the like) to work, so I ended by hand pasting values like <code>Release</code>.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a AppVeyor expert, I&rsquo;m open to suggests on making it better.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-yaml"><span style="display: flex;"><span><span style="color: #f92672;">version</span>: <span style="color: #ae81ff;">1.0</span><span style="color: #ae81ff;">.{build}</span>\n</span></span><span style="display: flex;"><span><span style="color: #f92672;">image</span>: \n</span></span><span style="display: flex;"><span>  -

OK, fine.</p>\n<p><code>local image = createTextImage(FONT_SYSTEM, &quot;Hello World&quot;, 48)</code></p>\n<p>There is a fairly high degree of technical and programming knowledge needed. I&rsquo;ve always skewed away from visual programming and dialogue engines. While they are great for beginners, getting real work done is problematic. Again, these are the real tools we used, not watered down &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; tools.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Git for 10+ years, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever had a public repo and had to deal with pull requests, etc. This will be a big learning curve for both of us.</p>\n<p>I generally won&rsquo;t be accepting pull requests just for modifications to the game unless they fix bugs related to getting this repo working. I might accept pull requests for documentation and new translations and if they are good they maybe-might be integrated into the shipping game.</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;But Ron, why won&rsquo;t you accept my bug fixes and improvements to the game?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Good question little Timmy&hellip; let&rsquo;s dive into that&hellip;</p>\n<p>A game that goes on Steam, Epic, or GOG requires a great deal of testing. Delores had/has two full-time paid testers and before any build was uploaded to a store, it got a good deal of testing around the fix, plus a complete play through of 30 photos was required on each platform. Each of the stores uses the same &ldquo;bits&rdquo;, but we still had to download each platform from each store and do a run through.</p>\n<p>And that was for an easy fix. If the fix was more involved or changed logic significantly it could require 20-40 hours of testing. If we broke a store build, it would be hours of tech support emails.</p>\n<p>I believe a lot in testing and testers and much of that came from my time at Lucasfilm and dealing with hard media. To even put a build of Monkey Island into test required over an hour of work as I made and verified 5+ floppies. Just rebuilding the SCUMM scripts to Monkey Island took over an hour (a job that takes a fraction of a second for Delores).</p>\n<p>Releasing a build going to manufacture was nerve wracking and very expensive. If you introduced a stupid bug, you&rsquo;d remake 200,000 floppies. While Monkey Island was in final testing, any change had to live in test for two weeks. If we found a bug and made a new build, we&rsquo;d reset the clock.</p>\n<p>Today it&rsquo;s easy. I start a shell script, wait 15 minutes for the CI machine to build the new engines and 5 seconds later it&rsquo;s on Steam and I can push the &ldquo;publish&rdquo; button. It&rsquo;s too easy.</p>\n<p>BONUS NOTE: Don&rsquo;t believe the myth that programmers can test their own code. They can&rsquo;t. Programmers will test for all the conditions they can imagine, but a good tester will imagine many many more and players will try things programmers never even considered. Knowledge of their code is the achilles heel of programmers. I&rsquo;ve had code I was 100% sure was rock solid, only to have one of our testers reduce me to tears. A good tester excels at poking your code in places you never considered. I&rsquo;m not talking about your unit tested sort routine, I&rsquo;m talking about complex puzzle logic and odd UI uses. It&rsquo;s the stuff unit tests will never catch, but a good tester will. Testers are the unsung heroes of your team, treat them very well.</p>\n<p>Every time you do a build, you also run the risk of accidentally introducing an error. Once I did a build from the wrong branch, everything looked fine but after a few bugs came in, I realized something was very wrong. I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t just build and hit &ldquo;publish&rdquo;. Even fixing a typo requires testing.</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Hey Ron, little Timmy again&hellip; why don&rsquo;t you release the source to the engine?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Another great question.</p>\n<p>Releasing the engine source (c++) is problematic for a few reasons. The first is that it uses a very large library of mine, most of which is not used in this engine, so I&rsquo;d have to go though and cull out all the cruft, not to mention all the proprietary console crap.  I also use some third party source I don&rsquo;t have the rights to release.  It&rsquo;s a big job and would split my main engine off from the released engine, which becomes a merge catastrophe (either that or a million #if&rsquo;s).</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Little Timmy again, I have a followup question&hellip; Why don&rsquo;t you license the executable for us to use in our shipping games?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Allowing others to release games using the engine is a support nightmare for me.   A game would be released and then customers would have issues, or it wouldn&rsquo;t work on specific hardware, and then I&rsquo;d be stuck (indirectly) supporting it.  I could charge money, but unless hundreds (if not thousands) of people licensed the engine, I fear the cost would be more than a game is likely to make.</p>\n<p>But the most important reason is that I like to make games and want to dedicate most of my time to making new ones, not supporting an engine.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve had a chance to look at all the source, I think you&rsquo;ll realize there is no &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; here.  It&rsquo;s just an adventure game engine. Why did I create a new one? Because I enjoy it.</p>\n<p>This post ended up being longer than I expected.  I hope you enjoy looking through my and David&rsquo;s crappy code. Happy modding.  I&rsquo;m excited to see what you do.</p>\n<p>(wait for laughter from todd)</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, the Delores source is intended solely for personal use to learn and explore. Please respect our choice to release the source by using it as intended.</p>\n<p>P.S. The dev engine has all the same limitations as the game, so Mac 10.10, Win 10 (dx12) and unfortunately (at this time) no Linux build. As soon as the Linux version is done, I will upload that as well. It might be a month, or months, or longer.</p>\n<p>P.P.S If you have questions or want to help others out, visit <a href="https://forums.thimbleweedpark.com/c/delores-engine/18">the Thimbleweed Park Forums</a></p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<p>Oh crap!</p>\n<p>I accidentally pushed the wrong button and made the <a href="https://github.com/grumpygamer/DeloresDev">Delores source code available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>I guess there is no putting Delores back in the bottle now&hellip;</p>\n<p>(wait for laughter)</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m only half kidding.</p>\n<p>(wait for Todd in the third row, who laughs at anything, to stop laughing)</p>\n<p>I did publish all the <a href="https://github.com/grumpygamer/DeloresDev">source code to Delores on GitHub</a>, but it wasn&rsquo;t an accident.

Again, these are the real tools we used, not watered down &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; tools.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Git for 10+ years, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever had a public repo and had to deal with pull requests, etc. This will be a big learning curve for both of us.</p>\n<p>I generally won&rsquo;t be accepting pull requests just for modifications to the game unless they fix bugs related to getting this repo working. I might accept pull requests for documentation and new translations and if they are good they maybe-might be integrated into the shipping game.</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;But Ron, why won&rsquo;t you accept my bug fixes and improvements to the game?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Good question little Timmy&hellip; let&rsquo;s dive into that&hellip;</p>\n<p>A game that goes on Steam, Epic, or GOG requires a great deal of testing. Delores had/has two full-time paid testers and before any build was uploaded to a store, it got a good deal of testing around the fix, plus a complete play through of 30 photos was required on each platform. Each of the stores uses the same &ldquo;bits&rdquo;, but we still had to download each platform from each store and do a run through.</p>\n<p>And that was for an easy fix. If the fix was more involved or changed logic significantly it could require 20-40 hours of testing. If we broke a store build, it would be hours of tech support emails.</p>\n<p>I believe a lot in testing and testers and much of that came from my time at Lucasfilm and dealing with hard media. To even put a build of Monkey Island into test required over an hour of work as I made and verified 5+ floppies. Just rebuilding the SCUMM scripts to Monkey Island took over an hour (a job that takes a fraction of a second for Delores).</p>\n<p>Releasing a build going to manufacture was nerve wracking and very expensive. If you introduced a stupid bug, you&rsquo;d remake 200,000 floppies. While Monkey Island was in final testing, any change had to live in test for two weeks. If we found a bug and made a new build, we&rsquo;d reset the clock.</p>\n<p>Today it&rsquo;s easy. I start a shell script, wait 15 minutes for the CI machine to build the new engines and 5 seconds later it&rsquo;s on Steam and I can push the &ldquo;publish&rdquo; button. It&rsquo;s too easy.</p>\n<p>BONUS NOTE: Don&rsquo;t believe the myth that programmers can test their own code. They can&rsquo;t. Programmers will test for all the conditions they can imagine, but a good tester will imagine many many more and players will try things programmers never even considered. Knowledge of their code is the achilles heel of programmers. I&rsquo;ve had code I was 100% sure was rock solid, only to have one of our testers reduce me to tears. A good tester excels at poking your code in places you never considered. I&rsquo;m not talking about your unit tested sort routine, I&rsquo;m talking about complex puzzle logic and odd UI uses. It&rsquo;s the stuff unit tests will never catch, but a good tester will. Testers are the unsung heroes of your team, treat them very well.</p>\n<p>Every time you do a build, you also run the risk of accidentally introducing an error. Once I did a build from the wrong branch, everything looked fine but after a few bugs came in, I realized something was very wrong. I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t just build and hit &ldquo;publish&rdquo;. Even fixing a typo requires testing.</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Hey Ron, little Timmy again&hellip; why don&rsquo;t you release the source to the engine?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Another great question.</p>\n<p>Releasing the engine source (c++) is problematic for a few reasons. The first is that it uses a very large library of mine, most of which is not used in this engine, so I&rsquo;d have to go though and cull out all the cruft, not to mention all the proprietary console crap.  I also use some third party source I don&rsquo;t have the rights to release.  It&rsquo;s a big job and would split my main engine off from the released engine, which becomes a merge catastrophe (either that or a million #if&rsquo;s).</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Little Timmy again, I have a followup question&hellip; Why don&rsquo;t you license the executable for us to use in our shipping games?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Allowing others to release games using the engine is a support nightmare for me.   A game would be released and then customers would have issues, or it wouldn&rsquo;t work on specific hardware, and then I&rsquo;d be stuck (indirectly) supporting it.  I could charge money, but unless hundreds (if not thousands) of people licensed the engine, I fear the cost would be more than a game is likely to make.</p>\n<p>But the most important reason is that I like to make games and want to dedicate most of my time to making new ones, not supporting an engine.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve had a chance to look at all the source, I think you&rsquo;ll realize there is no &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; here.  It&rsquo;s just an adventure game engine. Why did I create a new one? Because I enjoy it.</p>\n<p>This post ended up being longer than I expected.  I hope you enjoy looking through my and David&rsquo;s crappy code. Happy modding.  I&rsquo;m excited to see what you do.</p>\n<p>(wait for laughter from todd)</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, the Delores source is intended solely for personal use to learn and explore. Please respect our choice to release the source by using it as intended.</p>\n<p>P.S. The dev engine has all the same limitations as the game, so Mac 10.10, Win 10 (dx12) and unfortunately (at this time) no Linux build. As soon as the Linux version is done, I will upload that as well. It might be a month, or months, or longer.</p>\n<p>P.P.S If you have questions or want to help others out, visit <a href="https://forums.thimbleweedpark.com/c/delores-engine/18">the Thimbleweed Park Forums</a></p>'}}

That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing this blog entry.</p>\n<p>When the Thimbleweed Park engine got to the point where it could actually be used and David was brought on, I thought about CI. Previously I had used a dedicated machine in the office with <a href="https://jenkins.io/index.html">Jenkins</a> installed.  I only ever needed to make a Windows build (or builds that used VS) so it was one machine with a few different flavors of builds.</p>\n<p>For Thimbleweed Park I need to make Windows, Xbox, Mac, Android, IOS (and later Switch and PS4) and Linux builds.

As the end of the project rolled around it seemed pointless since the project was almost over.  Of course, I was wrong and we continued doing updates and ports for a year.</p>\n<p>At the time I was looking at CI, cloud-based services like <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a> either didn&rsquo;t exist or never showed up on Google searches.  Today you can just use these two cloud services to build Windows (or anything that needs VS), Mac (Mac and iOS) and Linux. Android can be built on any of them. If you don&rsquo;t mind waiting 10 or 15 minutes for the build to start, both services are very reasonable (and free for open source projects).</p>\n<p>In the end, I built the Windows, Mac and Linux builds on my local machine. I had the entire process scripted, so it was running a single bash script and all the Mac versions were built.  I ran a Windows VM on my Mac and would launch it was run a .bat file to built all the Windows flavors.   Same with Linux, boot the VM and do the builds.</p>\n<p>Thimbleweed Park was a tad complex because there were two parts that had to be rebuilt (the engine and the game), and while intertwined, they were separate and it was common for one to be rebuilt and the other not.  It was also complicated by all the game build tools being on the Mac, so you couldn&rsquo;t actually build the game code on Windows. This didn&rsquo;t matter since the game code/files were 100% cross-platform. I could build them on the Mac and they would run on Windows, PS4, Switch, etc.</p>\n<p>It makes CI a little more complex because your CI might be building the engine but something had to merge it all together (another CI process).  The game code needs to be built first (and you don&rsquo;t need to rebuild it for each platform), then the engine process could grab it and merge it, or a third process could combine it all, but everyone would have to know when each piece was done (if a new build was needed). My point isn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s impossible, just that it&rsquo;s hard and a problem that I ultimately (and unfortunately) didn&rsquo;t need to solve.</p>\n<p>Back when the project started, if I had known about <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a>, I would have set them up and ultimately saved me a lot of time and stress.</p>\n<p>Next time for sure!!!</p>\n<p>No, really, next time for sure.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ci.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Last month (maybe longer) I wrote about one of the top three production mistakes we made in Thimbleweed Park.

I ran a Windows VM on my Mac and would launch it was run a .bat file to built all the Windows flavors.   Same with Linux, boot the VM and do the builds.</p>\n<p>Thimbleweed Park was a tad complex because there were two parts that had to be rebuilt (the engine and the game), and while intertwined, they were separate and it was common for one to be rebuilt and the other not.  It was also complicated by all the game build tools being on the Mac, so you couldn&rsquo;t actually build the game code on Windows. This didn&rsquo;t matter since the game code/files were 100% cross-platform. I could build them on the Mac and they would run on Windows, PS4, Switch, etc.</p>\n<p>It makes CI a little more complex because your CI might be building the engine but something had to merge it all together (another CI process).  The game code needs to be built first (and you don&rsquo;t need to rebuild it for each platform), then the engine process could grab it and merge it, or a third process could combine it all, but everyone would have to know when each piece was done (if a new build was needed). My point isn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s impossible, just that it&rsquo;s hard and a problem that I ultimately (and unfortunately) didn&rsquo;t need to solve.</p>\n<p>Back when the project started, if I had known about <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a>, I would have set them up and ultimately saved me a lot of time and stress.</p>\n<p>Next time for sure!!!</p>\n<p>No, really, next time for sure.</p>'}}

How you divide your time between making games and living &ldquo;real life&rdquo; ?</strong></p>\n<p>I work on a Mac exclusively. When I need to compile a Windows or Linux build, I start up a VM. I can&rsquo;t listen to music while I program, I need complete quiet. When I write, music is helpful. Dividing my life between making games and real life is a struggle. I need to leave the house to fully disconnect. In the winters, I go skiing. I&rsquo;m off skiing today.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Giorgio Novelli: Why did you leave Lucasfilm? I never found a satisfying answer on the internet and it still kind of haunts and confuses me.</strong></p>\n<p>I had worked at Lucasfilm for 8 years and learned a lot, not just about game design and programming, but also marketing, PR, and production and I felt like I needed to try it all for myself. I also had the idea of making adventure games for kids. I floated it by Lucasfilm Games and they weren&rsquo;t interested. It feels like the confusing thing for a lot of people about me leaving comes from them thinking I was leaving an amazingly successful franchise and why would I do that? That&rsquo;s because, at the time, Monkey Island wasn&rsquo;t. It sold well, but not amazingly well. Sierra Online was selling 10x the copies we were and it&rsquo;s was only 20 years later that Monkey Island has taken on this almost mythic nature in people&rsquo;s memories. That wasn&rsquo;t true back then.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>** PiecesOfKate: Considering the potential benefits of social media (such as Twitter) for promoting a game, versus your personal dislike of those channels - if you were to make another game would you rejoin, or avoid it?

If I was just releasing a new game, I don&rsquo;t think I would need to come back, but if I was doing a Kickstarter, it would be really hard to not leverage social media.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Gustavo: Hi Ron. I have always wondered about the &ldquo;Extra 5 USD for Guilt Absolution&rdquo; tier on the Kickstarter campaign that I and 3047 other people choose. Where did that idea come from? Did you expect to have so many people voluntarily choose to pay 5 USD more than the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; tier?</strong></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t remember who came up with this, but we knew it was going to be popular, and if not popular, then funny.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Nathan: Given the engine and assets of TWP, would a sequel be significantly cheaper / quicker to produce?</strong></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think it would. The engine didn&rsquo;t add that much to the development time and cost. Maybe 20%, but saving 20% isn&rsquo;t significant and that savings would get eaten up in engine enhancements and me wanting to do more artistically with the presentation. Holding true to the spirit of Maniac Mansion (dollhouse view, no close-ups or cinematic presentation (think about the difference between Maniac Mansion and DotT)) saved us a lot. We could make a new game cheaper if it had the same look and feel, but that isn&rsquo;t creatively interesting for me. If I do another point-and-click, I want to push what a point-and-click can be, but still staying true to the form.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>LostTrainDude: Where do you think improvement and evolution lie in the future of adventure games, considering their heavily-scripted nature? Is it in technology or in better design? What is it that you would like to see in an adventure game and didn&rsquo;t yet? This discussion rises from my curiosity in Chris Crawford&rsquo;s work on Interactive Storytelling (which you may be familiar with as well).</strong></p>\n<p>The future of interactive narrative is in true AI. I don&rsquo;t think AI will ever be able to tell compelling stories on its own (stories are compelling because they are soulful depictions of the human experience), but there is so much &ldquo;filling&rdquo; that goes on in an interactive story that AI would be perfect for.

The whole story is about it&rsquo;s medium and just telling you about it (in novel form) removes you from the whole point. I&rsquo;m fine with fan fiction and long as it stays &ldquo;fan&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not so much about making money as not turning it into an industry. There is a lot of Thimbleweed Park fan art (and even people selling it), and I don&rsquo;t have a problem as long as 1) You can&rsquo;t use our trademarks, 2) it&rsquo;s not confused with official/licensed merchandise, 3) you&rsquo;re not making too much.

Thimbleweed Park was probably the better for it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Erik: Would you consider going back in the direction of Humongous Entertainment by creating games that are solely aimed at kids rather than &ldquo;grown ups&rdquo;? Do you ever think about that segment of games?</strong></p>\n<p>The kids market has changed a lot in the last 15 years and I don&rsquo;t find it interesting anymore. It&rsquo;s all about licensed games, quick disposable mobile games, or these odd social website type games. What I loved about making games at Humongous Entertainment was telling stories as adventure games. I don&rsquo;t think there is a big market for that anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Dryade: If you never manage to make Monkey Island 3, which would be a tragedy, will you divulge the secret of Monkey Island or will it just vanish with you and keep us all forever in anguish?</strong></p>\n<p>Here is the deal with the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of Monkey Island: It&rsquo;s just not that interesting now (it was back then). But over the last 25 years, it&rsquo;s grown to almost mythic proportions. If I told you the secret, you&rsquo;d go &ldquo;Oh&hellip; that&rsquo;s kind of dumb&rdquo;. If I was ever to do Monkey Island 3a, the trick would be to take the core of the secret and build it into something that lived up to the hype. I would never create a new or different secret (that&rsquo;s unfair), rather, it would be about making it more meaningful, relevant, and build on the mythology. I have an idea on how to do that, but it&rsquo;s not fully formed and sorry to disappoint everyone, but I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time thinking about it these days.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lancelot&rsquo;s Hangover: After beta testing, what do you do if you realize a series of puzzles doesn&rsquo;t work. Do you cut off the whole series of the puzzles (meaning wasting time/art/effort)?  Do you try to make those puzzles easier by giving more explicit hints through dialogs and hotspot/object descriptions? Do you keep most art and animations but rebuild the whole series of puzzle in a different way?</strong></p>\n<p>I assume you mean &ldquo;playtesting&rdquo; since we don&rsquo;t do beta testing.  But, at any point in development, from playtesters, bug testers, or us playing the game, we&rsquo;re constantly finding puzzles that don&rsquo;t work. That&rsquo;s a normal part of the design process. Most of the time it&rsquo;s a simple tweak like adding or changing a line of dialog or moving a clue. Other times we&rsquo;ve had to take the entire puzzle chain and move it to a different part of the game (we did this with the Pigeons in Thimbleweed Park) and this can involve doing new art or animation. There are other times where the core of the puzzle just doesn&rsquo;t work, so you just cut it and never look back. Ideally, your production process is such that most of this happens when you&rsquo;re still in a pre-production and making large changes doesn&rsquo;t cost that much, but occasionally, you&rsquo;re making big puzzle edits late in the process and you just take the hit. I&rsquo;d rather throw out good work than leave it in and diminish the experience.

I might do a bonus post on Wednesday answering some of the ones I couldn&rsquo;t get to, and of course, there is next week to eagerly look forward to.  Let&rsquo;s get going&hellip;</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with Octavi. I wonder where I know that name from?</p>\n<p><strong>Octavi: When making any kind of artistic work we know there&rsquo;s always a disappointingly huge difference between our first idea and the end result: which one of your games you&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the most faithful to your original vision?</strong></p>\n<p>None of them.  I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before, but the creative process is a messy process and everything I&rsquo;ve done has changed significantly from idea to finished game. I can&rsquo;t think of an idea that ended up being something horribly distorted from my original idea (or maybe I just blocked it out). I don&rsquo;t tend to work with publishers, so I&rsquo;ve never had a 3rd party come in and take my idea in a direction I disagreed with. The important lesson for anyone making something is: don&rsquo;t be afraid to let your idea evolve during production, even radically. There is no prize for stubbornly sticking to your vision.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Romulus: When deciding on 2D vs 3D was money the only factor? We all know 3D sucks eh? Also, how you decided what were the components required on the engine? Based on your previous scumm experience?</strong></p>\n<p>To start off, I don&rsquo;t dislike 3D, it&rsquo;s just not something I have the skill set to do at a reasonable level of quality.  3D is more expensive, but it&rsquo;s not massively more expensive if you make good tech and artistic choices. I&rsquo;d love to make a true point-and-click adventure in real 3D (not that fake 2D/3D). I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s done it well yet, and it would be a fascinating challenge.  But my tech skills are in 2D, so I would need to partner up with someone who had good 3D chops. The problem is finding that person. They need to share a vision and passion with me and not just be a work-for-hire gig.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Jensan: Could you see yourself coding a C64 game from scratch in 2018? If so, what type of game?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh god no! Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love the C64, but I&rsquo;m too used to modern tools and platforms. Only 2G of free RAM! WTF!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Kim Jørgensen: What was the best and worst design decision for TWP?</strong></p>\n<p>Best: Having a hard and easy mode. When I did it for Monkey Island 2, it was more of a joke than anything else, but in today&rsquo;s more casual/grown-up world, I think it was greatly appreciated by a lot of players with less time than they had as kids.</p>\n<p>Worst: I wish we would have had custom responses for every verb and object in the first few rooms of the game. Players were just getting used to the interface and mechanic and default responses threw people off sometimes. We couldn&rsquo;t realistically do this for the entire game, but we could have done a better job of setting the mood without misleading expectations.</p>\n<p>Bonus: Not shipping with a hint system. We fixed this in an update, but it should have been part of the release. I fought against it for most of the project, and I was wrong.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Yrface: If you were to punish a visitor for unauthorized copyright infringement of your website, how/who would administer the punishment?</strong></p>\n<p>Me. Human dismemberment is a hobby of mine.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Jon N/A: Hey Ron. There used to be posts here - &ldquo;excerpts&rdquo; from a novel you have <em>not</em> been writing. I loved those! I found them hilarious and very inventive. Would you put them back up again? And better yet, write more of those?</strong></p>\n<p>Those were part of a daily writing exercise I used to do in the mornings. I would sit down with a pad and paper and just start writing, never pausing and never thinking about any direction.  I&rsquo;d then go through and grab a sentence or two that I liked. I stopped doing the writing exercise and they never got moved to Grumpy Gamer v2.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll go find them and do a single anthology post.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Paul: What is Ron Gilbert&rsquo;s ultimate goal in the gaming industry? Eg: To make a big popular game and then be able to make whatever you want off the back of it? Continually make great games for a loyal smaller audience (eg. PnC fans) within budget and with reasonably healthy profit on each? Branch out and make games in different genres? Build Terrible Toybox further and make it a main game studio? Put out artistic games that push boundaries, but don&rsquo;t necessarily find a large audience?</strong></p>\n<p>Holy crap is this is a deep minefield of a question. Why do we do what we do? Doing any commercial creative venture is done for one of five reasons. 1) To make money, 2) Critical acclaim, 3) Peer approval, 4) Personal fulfillment, 5) Player enjoyment (or any combination of those). At a core level, why do I make games? If I was going to be honest, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s 4, 5 and 3, but I need 1 due to not being independently wealthy. Thimbleweed Park did 4 and 5, didn&rsquo;t really do 3 and did 1, but only at a breakeven level.  You can&rsquo;t run a risky business like making games at breakeven. No matter how good you are, you will have failures and you need to make enough to endure those without destroying the company and yourself. Part of 3 is making something that your peers and the industry take notice of, something that &ldquo;moves the meter&rdquo;.  Doing point-and-click adventures at breakeven doesn&rsquo;t do that, and I think that&rsquo;s always been a motivator of mine. This is an honest answer that it&rsquo;s easy to read too much into, so don&rsquo;t do that.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>uriel: From what I read is my understanding that Thimbleweed Park sold fine but it was not a resounding success. Do you think a bigger marketing campaign would have increased revenue to the point of making enough money to fully fund the next game? I guess I&rsquo;m wondering how much do you think marketing can influence the success of a game. Thanks for doing this btw.</strong></p>\n<p>I think it&rsquo;s fairer to say Thimbleweed Park &ldquo;sold well&rdquo;. I had a range of what I thought would be acceptable and sales were towards the bottom, but not below. I don&rsquo;t think more marketing would have helped. We had good (even great) PR and we got picked up by all the major publications, so I don&rsquo;t know if there was anything more we could have done. I think there were three core issues with Thimbleweed Park:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Point-and-click has a huge stigma attached to it and I vastly underestimated that. I figured that if you designed a really good point-and-click game, people would respond. And that is partly true. For the people who took the plunge and played it, they were pleasantly (and often overwhelmingly) surprised. But, too many other people (and a fair number of industry people) just wrote it off.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Influencers (press and widely known devs) in the industry are craving deep, meaningful and grown-up narrative games, and they will latch onto games that even hint at that, even if they do a crappy job at it. Thimbleweed Park is not that game. Thimbleweed Park is the best Scooby Doo story you&rsquo;ve ever played and doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be a deep soul searching reflection for the player.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We struggled with what was needed to do a successful Kickstarter and what&rsquo;s needed to release a successful game.  Doing the Maniac Mansion art style and layout was key to invoking the right nostalgia and ending with a highly successful Kickstarter, but some of those choices also limited its &ldquo;market success&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m very proud that we delivered on what we promised for the Kickstarter. We talked about dropping the verbs and dropping the dollhouse Maniac Mansion layout but ultimately decided not to in favor of being true to the campaign. In the end, maybe we made the wrong &ldquo;business&rdquo; decision, but I feel we made the right &ldquo;personal creative&rdquo; decision and I don&rsquo;t regret it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Or&hellip; maybe we didn&rsquo;t make a very compelling and interesting game. You always have to consider that.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Sushi Will we ever see a Terrible Toybox logo? If not, why not. If so, when? If maybe, just improvise something funny.</strong></p>\n<p>Not knowing if this would be a one-game company (still not sure about that), we decided to focus all our branding on Thimbleweed Park and not Terrible Toybox.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lancelot&rsquo;s Hangover: Hey Ron! In the TWP podcasts, you talked about the importance of the &ldquo;sense of space&rdquo; in adventure games and its importance for immersion. Could you tell more about it? Could you give practical details on how you can add more sense of space within games? Could be useful for adventure game designers.</strong></p>\n<p>The number one rule for creating a sense of space is: Don&rsquo;t teleport the player around. Let people explore the world and create an internal map of the space in their head.  Even something like &ldquo;fast travel&rdquo; can destroy a sense of place. Don&rsquo;t jump players inside a building without letting them discover the outside and where it exists in the world. In Thimbleweed Park, you had to walk/run around the world for a good ¼ of the game before we introduced fast-travel with the maps. Often players will just want to jump around the world, avoiding &ldquo;pointless travel&rdquo;, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s pointless. It&rsquo;s an important part of that sense of space that makes the world and game more enjoyable.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Antony: How do you justify the lack of support of Android on your game Scurvy Scallywags while complaining about the lack of macOS support on Steam games?</strong></p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a fair question and I assume it&rsquo;s in <a href="https://grumpygamer.com/1728dad57df92e42389a28c">response to this.</a> I think it&rsquo;s different for a couple of reasons and I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people&rsquo;s perspectives will be different. I didn&rsquo;t mean to criticize other indie devs, I know building multiple platforms is hard. To me, Mac and Windows are 99% the same. Building for Mac after Window just isn&rsquo;t that hard, just don&rsquo;t litter your code with dx calls. Also, maybe I&rsquo;ve gotten spoiled due to Unity projects being super simple to release on Mac, so we&rsquo;re seeing a lot more of them. Also, we did build Scurvy for Android. It was a complete flop and made a few thousand dollars, despite costing us tens of thousands of dollars. Google changed some part of the OS and the game started crashing, so we removed it from the store. It just wasn&rsquo;t worth the time to go in an fix it given it was making around a dollar a week. iOS, on the other hand, continued to make money and porting up to iOS 11 made sense. I also think (as Mac user), there is a bigger sting due to Steam being a single store that sells Windows and Mac platforms.  If there was a Windows store and a completely separate Mac store (like iOS and Android), I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have the same negative feelings. In the end, it probably was a little unfair to the devs of Cogmind, but I just really wanted to play their game. But point taken.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it for this week. If you have any questions for next week, put them in the comments. I&rsquo;ll try and answer different types of questions each week so they aren&rsquo;t all questions about Thimbleweed Park or my old games. If you ask a question for next week, please start it with Q: so I can quickly filter them.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/friday_questions_c.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of good questions this week, I&rsquo;ll chock that up to being the first week.

I also think (as Mac user), there is a bigger sting due to Steam being a single store that sells Windows and Mac platforms.  If there was a Windows store and a completely separate Mac store (like iOS and Android), I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have the same negative feelings. In the end, it probably was a little unfair to the devs of Cogmind, but I just really wanted to play their game. But point taken.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it for this week. If you have any questions for next week, put them in the comments. I&rsquo;ll try and answer different types of questions each week so they aren&rsquo;t all questions about Thimbleweed Park or my old games. If you ask a question for next week, please start it with Q: so I can quickly filter them.</p>'}}

We had a problem on the PS4 where savegame data would get corrupt due to threading. We could have built a stress tester for this, but that&rsquo;s all 20/20 hindsight. I can think of 100 other places that worked fine and without that hindsight, we would have spent a lot of time writing stress testers.</p>\n<p>Again, not impossible, just not economical.</p>\n<p>But maybe I&rsquo;m wrong. Maybe other game developers have amazing game unit tests that are enormous time and money savers. If that&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;d love to hear about them. I&rsquo;m basically lazy and more than happy for robots to do my work.</p>\n<p>But it feels like the ability to unit test games would require a good AI that can spot perceptual issues that go way beyond just getting bad data out of a function. Or maybe that&rsquo;s called Early Access.</p>'}}

Moon bases and rocket ships. It didn&rsquo;t quite turn out the way 8-year-old Ronnie imagined. Some ways better. Some ways worse. I&rsquo;m not sure my life turned out the way I imagined. Some ways better some. Some ways worse.</p>\n<p>2017 was the year Thimbleweed Park came out. It was also the year a dipshit narcissistic asshole became president.  I would gladly trade Thimbleweed Park for a mentally stable president. And so should you.</p>\n<p>But enough reminiscing and fostering armed rebellion&hellip; it&rsquo;s on to 2018.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never been the kind of person that does New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions. Like 99% of all people, I just forget about them a month later and have now decided to be honest with myself and stop making them.  So let&rsquo;s call these &ldquo;goals&rdquo; for 2018. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that these are just my professional and career goals. My personal goals are another whole can of worms that I won&rsquo;t be sharing on the damn internet.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get going&hellip;</p>\n<h3 id="play-more-games"><strong>Play more games</strong></h3>\n<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t say enough about this one. I hardly play any video games. 2016-2017 were busy years for me, but deep down I know that is just an excuse. At the end of the workday, I&rsquo;m burnt out and I just don&rsquo;t want to play games, they always feel more like work than relaxation. It&rsquo;s also really hard for me to play a game without deconstructing it and that saps a lot of the enjoyment away.</p>\n<p>I did play Golf Story for many many hours until rage quitting (more on that in a future post).  I quite enjoyed West of Loathing as well (no rage quitting). But besides a few mobile games to waste some time, I didn&rsquo;t really play anything else.</p>\n<p>I hear from friends about all the games they played and I wonder &ldquo;where do you find all the time?&rdquo;  Well, all that is going to change in 2018, and now that my blog is fully operational, I hope to write about what I&rsquo;m playing. And I promise not to just bitch about them.</p>\n<p>Then again&hellip; maybe I don&rsquo;t enjoy playing games. That&rsquo;s a terrifying thought.</p>\n<h3 id="do-a-twitch-steam"><strong>Do a Twitch steam</strong></h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do this. I doubt it will be a gameplay stream, I am way too quiet when playing games. When I watch Streamers, I marvel at how they can talk non-stop while playing. When I play games, I get very quiet and contemplative. I don&rsquo;t tend to &ldquo;think out loud.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What I&rsquo;d like to do is a programming Stream. I joked about adding floppy disk sounds to Thimbleweed Park when it&rsquo;s loading data, so my goal is to stream me implementing that.  Streaming from a Mac is a little harder, but I&rsquo;m sure I can figure it out.</p>\n<h3 id="give-a-talk"><strong>Give a talk</strong></h3>\n<p>I really hate giving talks. It&rsquo;s not stage fright, it&rsquo;s more that I over prepare and end up spending months writing the talk and stressing about it. It&rsquo;s just not a good use of my time, so I tend to avoid it.</p>\n<p>Also, when most people ask me to talk, it usually about Monkey Island or some retro topic. I really don&rsquo;t want to only be known as &ldquo;the guy that created Monkey Island and made point-and-click games&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s all anyone wants to hear me talk about. It would depress me greatly if that was actually the truth.</p>\n<p>So my 2018 goal is to give a talk about a non-monkey-island-point-and-click topic. I have a talk in my head called <strong>&ldquo;10 things I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</strong>  I think I&rsquo;ll give that one. Or maybe <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not imposter syndrome, you actually suck at your job.&rdquo;</strong> Then there is &ldquo;<strong>Don&rsquo;t get cocky kid, it&rsquo;s mostly luck</strong>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I refuse to give a talk about Thimbleweed Park unless it&rsquo;s <strong>&ldquo;Everything we fucked up in Thimbleweed Park.&rdquo;</strong> I&rsquo;m sick and tired of survivor bias talks. GDC is filled with them.</p>\n<p>OK, fine, this is why people only ask me to talk about Monkey Island.</p>\n<h3 id="blog-often-and-stay-off-twitter"><strong>Blog often and stay off Twitter</strong></h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been over a month since I&rsquo;ve been on Twitter and it&rsquo;s been great. I highly recommend it.  Like shedding any addiction, the first few weeks are hard, then it gets harder, then it gets better. Getting the Grumpy Gamer blog back up and running has been very therapeutic.</p>\n<p>Being able to write about something in other than 140 (now 280) character angry shouts has been nice and I plan on doing a lot more long-form writing in 2018. Currently, hardly anyone comes here, so it might take some time to build back an audience and convince the kids that the entire internet isn&rsquo;t just Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</p>\n<p>Please pass the word and share any good posts.  I might end up writing a Twitter bot that just posts links to my blog when it updates (that will reach a hell of a lot more people than RSS).</p>\n<h3 id="start-working-on-a-game"><strong>Start working on a game</strong></h3>\n<p>To be clear, my goal in 2018 is to start working on a game that will eventually ship. I am working on fun/relaxing prototypes that are helping to solidify various ideas in my head, but I doubt any of them will ever be finished. Thimbleweed Park was a huge grind and it&rsquo;s going to take me a while to come down from that.</p>\n<p>This new game doesn&rsquo;t have to be my own game. Finding a small group in Seattle that could use my talents would also be fun. Working with other people in the same physical location would be a gust of fresh air.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d Kickstart a new game either. Kickstarter was fun, but it&rsquo;s also feeding the hype/narcissism train like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It almost demands it and one could say that it&rsquo;s good for promotion, and that&rsquo;s hard to argue with, but it can make you do crazy/stupid/unproductive things.

They reached their full potential during Monkey Island where I relied on them for every aspect of the puzzle design.</p>\n<p>A Puzzle Dependency Chart is a list of all the puzzles and steps for solving a puzzle in an adventure game. They are presented in the form of a Graph with each node connecting to the puzzle or puzzle steps that are need to get there.  They do not generally include story beats unless they are critical to solving a puzzle.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s build one!</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_1.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I always work backwards when designing an adventure game, not from the very end of the game, but from the end of puzzle chains.  I usually start with &ldquo;The player needs to get into the basement&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Where should I hide a key to get into some place I haven&rsquo;t figured out yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I also like to work from left to right, other people like going top to bottom. My rational for left to right is I like to put them up on my office wall, wrapping the room with the game design.</p>\n<p>So&hellip; first, we&rsquo;ll need figure out what you need to get into the basement&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_2.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>And we then draw a line connecting the two, showing the dependency. &ldquo;Unlocking the door&rdquo; is dependent on &ldquo;Finding the Key&rdquo;.  Again, it&rsquo;s not flow, it&rsquo;s dependency.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s add a new step to the puzzle called &ldquo;Oil Hinges&rdquo; on the door and it can happen in parallel to the &ldquo;Finding the Key&rdquo; puzzle&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_3.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>We add two new puzzle nodes, one for the action &ldquo;Oil Hinges&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s dependency &ldquo;Find Oil Can&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Unlocking&rdquo; the door is not dependent on &ldquo;Oiling&rdquo; the hinges, so there is no connection. They do connect into &ldquo;Opening&rdquo; the basement door since they both need to be done.</p>\n<p>At this point, the chart is starting to get interesting and is showing us something important: The non-linearity of the design. There are two puzzles the player can be working on while trying to get the basement door open.</p>\n<p>There is nothing (NOTHING!) worse than linear adventure games and these charts are a quick visual way to see where the design gets too linear or too unwieldy with choice (also bad).</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s build it back a little more&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_6.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>When you step back and look at a finished Puzzle Dependency Chart, you should this kind of overall pattern with a lot of little sub-diamond shaped expansion and contraction of puzzles.  Solving one puzzle should open up 2 or 3 new ones, and then those collapses down (but not necessarily at the same rate) to a single solution that then opens up more non-linear puzzles.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_7.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The game starts out with a simple choice, then the puzzles begin to expand out with more and more for the player to be doing in parallel, then collapse back in.</p>\n<p>I tend to design adventures games in &ldquo;acts&rdquo;, where each act ends with a bottle neck to the next act. I like doing this because it gives players a sense of completion, and they can also file a bunch of knowledge away and (if need) the inventory can be culled).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_5.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Monkey Island would have looked something like this&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_4.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have the Puzzle Dependency Chart for Monkey Island, or I&rsquo;d post it. I&rsquo;ve seen some online, but they are more &ldquo;flowcharts&rdquo; and not &ldquo;dependency charts&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve had countless arguments with people over the differences and how dependency charts are not flowcharts, bla bla bla. They&rsquo;re not. I don&rsquo;t completely know why, but they are different.</p>\n<p>Flowcharts are great if you&rsquo;re trying to solve a game, dependency charts are great if you&rsquo;re trying to design a game. That&rsquo;s the best I can come up with.</p>\n<p>Here is a page from my MI design notebook that shows a puzzle in the process of being created using Puzzle Dependency Charts. It&rsquo;s the only way I know how to design an adventure game. I&rsquo;d be lost without them.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/MI2_puzzle1_small.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, how do you make these charts?</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need some software that automatically rebuilds the charts as you connect nodes. If you try and make these using a flowchart program, you&rsquo;ll spend forever reordering the boxes and making sure lines don&rsquo;t cross. It&rsquo;s a frustrating and time consuming process and it gets in the way of using these as a quick tool for design.</p>\n<p>Back at Lucasfilm Games, we used some software meant for project scheduling. I don&rsquo;t remember the name of it, and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s long gone.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve only modern program that does this well is <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">OmniGraffle</a>, but it only runs on the Mac. I&rsquo;m sure there are others, but since OmniGraffle does exactly what I need, I haven&rsquo;t look much deeper. I&rsquo;m sure there are others.</p>\n<p>OmniGraffle is built on top of the unix tool called <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a>. Graphviz is great, but you have to feed everything in as a text file. It&rsquo;s a nerd level 8 program, but it&rsquo;s what I used for DeathSpank.</p>\n<p>You can take a look at the <a href="https://grumpygamer.com/deathspank_pdc_image">DeathSpank Puzzle Dependency Chart here</a>, but I warn you, it&rsquo;s a big image, so get ready to zoom-n-scroll™.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this was interesting.

They do not generally include story beats unless they are critical to solving a puzzle.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s build one!</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_1.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I always work backwards when designing an adventure game, not from the very end of the game, but from the end of puzzle chains.  I usually start with &ldquo;The player needs to get into the basement&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Where should I hide a key to get into some place I haven&rsquo;t figured out yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I also like to work from left to right, other people like going top to bottom. My rational for left to right is I like to put them up on my office wall, wrapping the room with the game design.</p>\n<p>So&hellip; first, we&rsquo;ll need figure out what you need to get into the basement&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_2.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>And we then draw a line connecting the two, showing the dependency. &ldquo;Unlocking the door&rdquo; is dependent on &ldquo;Finding the Key&rdquo;.  Again, it&rsquo;s not flow, it&rsquo;s dependency.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s add a new step to the puzzle called &ldquo;Oil Hinges&rdquo; on the door and it can happen in parallel to the &ldquo;Finding the Key&rdquo; puzzle&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_3.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>We add two new puzzle nodes, one for the action &ldquo;Oil Hinges&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s dependency &ldquo;Find Oil Can&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Unlocking&rdquo; the door is not dependent on &ldquo;Oiling&rdquo; the hinges, so there is no connection. They do connect into &ldquo;Opening&rdquo; the basement door since they both need to be done.</p>\n<p>At this point, the chart is starting to get interesting and is showing us something important: The non-linearity of the design. There are two puzzles the player can be working on while trying to get the basement door open.</p>\n<p>There is nothing (NOTHING!) worse than linear adventure games and these charts are a quick visual way to see where the design gets too linear or too unwieldy with choice (also bad).</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s build it back a little more&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_6.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>When you step back and look at a finished Puzzle Dependency Chart, you should this kind of overall pattern with a lot of little sub-diamond shaped expansion and contraction of puzzles.  Solving one puzzle should open up 2 or 3 new ones, and then those collapses down (but not necessarily at the same rate) to a single solution that then opens up more non-linear puzzles.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_7.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The game starts out with a simple choice, then the puzzles begin to expand out with more and more for the player to be doing in parallel, then collapse back in.</p>\n<p>I tend to design adventures games in &ldquo;acts&rdquo;, where each act ends with a bottle neck to the next act. I like doing this because it gives players a sense of completion, and they can also file a bunch of knowledge away and (if need) the inventory can be culled).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_5.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Monkey Island would have looked something like this&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_4.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have the Puzzle Dependency Chart for Monkey Island, or I&rsquo;d post it. I&rsquo;ve seen some online, but they are more &ldquo;flowcharts&rdquo; and not &ldquo;dependency charts&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve had countless arguments with people over the differences and how dependency charts are not flowcharts, bla bla bla. They&rsquo;re not. I don&rsquo;t completely know why, but they are different.</p>\n<p>Flowcharts are great if you&rsquo;re trying to solve a game, dependency charts are great if you&rsquo;re trying to design a game. That&rsquo;s the best I can come up with.</p>\n<p>Here is a page from my MI design notebook that shows a puzzle in the process of being created using Puzzle Dependency Charts. It&rsquo;s the only way I know how to design an adventure game. I&rsquo;d be lost without them.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/MI2_puzzle1_small.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, how do you make these charts?</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need some software that automatically rebuilds the charts as you connect nodes. If you try and make these using a flowchart program, you&rsquo;ll spend forever reordering the boxes and making sure lines don&rsquo;t cross. It&rsquo;s a frustrating and time consuming process and it gets in the way of using these as a quick tool for design.</p>\n<p>Back at Lucasfilm Games, we used some software meant for project scheduling. I don&rsquo;t remember the name of it, and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s long gone.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve only modern program that does this well is <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">OmniGraffle</a>, but it only runs on the Mac. I&rsquo;m sure there are others, but since OmniGraffle does exactly what I need, I haven&rsquo;t look much deeper. I&rsquo;m sure there are others.</p>\n<p>OmniGraffle is built on top of the unix tool called <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a>. Graphviz is great, but you have to feed everything in as a text file. It&rsquo;s a nerd level 8 program, but it&rsquo;s what I used for DeathSpank.</p>\n<p>You can take a look at the <a href="https://grumpygamer.com/deathspank_pdc_image">DeathSpank Puzzle Dependency Chart here</a>, but I warn you, it&rsquo;s a big image, so get ready to zoom-n-scroll™.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this was interesting. I could spend all day long talking about Puzzle Dependency Charts. Yea, I&rsquo;m a lot of fun on a first date.</p>'}}

I hear devs who call themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo; roll their eyes at other devs who call themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo; because they &ldquo;clearly they aren&rsquo;t indie&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>So what makes an indie developer &ldquo;indie&rdquo;?  Let&rsquo;s look at the word.</p>\n<p>The word &ldquo;indie&rdquo; comes from (I assume) the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  I guess the first question we have to ask is: independent from what? I think most people would say &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Yet, I know of several devs who proudly call themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo; when they are taking money from publishers (and big publishers at that) and other devs that would sneer at a dev taking publisher money and calling themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>What about taking money from investors? If you take money are you not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? What about money from friends or family? Or does it have to be VCs for you to lose &ldquo;indie&rdquo; status?</p>\n<p>What about Kickstarter?  I guess it&rsquo;s OK for indies to take money from Kickstarter. But are you really &ldquo;independent&rdquo;?  3,000 backers who now feel a sense of entitlement might disagree. Devs who feel an intense sense of pressure from backers might also disagree.</p>\n<p>Does being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; mean your idea is independent from mainstream thinking? Is being an &ldquo;indie developer&rdquo; just the new Punk Rock.</p>\n<p>Does the type of game you&rsquo;re making define you as &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? If a dev is making a metrics driven F2P game, but they are doing it independent of a publisher, does that mean they are not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;?</p>\n<p>This is one of the biggest areas I see &ldquo;indie&rdquo; snobbery kick in.  Snobby &ldquo;indie&rdquo; devs will look at an idea and proclaim it &ldquo;not indie&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Do &ldquo;indie&rdquo; games have to be quirky and weird? Do &ldquo;indie&rdquo; games have to be about the &ldquo;art&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>What about the dev? Does that matter? Someone once told me I was not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; because I have an established name, despite the fact that the games I&rsquo;m currently working on have taken no money from investors or publishers and are made by three people.</p>\n<p>What if the game is hugely successful and makes a ton of money? Does that make it not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; anymore? Is being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; about being scrappy and clawing your way from nothing? Once you have success, are you no longer &ldquo;indie&rdquo;?  Is it like being an &ldquo;indie band&rdquo; where once they gain success, they are looked down on by the fans? Does success mean selling-out? Does selling-out revoke your &ldquo;indie dev&rdquo; card?</p>\n<p>What if the &ldquo;indie&rdquo; developer already has lots of money? Does having millions of dollars make them not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? What if they made the money before they went &ldquo;indie&rdquo; or even before they started making games or if they have a rich (dead) aunt? Does &ldquo;indie&rdquo; mean you have to starve?</p>\n<p>Is it OK for an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; to hire top notch marketing and PR people? Or do &ldquo;indies&rdquo; have to scrape everything together themselves and use the grassroot network?</p>\n<p>Or does &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just mean you&rsquo;re not owned by a publisher? How big of a publisher? It&rsquo;s easy to be a publisher these days, most indies who put their games up on Steam are &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;. The definition of a publisher is that you&rsquo;re publishing the game and the goal of a lot of studios is to &ldquo;self-publish&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Or does being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just mean you came up with the idea?  The Cave was funded and published by SEGA, so was it an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; title? SEGA didn&rsquo;t come up with the idea and exerted no creative control, so does that make it an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; title?</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answers to any of these questions (and maybe there aren&rsquo;t any), but it irritates me that some devs (or fans) look down on devs because they are not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; or not &ldquo;indie enough&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Or is being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just another marketing term? Maybe that&rsquo;s all it means anymore.

Let&rsquo;s look at the word.</p>\n<p>The word &ldquo;indie&rdquo; comes from (I assume) the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  I guess the first question we have to ask is: independent from what? I think most people would say &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Yet, I know of several devs who proudly call themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo; when they are taking money from publishers (and big publishers at that) and other devs that would sneer at a dev taking publisher money and calling themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>What about taking money from investors? If you take money are you not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? What about money from friends or family? Or does it have to be VCs for you to lose &ldquo;indie&rdquo; status?</p>\n<p>What about Kickstarter?  I guess it&rsquo;s OK for indies to take money from Kickstarter. But are you really &ldquo;independent&rdquo;?  3,000 backers who now feel a sense of entitlement might disagree. Devs who feel an intense sense of pressure from backers might also disagree.</p>\n<p>Does being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; mean your idea is independent from mainstream thinking? Is being an &ldquo;indie developer&rdquo; just the new Punk Rock.</p>\n<p>Does the type of game you&rsquo;re making define you as &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? If a dev is making a metrics driven F2P game, but they are doing it independent of a publisher, does that mean they are not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;?</p>\n<p>This is one of the biggest areas I see &ldquo;indie&rdquo; snobbery kick in.  Snobby &ldquo;indie&rdquo; devs will look at an idea and proclaim it &ldquo;not indie&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Do &ldquo;indie&rdquo; games have to be quirky and weird? Do &ldquo;indie&rdquo; games have to be about the &ldquo;art&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>What about the dev? Does that matter? Someone once told me I was not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; because I have an established name, despite the fact that the games I&rsquo;m currently working on have taken no money from investors or publishers and are made by three people.</p>\n<p>What if the game is hugely successful and makes a ton of money? Does that make it not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; anymore? Is being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; about being scrappy and clawing your way from nothing? Once you have success, are you no longer &ldquo;indie&rdquo;?  Is it like being an &ldquo;indie band&rdquo; where once they gain success, they are looked down on by the fans? Does success mean selling-out? Does selling-out revoke your &ldquo;indie dev&rdquo; card?</p>\n<p>What if the &ldquo;indie&rdquo; developer already has lots of money? Does having millions of dollars make them not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? What if they made the money before they went &ldquo;indie&rdquo; or even before they started making games or if they have a rich (dead) aunt? Does &ldquo;indie&rdquo; mean you have to starve?</p>\n<p>Is it OK for an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; to hire top notch marketing and PR people? Or do &ldquo;indies&rdquo; have to scrape everything together themselves and use the grassroot network?</p>\n<p>Or does &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just mean you&rsquo;re not owned by a publisher? How big of a publisher? It&rsquo;s easy to be a publisher these days, most indies who put their games up on Steam are &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;. The definition of a publisher is that you&rsquo;re publishing the game and the goal of a lot of studios is to &ldquo;self-publish&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Or does being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just mean you came up with the idea?  The Cave was funded and published by SEGA, so was it an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; title? SEGA didn&rsquo;t come up with the idea and exerted no creative control, so does that make it an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; title?</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answers to any of these questions (and maybe there aren&rsquo;t any), but it irritates me that some devs (or fans) look down on devs because they are not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; or not &ldquo;indie enough&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Or is being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just another marketing term? Maybe that&rsquo;s all it means anymore. It&rsquo;s just part of the PR plan.</p>'}}

They changed the name a year or so before I left when they rolled a bunch of divisions into this new company called LucasArts and the games group was one of them.  Many years later, all that was left in LucasArts was the old games group, so the name became synonymous with games.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me not to be sad. I haven&rsquo;t worked there since 1992, but it was still home to me. I grew up there. I learned just about everything I know about designing games there.  I became a real programmer there.

I&rsquo;m so good at it people actually send me death threats.  If you have a secret, you can tell me.  I won&rsquo;t tell anyone.  Go ahead.  I&rsquo;m listening.</p>\n<p>Over the past few months, I&rsquo;ve been the vessel for a couple of very exciting secrets and it&rsquo;s been really hard to not give someone the nudge-nudge-wink-wink-don&rsquo;t-tell-anyone, but I couldn&rsquo;t.  Not these.</p>\n<p>The first is the <a href="http://www.monkeyislandspecialedition.com">re-release of The Secret of Monkey Island</a>.  Several months ago I was invited to LucasArts to get a sneak preview.  Very cool.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will open up the pure pleasure that is Monkey Island to a whole new generation of gamer that  knows only how to use a console controller.</p>\n<p>The second secret is that <a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/monkeyisland">TellTale is doing an episodic version of Monkey Island</a>.  I had the great pleasure of spending a few days with Dave Grossman, Mike Stemmle and the rest of the TellTale crew getting my head into Guybrush Threepwood again.</p>\n<p>I am very exited for both of these games.  It&rsquo;s strange and humbling to see something you created 20 years ago take on a life of it&rsquo;s own.</p>\n<p>This next year is going to be very interesting.  Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer all have games coming out.  Someone check the scriptures.  Might be a good time to start hoarding canned goods.</p>\n<p>About a year and a little more ago, as I began designing the <a href="http://deathspank.com">uber-awesome DeathSpank</a>, I played all the way through The Secret of Monkey Island to refresh myself on the puzzles and dialog.</p>\n<p>I know this will come as a shock to many of you, but I don&rsquo;t spend my evenings playing through Monkey Island.  It&rsquo;s probably been 15 years since I sat down and really played it.</p>\n<p>Much like the experience of watching the <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/maniac_mansion_speed_run">Maniac Mansion Speed Run</a>, it bought back a lot of memories and little tid-bits of facts, so I started keeping notes and in celebration of all things Monkey Island, I thought I&rsquo;d share them.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, a couple of points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Some of this I&rsquo;ve written about before, so I apologize if I&rsquo;m wasting your time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I was playing the VGA version that was released after the original EGA version.  The original original version used 16 colors and the inventory was text only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These are only &ldquo;some-what&rdquo; in order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may disagree with me on some of these, and that&rsquo;s perfectly OK.  My life is forever intertwined with this game and some of these are more reflective than anything else.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 20 years.  My brain is full.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If anyone has specific questions about Monkey Island 1 or 2, feel free to ask them in the comments or <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/contact">send them to me</a>.  If the answer contain interesting information or fuels a good story, I&rsquo;ll add it to this list.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-14.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Someone please turn off the lights, and I&rsquo;ll start the projector.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-1a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The very small &ldquo;hot spot&rdquo; areas are very annoying today but they were accepted back then; they were even considered a good thing.  It&rsquo;s called Game Play!  It would be hard to make an adventure game today where players were forced to hunt for small objects.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-3a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Most people know you can hit the period key to skip a single line of dialog, but I&rsquo;m surprised when I run into people that don&rsquo;t know why I chose the period key.  It seems obvious to me: a period ends a sentence.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-4a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>While Insult Sword Fighting is one of the first things people think of when they hear Monkey Island, I thought it seemed little tedious (but fun) as I played though it again.  There is a point where you say &ldquo;I get it&rdquo;, but your still forced to go though the motions again and again.  If I was going to do Insult Sword Fighting in a future game, I&rsquo;d make it more free form allowing the player to be clever and construct their own sentences.</p>\n<p>During the early stages of the Monkey Island design, we would watch old Errol Flynn era pirate movies.  One thing that stood out was during the fights they always taunted each other with insults.  I knew we needed to have sword fighting in the game - it was about pirates after all - but I didn&rsquo;t want to introduce any action game play and the old pirate moves provided the perfect solution.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-12.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the late 80&rsquo;s, the mere thought of a scroll wheel on a mouse would have been crazy talk, but today I found it hard to break the habit of trying the scroll the inventory with it.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-8a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>You only have to follow the shop keeper to the Sword Master once, after that it&rsquo;s just automatic.  That was a good design choice.  No point in having to solve the same puzzle over and over.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-11a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Scene behind the walls of the governors mansion seemed a little long.  The original plan was to have real game play and puzzles, but the game was feeling too big and we need to cut stuff.  This gag was perfect, and in some ways better then making the player solve more puzzles.  Never be afraid to edit you game down if it needs it.  It will often be better for it.  Except this went on too long.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-28.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ahoy there, Fancy Pants&rdquo; is my favorite throw-away line ever.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-5a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Back then, the randomly generated forest was cutting edge technology.  Disk space was at a premium.  Everything had to fit on 5 floppy disks.  Sierra would ship games on 8 or 10 floppy disks. That was always a sore point for us.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-1b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I like the way you meet Otis, Sword Master and Meathook during regular puzzles, then hire them later.  Builds a sense of friendship before they are needed.  They aren&rsquo;t just three random people you meet for the first time while look for a crew.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-2b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The circus tent could have been more utilized.  Bit of a waste for one puzzle and the Fettucini Brothers didn&rsquo;t add much to the story.  That said, this was one of the first screens (&ldquo;rooms&rdquo; as we called them) where we used the SCUMM system&rsquo;s exclusive scrolling screens for dramatic effect.  Tim was the programmer on this room and he spent a lot of time getting it to scroll at just the right time to revel the tent.   I also like that the dialog choices are shown up up-side-down after Guybrush is shot from the cannon.  Doing that pushed the SCUMM system to utilize multiple fonts.  We didn&rsquo;t have that feature before this gag required it.  Guybrush being shot out of the canon was also foreshadowing for later when he needed to be shot out of the canon.  OK, come to think of it, this was a pretty useful room.</p>\n<p>CORRECTION: It is July 21, 2022 and Dave Grossman informs me it was he who worked on the circus.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-3c.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Touching the parrot puzzle was a little lame and linear.  I remember being rushed and we couldn&rsquo;t think of anything better.  The game was feeling good and long already, so I just punted on this puzzle.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-4b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>UI for having to open and close doors independently from walking though them was obnoxious.  You&rsquo;d never do this in an adventure game today, but like pixel hunting, it was accepted.</p>\n<p>Something I added to the Humongous Entertainment adventure games was the cursor changing into a big arrow when you hit the edge of the screen and it was an exit.  Monkey Island would have benefited from this.  I was so used to it from the Humongous games that I&rsquo;d scan the screen expecting to see it over exits.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-9a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>OK, I&rsquo;m going to admit that I was completely stumped by the grog puzzle.  I finally went and looked it up on the internet.  That&rsquo;s a damn good puzzle.  I found several puzzles would give me pause because I&rsquo;d remember some previous unimplemented version of them and it would throw me off track.  My brain is filled with a lot of old adventure game puzzles, most of which never made it into a game.  DeathSpank actually has a couple of puzzles ideas that we talked about for the original Monkey Island.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-5b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Stan&rsquo;s Grog machine was one of three interesting lessons was I given about trademarks and copyright during the production of Monkey Island.  Originally, I wanted the Grog Machine to be a Coke Machine, baring that, I wanted it to look like a Coke machine.  It originally had the &ldquo;Coke Wave&rdquo; on it, but said &ldquo;Grog&rdquo;.  The Lucasfilm legal team came back and said it was too close to the real trademarked Coke Wave.  I tried to argue Parody to no avail.  We kept changing it little by little until legal was satisfied it didn&rsquo;t look too much like a Coke machine.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-11b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Getting stuck on the Ocean floor is one of my favorite puzzles because the solution is so obvious most people overlook it.  The other puzzle I did in this same vane was in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade adventure game where Indy has to have faith and just walk over a ledge.  Players that had faith and just clicked on the other side of the crevice had no problem.  Players that fiddled around and clicked on other stuff, ignoring the advice, always fell.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-12a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I forgot about the ladder to get the pirate flag for the soup.  I kept focusing on Meat Hook&rsquo;s tattoo, which was something we talked about during the early design.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-13.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I had wanted the time you spent on Monkey Island to feel more like a RPG, which is why you had top-down view.  As the game progressed, I slowly scaled back those plans, but we were still left with these very cool maps.  I love maps.  For me a game design always starts with a map.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-8b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The key to the Monkey Head used to be called a Q-Tip(tm), but in my second legal lesson of the project it was changed.  According to our legal advice, it would have been OK if we were using the Q-Tip in a &ldquo;correct fashion&rdquo;, but taking a giant Q-Tip and sticking it into a stone monkey&rsquo;s ear is not &ldquo;correct usage&rdquo;.  Interestingly enough, a Q-Tip box states: &ldquo;Do not insert cotton swab into ear canal&rdquo;.  I think we were doing just that.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-17.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I had a feeling in hell here would be mushrooms&rdquo; was one of Tim&rsquo;s lines.  Tim hates Mushrooms.  I also hate mushrooms, but unlike Tim, I&rsquo;m happy to pick them out.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-31.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>We called them &ldquo;Special Case Animations&rdquo;.  The first SCUMM game they appeared in was The Last Crusade and then used to an amazing (well, amazing for 1990) extent in Monkey Island.   Each of the &ldquo;actor&rdquo; sprites had a set of basic animations that including standing, walking, talking, picking up and reaching.   If we need an animation that would only be used on one place, it was called a Special Case Animation and each one was carefully considered due to the 5 floppy disk limit.  Every pixel had to count.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-16.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Begging for the necklace from the head of the navigator is a bad puzzle.  It&rsquo;s too easy for players to think they&rsquo;re on the wrong path.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-5c.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>After getting the root, we didn&rsquo;t make the player walk all the way back to the cannibals then all the way to the ghost ship.  There was much discussion about this.  I think we made the right decision.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-12b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, Monkey Island is fairly open ended allowing players a lot of freedom to explore and solve several puzzle threads at a time, but there are two big choke points where the puzzles become very self contained.  The first is on the ship as you&rsquo;re sailing (or trying to sail to) Monkey Island.  The second is while you&rsquo;re on the ghost ship.  All the solutions to puzzles can be found right where you are.  These were done on purpose to give the player a small break and allow them to focus on one area.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-29a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve made you way back to Melee Island, you are forced to kill two ghost pirates with your root beer.  This was important because it showed not only how the root beer worked but that it would work.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-18.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Elaine Marley was just called &ldquo;The Governor&rdquo; until the scene in the church was written.  Dave Grossman wrote that scene and put in the gag dialog choice where Guybrush shouts &ldquo;Elaine!&rdquo;, which is from the movie &ldquo;The Graduate&rdquo;.  I liked that, so it became her name.  In the original design, Elaine was a more ruthless Governor, but she softened up and became a true love interested as the project processed.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-26.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>By design, the whole ending of the game is a &ldquo;gimme&rdquo;.   The player has worked hard to get to this point, I wanted something they could just sit back and enjoy playing.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-30.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>There was supposed to be ship combat during your voyage to Monkey Island.  It would have been done top-down view with you controlling the ship and firing a cannon.  It was right to cut that.  Never be afraid to cut.  It&rsquo;s rare that I watch a &ldquo;director&rsquo;s cut&rdquo; of a film that is better then the original.  Most of that stuff was left out for a reason.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-3d.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Last legal snafu we had with Monkey Island revolved about a &ldquo;Look At&rdquo; line in the voodoo shop.  When you&rsquo;d look at a statue, Guybrush would say &ldquo;Looks like an emaciated Charles Atlas.&rdquo;  We got a cease and desist letter for that and has to change it in future versions.  I don&rsquo;t know for sure when version it changed in.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-27.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>THE END</p>\n<p>P.S.  I was always bothered by these close-ups.  While they were great art, I never felt they matched the style of the rest of the game.  Not sure how I feel about them 20 years later.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<p>I&rsquo;m pretty good at keeping secrets.  I&rsquo;m so good at it people actually send me death threats.  If you have a secret, you can tell me.  I won&rsquo;t tell anyone.  Go ahead.  I&rsquo;m listening.</p>\n<p>Over the past few months, I&rsquo;ve been the vessel for a couple of very exciting secrets and it&rsquo;s been really hard to not give someone the nudge-nudge-wink-wink-don&rsquo;t-tell-anyone, but I couldn&rsquo;t.  Not these.</p>\n<p>The first is the <a href="http://www.monkeyislandspecialedition.com">re-release of The Secret of Monkey Island</a>.  Several months ago I was invited to LucasArts to get a sneak preview.  Very cool.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will open up the pure pleasure that is Monkey Island to a whole new generation of gamer that  knows only how to use a console controller.</p>\n<p>The second secret is that <a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/monkeyisland">TellTale is doing an episodic version of Monkey Island</a>.  I had the great pleasure of spending a few days with Dave Grossman, Mike Stemmle and the rest of the TellTale crew getting my head into Guybrush Threepwood again.</p>\n<p>I am very exited for both of these games.  It&rsquo;s strange and humbling to see something you created 20 years ago take on a life of it&rsquo;s own.</p>\n<p>This next year is going to be very interesting.  Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer all have games coming out.  Someone check the scriptures.  Might be a good time to start hoarding canned goods.</p>\n<p>About a year and a little more ago, as I began designing the <a href="http://deathspank.com">uber-awesome DeathSpank</a>, I played all the way through The Secret of Monkey Island to refresh myself on the puzzles and dialog.</p>\n<p>I know this will come as a shock to many of you, but I don&rsquo;t spend my evenings playing through Monkey Island.  It&rsquo;s probably been 15 years since I sat down and really played it.</p>\n<p>Much like the experience of watching the <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/maniac_mansion_speed_run">Maniac Mansion Speed Run</a>, it bought back a lot of memories and little tid-bits of facts, so I started keeping notes and in celebration of all things Monkey Island, I thought I&rsquo;d share them.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, a couple of points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Some of this I&rsquo;ve written about before, so I apologize if I&rsquo;m wasting your time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I was playing the VGA version that was released after the original EGA version.  The original original version used 16 colors and the inventory was text only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These are only &ldquo;some-what&rdquo; in order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may disagree with me on some of these, and that&rsquo;s perfectly OK.  My life is forever intertwined with this game and some of these are more reflective than anything else.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 20 years.  My brain is full.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If anyone has specific questions about Monkey Island 1 or 2, feel free to ask them in the comments or <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/contact">send them to me</a>.  If the answer contain interesting information or fuels a good story, I&rsquo;ll add it to this list.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-14.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Someone please turn off the lights, and I&rsquo;ll start the projector.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-1a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The very small &ldquo;hot spot&rdquo; areas are very annoying today but they were accepted back then; they were even considered a good thing.  It&rsquo;s called Game Play!  It would be hard to make an adventure game today where players were forced to hunt for small objects.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-3a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Most people know you can hit the period key to skip a single line of dialog, but I&rsquo;m surprised when I run into people that don&rsquo;t know why I chose the period key.  It seems obvious to me: a period ends a sentence.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-4a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>While Insult Sword Fighting is one of the first things people think of when they hear Monkey Island, I thought it seemed little tedious (but fun) as I played though it again.

This was important because it showed not only how the root beer worked but that it would work.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-18.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Elaine Marley was just called &ldquo;The Governor&rdquo; until the scene in the church was written.  Dave Grossman wrote that scene and put in the gag dialog choice where Guybrush shouts &ldquo;Elaine!&rdquo;, which is from the movie &ldquo;The Graduate&rdquo;.  I liked that, so it became her name.  In the original design, Elaine was a more ruthless Governor, but she softened up and became a true love interested as the project processed.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-26.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>By design, the whole ending of the game is a &ldquo;gimme&rdquo;.   The player has worked hard to get to this point, I wanted something they could just sit back and enjoy playing.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-30.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>There was supposed to be ship combat during your voyage to Monkey Island.  It would have been done top-down view with you controlling the ship and firing a cannon.  It was right to cut that.  Never be afraid to cut.  It&rsquo;s rare that I watch a &ldquo;director&rsquo;s cut&rdquo; of a film that is better then the original.  Most of that stuff was left out for a reason.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-3d.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Last legal snafu we had with Monkey Island revolved about a &ldquo;Look At&rdquo; line in the voodoo shop.  When you&rsquo;d look at a statue, Guybrush would say &ldquo;Looks like an emaciated Charles Atlas.&rdquo;  We got a cease and desist letter for that and has to change it in future versions.  I don&rsquo;t know for sure when version it changed in.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-27.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>THE END</p>\n<p>P.S.  I was always bothered by these close-ups.  While they were great art, I never felt they matched the style of the rest of the game.  Not sure how I feel about them 20 years later.</p>'}}

It is huge and feels huge.  The world is so visually tasty and really seems to be designed as a real world, not just a vehicle for quests.  After several days of questing, I made it to the coast, the sun was setting and I just stared out into the sea, letting my mind wonder, just like I do at the real Ocean.  Several other players were doing the same.  That is a real achievement.</li>\n<li>I find it amusing that when you loot a corpse while grouped, a &ldquo;roll a dice&rdquo; interface comes up to see who gets the booty.  It&rsquo;s an interesting holdover from the D&amp;D days.  Why dice?  Why not paper-scissor-rock.  That&rsquo;s why I would do.  Of course, one of my dreams has been to make the worlds first Massively Multiplayer Paper Scissor Rocks game (MMPSRG).  I actually wrote a whole design for it.</li>\n<li>I really enjoy (and am impressed by) the art style and art direction.  I&rsquo;ve always like the Warcraft world because it has a nice hint of cartoomieness (not a real word).   They translated this into a pure 3D environment perfectly.</li>\n<li>Why aren&rsquo;t other players more friendly?  It&rsquo;s not that people are rude, it&rsquo;s just that nobody is very chatty.  I&rsquo;ve tried to strike up conversations with several other people and am ignored or greeted with a simple &ldquo;hi&rdquo;, follow by a dash down the road.   Other than the people in my group, everyone else might as well be NPC&rsquo;s.</li>\n<li>I would like to see an option for &ldquo;word balloons&rdquo; above peoples heads when they speak.  I don&rsquo;t pay much attention to the chat area in the lower left.  This might help with the social aspect of chatting.</li>\n<li>The in-game maps stink.  The close-up ones are OK, but when you zoom out, there is no context.  You are really forced to hunt down better maps on the internet.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;d like to be able to mouse over buildings to see what they are.  I hate wandering into town and having to hunt down the right building.  I know you can mouse over the signs, but they often aren&rsquo;t visible.</li>\n<li>One of my favorite activities is what I call &ldquo;drive-by-cowing&rdquo;.  Once you get up in levels, you can take out a cow in a single swing.  Start about 100 feet way and run towards the cow, as you pass, swing and take it out.  Keep running and see how many cows you can take out.  It&rsquo;s twice as fun with someone following you taking screen shots.</li>\n<li>Nobody seems to mind that I go around killing livestock, which I assume the locals use for meat, milk and possibly companionship on a lonely night.  Maybe if I keep doing it, people will slowly start to starve and I&rsquo;ll feel bad.  I&rsquo;d like to see the guards come over and give me a little sword-smack for killing cows and sheep.</li>\n<li>Why can bears and boars resist my magic?  Come on, they&rsquo;re animals, and not wicked-cool magic animals, just plain old animals.  Makes no sense.  Suspension of disbelief alert.</li>\n<li>It&rsquo;s pretty funny to see someone being chased by a &ldquo;train&rdquo; of monsters.  We were exploring this old mine the other day, and while standing in a tunnel some guys runs by the entrance being chanced by 5 Tunnel Rats.  Do I help out?  No, I just &ldquo;/point-n-laugh&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>All the vendors seem to sell the same stuff.  It&rsquo;s like they all have the same distributor.  I&rsquo;d like to find more interesting items at different places.  I started out looking for some better Maces, but soon gave up when I realized it&rsquo;s just a chain store.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m currently at Level 15, and I&rsquo;ve been in the weapon, armor and magic doldrums for quite a few levels now.  Nothing really new and interesting.  I&rsquo;m starting to tire of my mace and the same 3 magic spells.  I&rsquo;m a product of the MTV generation, I need new spells every 15 minutes.</li>\n<li>Needs more Pirates!</li>\n<li>You should get extra XP for killing a new creatures for the first time.  It was really disappointing to discover the Mechanical Golems, excitingly enter battle and discover that I got the same XP as I did for the Bear down the road.  I realize that it&rsquo;s all numbers under the veneer of a texture-map, but it was new for me, and I wanted to be rewarded.</li>\n<li>Can you move a character to another server?  I didn&rsquo;t see a way to do this, and I don&rsquo;t see any reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to.  It was very frustrating to run into someone (in the real world&hellip;stay with me) and find out they are playing, but we&rsquo;re on different server.  I can see how they wouldn&rsquo;t want people jumping servers on a whim, but having it take a few days, or give a character a limited number of jumps would be nice.</li>\n<li>I am always annoyed by games that they to make inventory management a game-play mechanism.  Why can I only carry 12 things?  Why does a huge two hand rock-hammer take as much space as 10 drops of spider spuge?  Seems like I should be able to carry as much spider spuge as I want.</li>\n<li>The city of Stormwind is simple amazing.  It real feels like you&rsquo;re in the midsts of a real husseling and busseling city.  I am constantly amazed and impressed with the layout and architecture of the world.  We have come to call this place &ldquo;Mall of America&rdquo;.  All it needs is a Roller-coaster in the middle.</li>\n<li>The fact that the Tram and the Gryphon rides that place in the 3D world is great.  They could have cheaped out and made them canned sequences, but they didn&rsquo;t.  It&rsquo;s fun to see other people battling for XP below you, or see someone fly-by on a Gryphon as you track over the mountains.</li>\n<li>I would really like to see some sort of story.  Oh sure, there is a story in the opening cut-scene about something or another, fact is I watched about 7 seconds of it before hitting ESC.   I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;m running around killing everything that I see, getting XP, getting money and repeating the cycle.  I&rsquo;d like to think there was some greater goal we were all reaching for, and one that really mattered to my character and my day-to-day actions.  I know some other MMG&rsquo;s has tried to do this sort of thing with limited success.</li>\n<li>I like the game play mechanism of dying and being taken to the closest cemetery, then trekking as a ghost to recover your body.  It feels right in terms of risky actions verses the penalty.  Last night we discovered a cave system under a building.  As we walked though the deserted tunnels, my heart was beating and I was genuinely worried about running into a group of Bandits and dying.  In a single player game, I would have just saved and all the tension would have been gone.  We did end up dying, but 3 minutes later we we back in our bodies running like hell to get out.  Perfect experience.</li>\n<li>I really dislike the class system found in most D&amp;D inspired RPG&rsquo;s.  It make little sense to me that just because I am a Paladin I can&rsquo;t use a gun.  Seems like I should be able to use what ever I train for and get good at.  There could be certain skills that counter each other, like getting good at magic could demising your sword-play.  I want to pick up a gun and try to blast things.  I&rsquo;m not asking to be very good at it, but at least let me try it.</li>\n<li>There were a lot of people playing on Valentines Day&hellip;just saying.</li>\n<li>I am curious to know the story behind the simultaneous release of the Mac and Windows versions.  The only reason I own this game is because there is a Mac version.  What was the decision making process?  Are there any lessons for other publishers to learn?</li>\n<li>And finally, why the hell can&rsquo;t they remember my username and password.  Just a little checkbox that says &ldquo;Remember Username and Password&rdquo; would be great.  I am the only person that uses my machine, and if it was compromised, the last thing I would be worrying about the 129 pieces of copper being held by my character.</li>\n<li>I realize the preceding bullet points contain a lot of nitpicking criticism, but they are just that, nitpicking.  Over all, this is one incredibly impressive game.  I can only imagine the amount of work that went into the designing and construction of the worlds, towns and buildings.  While I&rsquo;ve sure there is to some degree, I can&rsquo;t detect any cookie cutter places.</li>\n<li>The game is strangely (for me anyway) addictive.  I play for a few hours every day.  Afterwards, I feel like I wasted my evening or weekend, only to be anxious to get back to it the next day.  It is quickly becoming the game I&rsquo;ve played the most.</li>\n<li>I do wonder why I play the game so much.  For me, it is really a two player LAN game.  The fact that 600,000 other people are also playing is irrelevant, or is it?  I don&rsquo;t interact with anyone else, for all I care those other players are NPC&rsquo;s, but there is something enticing about being with other people, even if you ignore each other.  Maybe that&rsquo;s why I enjoy going to the movies and sitting in the dark with a bunch of strangers.</li>\n<li>Good news is, no ones cell phone as rung during combat.  &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hey!  Guess what I&rsquo;m doing?  Yeah, Killing a Trogg, it&rsquo;s awesome dude.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now for the obligatory screen shots:</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow5.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow1.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow2.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow3.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow4.jpg" />', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<p>I am not a big player of MMORPMMGOMMGS, the last one I spent any time on being Ultima Online when it first came out, plus a few hours on EverQuest, so I might be impressed by things that are old-hat&hellip;</p>\n<p>In the interest of brevity and for all the executives and marketing people that read the Grumpy Gamer, I figured I&rsquo;d just bullet point my feedback.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I am awestruck by the scope of the world.

Once you get up in levels, you can take out a cow in a single swing.  Start about 100 feet way and run towards the cow, as you pass, swing and take it out.  Keep running and see how many cows you can take out.  It&rsquo;s twice as fun with someone following you taking screen shots.</li>\n<li>Nobody seems to mind that I go around killing livestock, which I assume the locals use for meat, milk and possibly companionship on a lonely night.  Maybe if I keep doing it, people will slowly start to starve and I&rsquo;ll feel bad.  I&rsquo;d like to see the guards come over and give me a little sword-smack for killing cows and sheep.</li>\n<li>Why can bears and boars resist my magic?  Come on, they&rsquo;re animals, and not wicked-cool magic animals, just plain old animals.  Makes no sense.  Suspension of disbelief alert.</li>\n<li>It&rsquo;s pretty funny to see someone being chased by a &ldquo;train&rdquo; of monsters.  We were exploring this old mine the other day, and while standing in a tunnel some guys runs by the entrance being chanced by 5 Tunnel Rats.  Do I help out?  No, I just &ldquo;/point-n-laugh&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>All the vendors seem to sell the same stuff.  It&rsquo;s like they all have the same distributor.  I&rsquo;d like to find more interesting items at different places.  I started out looking for some better Maces, but soon gave up when I realized it&rsquo;s just a chain store.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m currently at Level 15, and I&rsquo;ve been in the weapon, armor and magic doldrums for quite a few levels now.  Nothing really new and interesting.  I&rsquo;m starting to tire of my mace and the same 3 magic spells.  I&rsquo;m a product of the MTV generation, I need new spells every 15 minutes.</li>\n<li>Needs more Pirates!</li>\n<li>You should get extra XP for killing a new creatures for the first time.  It was really disappointing to discover the Mechanical Golems, excitingly enter battle and discover that I got the same XP as I did for the Bear down the road.  I realize that it&rsquo;s all numbers under the veneer of a texture-map, but it was new for me, and I wanted to be rewarded.</li>\n<li>Can you move a character to another server?  I didn&rsquo;t see a way to do this, and I don&rsquo;t see any reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to.  It was very frustrating to run into someone (in the real world&hellip;stay with me) and find out they are playing, but we&rsquo;re on different server.  I can see how they wouldn&rsquo;t want people jumping servers on a whim, but having it take a few days, or give a character a limited number of jumps would be nice.</li>\n<li>I am always annoyed by games that they to make inventory management a game-play mechanism.  Why can I only carry 12 things?  Why does a huge two hand rock-hammer take as much space as 10 drops of spider spuge?  Seems like I should be able to carry as much spider spuge as I want.</li>\n<li>The city of Stormwind is simple amazing.  It real feels like you&rsquo;re in the midsts of a real husseling and busseling city.  I am constantly amazed and impressed with the layout and architecture of the world.  We have come to call this place &ldquo;Mall of America&rdquo;.  All it needs is a Roller-coaster in the middle.</li>\n<li>The fact that the Tram and the Gryphon rides that place in the 3D world is great.  They could have cheaped out and made them canned sequences, but they didn&rsquo;t.  It&rsquo;s fun to see other people battling for XP below you, or see someone fly-by on a Gryphon as you track over the mountains.</li>\n<li>I would really like to see some sort of story.  Oh sure, there is a story in the opening cut-scene about something or another, fact is I watched about 7 seconds of it before hitting ESC.   I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;m running around killing everything that I see, getting XP, getting money and repeating the cycle.  I&rsquo;d like to think there was some greater goal we were all reaching for, and one that really mattered to my character and my day-to-day actions.  I know some other MMG&rsquo;s has tried to do this sort of thing with limited success.</li>\n<li>I like the game play mechanism of dying and being taken to the closest cemetery, then trekking as a ghost to recover your body.  It feels right in terms of risky actions verses the penalty.  Last night we discovered a cave system under a building.  As we walked though the deserted tunnels, my heart was beating and I was genuinely worried about running into a group of Bandits and dying.  In a single player game, I would have just saved and all the tension would have been gone.  We did end up dying, but 3 minutes later we we back in our bodies running like hell to get out.  Perfect experience.</li>\n<li>I really dislike the class system found in most D&amp;D inspired RPG&rsquo;s.  It make little sense to me that just because I am a Paladin I can&rsquo;t use a gun.  Seems like I should be able to use what ever I train for and get good at.  There could be certain skills that counter each other, like getting good at magic could demising your sword-play.  I want to pick up a gun and try to blast things.  I&rsquo;m not asking to be very good at it, but at least let me try it.</li>\n<li>There were a lot of people playing on Valentines Day&hellip;just saying.</li>\n<li>I am curious to know the story behind the simultaneous release of the Mac and Windows versions.  The only reason I own this game is because there is a Mac version.  What was the decision making process?  Are there any lessons for other publishers to learn?</li>\n<li>And finally, why the hell can&rsquo;t they remember my username and password.  Just a little checkbox that says &ldquo;Remember Username and Password&rdquo; would be great.  I am the only person that uses my machine, and if it was compromised, the last thing I would be worrying about the 129 pieces of copper being held by my character.</li>\n<li>I realize the preceding bullet points contain a lot of nitpicking criticism, but they are just that, nitpicking.  Over all, this is one incredibly impressive game.  I can only imagine the amount of work that went into the designing and construction of the worlds, towns and buildings.  While I&rsquo;ve sure there is to some degree, I can&rsquo;t detect any cookie cutter places.</li>\n<li>The game is strangely (for me anyway) addictive.  I play for a few hours every day.  Afterwards, I feel like I wasted my evening or weekend, only to be anxious to get back to it the next day.  It is quickly becoming the game I&rsquo;ve played the most.</li>\n<li>I do wonder why I play the game so much.  For me, it is really a two player LAN game.  The fact that 600,000 other people are also playing is irrelevant, or is it?  I don&rsquo;t interact with anyone else, for all I care those other players are NPC&rsquo;s, but there is something enticing about being with other people, even if you ignore each other.  Maybe that&rsquo;s why I enjoy going to the movies and sitting in the dark with a bunch of strangers.</li>\n<li>Good news is, no ones cell phone as rung during combat.  &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hey!  Guess what I&rsquo;m doing?  Yeah, Killing a Trogg, it&rsquo;s awesome dude.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now for the obligatory screen shots:</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow5.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow1.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow2.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow3.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow4.jpg" />'}}

In the days before Steam and Kickstarter, but most of it is still applicable, but a lot has also changed.</h3>\n<p>Someone recently submitted a question asking what it would take to build a classic 2D point-n-click adventure today and would it be a viable business?  The internet is filled with classic adventure fan sites centered around the LucasArts and Sierra games and a common thread is always how much people would like to see new ones being made, and why isn&rsquo;t it being done.</p>\n<p>These are interesting questions that I&rsquo;ve ponder a lot in the last year, but never really looked into it in any detail.</p>\n<p>Now, before I launch into this long stream-of-consciousness, there are a couple of important things to understand.  First, this is only a thought experiment.  This is not something I am planning on doing, or even have a huge interest in doing, so please don&rsquo;t feed the rumor mills.  Second, this article contains gory and gruesome details about the games business and, in particular, marketing and distribution.  If you&rsquo;d rather remain blissfully oblivious to the horrors of what goes on behind the scenes, this is the place to stop reading.  If you&rsquo;re one of those people that can&rsquo;t help but stare at a car accident, read on.</p>\n<p>For this exercise, I am going to make a few assumptions.</p>\n<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>\n<h3 id="1-were-building-a-classic-2d-point-n-click-adventure-game">1) We&rsquo;re building a classic 2D point-n-click adventure game.</h3>\n<p>Building the game in 3D is a much more costly endeavor that brings with it a whole slew of complications which I won&rsquo;t get in to in this article.  The goal here is a class point-n-click adventure.</p>\n<h3 id="2-were-hiring-real-employees-to-build-the-game">2) We&rsquo;re hiring real employees to build the game.</h3>\n<p>Clearly, the game could be done cheaper with hobbyists or people passionate enough about the genre to work for free or below cost, for back-end, or with a trust-fund baby on staff, but the goal in putting together this plan is to explore it as real business, and our business model is a little screwed if we count on people working for free.  Also, given that deadlines will become important, it&rsquo;s necessary to have everyone&rsquo;s full attention and nothing says that better then a paycheck, except maybe a cattle-prod, but that might be illegal.  I&rsquo;d have to check.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to hire the best people possible.  This is not a diss to the hobbyist market, there are some very talented people out there, but we&rsquo;ll need our team all in one place and not working at other jobs or going to school.  If you&rsquo;re an unemployed adventure game developer hobbyist, please contact our fictional company for a fictional job interview.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also assuming we have to pay competitive wages, and most of my pay information comes from the Seattle area, so we&rsquo;ll use that data for now.  It&rsquo;s probably more expensive in the Bay Area, but cheaper in India.</p>\n<h3 id="3-were-going-to-focus-on-the-development-and-product-related-costs-only">3) We&rsquo;re going to focus on the development and product related costs only.</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of other overhead in running a company, even a small developer, we&rsquo;ll ignore those.  There are also huge costs associated being a publisher, like marketing, sales, distribution, graft, etc.  We&rsquo;ll ignore these for now, but touch on them later on the article.</p>\n<h3 id="4-the-engine-technology-is-not-included-in-the-costs">4) The engine technology is not included in the costs.</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of 2D engines out there that will do what we need, so we&rsquo;ll just assume we&rsquo;re using one of those.  I realize that many of them are Open Source, which could complicate or help our situation.  I&rsquo;m going to call it a wash and ignore the whole situation for now.  Trust me, It&rsquo;s not that hard to get your hands on a good solid 2D engine for next to nothing.</p>\n<h3 id="5-the-game-is-state-of-the-art-as-far-as-2d-goes">5) The game is state-of-the-art, as far as 2D goes.</h3>\n<p>Yeah, I know.  The last time you read state-of-the-art and 2D in the same sentence was back in the early 90&rsquo;s.  The game will be fully animated and include wall-to-wall original music and full voice.  No corners will be cut in the quality of the production.</p>\n<p>Although some styles of art might be cheaper to produce than others, I don&rsquo;t think the savings is going to be dramatic.  We might want to go with a pre-rendered 3D look rather then the traditional 2D animation found in a lot of 2D adventure games.  Doing pre-rendered 3D might be a little more expensive because the tools tended to cost a lot, and 3D animators (as a rule) can be more expensive.  People argue that you end up saving because it&rsquo;s easier to animate once you have the models built, but I have not seen this to be true, but my experience is a little limited in this area.</p>\n<h3 id="6-were-going-to-build-the-game-in-a-year">6) We&rsquo;re going to build the game in a year.</h3>\n<p>For a classic point-n-click adventure, this is aggressive, but should be doable.  Monkey Island took less than a year.  We&rsquo;ll need a lot more art, but that&rsquo;s a production issue and can easily be made up for with more people to a certain extent.  We&rsquo;re also going to do a very rigorous pre-production, this will be essential in getting the game done on time and on budget.  Since we&rsquo;re dealing with known technology, this should be very predictable.</p>\n<h3 id="7-were-using-an-established-publisher-for-the-game-and-not-self-publishing">7) We&rsquo;re using an established publisher for the game, and not self-publishing.</h3>\n<p>Starting a company that will self-publish the game into retail channels is a huge undertaking and would require some significant capital.  Not impossible, but we&rsquo;d need money beyond the cost of development, and that is a whole different business plan.  It&rsquo;s also hard to become a retail based publisher with a single game.  You need several games to have any clout with the retailers.  We could do a distribution deal, but then we&rsquo;re significantly cutting into our profit.  As the last two sentences suggest, we&rsquo;re also assuming in-store distribution, online distribution will be covered later.</p>\n<h3 id="8-its-a-pc-game">8) It&rsquo;s a PC game</h3>\n<p>Dealing with the console manufactures on something like this would be a nightmare, plus the royalties you pay to them would kill us with a nitch game like this and it&rsquo;s just not the venue for these types of games.  At least not to start.</p>\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s roll up our sleeves, pull out our slide-rules and get down to business.</p>\n<h2 id="development-costs-and-plan">Development costs and plan</h2>\n<p>Staffing is the main expense, and is always a hotly debated topic.  Everyone has an opinion, and I&rsquo;m sure this will be no different.  Until a complete pre-production is done, it&rsquo;s hard to nail this cost down.  These figures are based on my experience building adventures at Humongous Entertainment and at my last company Hulabee Entertainment.  We probably built more 2D graphic adventure games than any other company in the world and we had a finely tuned production process.  Granted, these games were for kids, but that only affects the scope of the project.  If you&rsquo;ve ever played any of those games, you will understand what I mean.</p>\n<p>Remember, not everyone on this list would be on the project for the entire 12 months.  This creates some complications because you need to keep people around to ensure a skilled staff for the next game.  Hopefully we could get two games going in such a way that people would be moved off one project onto another.  One advantage the movie business has is an infrastructure to deal with production people coming and going from projects.  In the game business we don&rsquo;t have that.  But, I&rsquo;m going to ignore this issue for now.  We&rsquo;ll assume there are other projects to keep people busy and there is no down-time.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also going to assume the design and creative lead is either the lead programmer, lead artist, or both.</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer (will also deal with engine issues)\nLead Artist\nProducer</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $220,000</strong></p>\n<p>3 Programmers (in the scripting language)<br />\n5 Artists (skilled in 2D animation)\\</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $480,000</strong></p>\n<p>Testing</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $30,000</strong></p>\n<p>Other expenses that will be contracted out:</p>\n<p>Script\nMusic<br />\nSound<br />\nVoice talent (non-union)<br />\nVoice recording</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $60,000</strong></p>\n<p>The total cost for a 12 month project - including a standard 20% overhead for insurance, taxes, graft, paper-clips and a little rounding up - comes to:</p>\n<p><strong>Project Development Total: $950,000</strong></p>\n<p>Now, we can argue all day about how much we&rsquo;re paying people, whether someone is over or under payed, etc.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  My defense is that this comes from my direct experience in hiring people to do the exact same jobs.  We can certainly save some money by hiring talented people with no experience, and that often works very well, but I&rsquo;m assuming that at least half the people are experienced in the business.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve kept the team pretty lean.  It would be easy to dump the Producer, but that would be a huge mistake.  A good and talented Producer is gold.  We can also save a little money if the script or music is done by someone already on the team, but that will take them away from their other job and you have to ask yourself:  are they really the best person for the task?</p>\n<p>This cost is also just for development.  If we&rsquo;re going to fully evaluate the prospects of a 2D point-n-click adventure in today&rsquo;s market, we need to think about marketing costs on top of development.  Even if we use an established publisher, we&rsquo;re going to need to include this in order to evaluate the ROI (return on investment) that a publisher is going to look at.</p>\n<h2 id="marketing-costs">Marketing Costs</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s assume marketing costs comes in at $500,000.  This figure is probably about half of what it should be.  We can&rsquo;t just take out full page ads in the game rags and pepper the gaming sites with banner ads.  We&rsquo;re going to need a good solid grass-roots campaign.  If we&rsquo;re really clever we could get away with a number like this.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon to spend as much on marketing as it cost to develop the game.  The marketing budgets for mainstream console games reach $10 million and more, but since we&rsquo;re not doing console, we save the drain of TV ads.  We can also be clever with our PR and get the marketing costs down as much as possible.  Lots of PR will go a long way on the initial game, but once the novelty wears off (and competition begins), we&rsquo;ll have to spend marketing money.   As sad as it is, the best games don&rsquo;t always sell just because they are good.  It takes good marketing to be successful.  Never underestimate good marketing.</p>\n<p>One big area of concern here is if we&rsquo;re going through a publisher, we&rsquo;re going to have to rely on them being clever with marketing and PR.  That&rsquo;s a big risk.  Most publisher try and fit everything into a template.  We&rsquo;re going to need a publisher that is willing to think differently about this.  It&rsquo;s an important trait to be looking for as we hunt for a publisher.  But, as anyone who is pitching a 2D adventure game today will tell you, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of choices.</p>\n<p>I see this as the single-most risky part of this venture.</p>\n<p>For the first part of this evaluation, we&rsquo;re going to assume we&rsquo;re going through retail distribution.  In reality, this is the most likely scenario.  But more on that later.</p>\n<h1 id="retail-distribution">Retail Distribution</h1>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll do that math for three different price points, $19, $29 and $39.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s realistic to assume a $49 price.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure this is obvious to most everyone, but I&rsquo;ll point it out anyway.  The publisher does not get the full retail price of the game.  The stores have to make a profit as well.  The publisher sells the game to the retailer for what&rsquo;s called the Wholesale price.  The store can then sell the game for whatever they want, but for the most part, they use the following numbers:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Wholesale $15</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Wholesale $22</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Wholesale $30</strong></p>\n<p>There is also MDF (Marketing Development Funds) and co-op charges that the publisher needs to pay the retailer, and those typically run 6% of the Wholesale price billed quarterly, net of returns.  These cost go to cover in-store advertising, news-paper circulars, etc.  In addition, publishers also pay to have their games on &ldquo;end-caps&rdquo; or have special &ldquo;shelf-talkers&rdquo; (they don&rsquo;t really talk, thank-god, but I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s coming) that helps point out the product.  General rule of thumb is: if there is anything in the store that calls any attention to the game, it was paid for by the publisher.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll assume we&rsquo;re not going to pay for anything beyond the required co-op and MDF, but it might be a wise investment to buy some better placement.</p>\n<p>We also have the cost of the box, CD, manual, shipping, graft, etc.  This is called Cost of Goods, or COGs for short.  This will typically be $1.50 unless we want to throw some cool extra stuff in the box like we used to do in the olden-days.  Could be a good idea for the initial launch, if so, we&rsquo;ll bill that to marketing.</p>\n<p>There are also fees for outside sales commissions, distribution, EDI (electronic inventory management), inventory management, field merchandising, etc.  This will add another $1 to the cost of our game.</p>\n<p>We need to assume that we&rsquo;re going to get returns.  These might come from damaged product, customer returns, or games that the just don&rsquo;t sell.  We have to account for this, it&rsquo;s typically 20%.  As a side note, next time a store tells you they can&rsquo;t take a game back because the publisher won&rsquo;t take it back, call bullshit.  Of course, it&rsquo;s not as simple as the publisher giving the money back, it&rsquo;s typically done as credit, and it&rsquo;s often negotiated with respect to new games being bought from the publisher.  It is one of the reason that a single game publisher is going to have a hard time.</p>\n<p>So after all this, plus a little rounding, we&rsquo;re down to the following profit:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Profit $9</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Profit $18</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Profit $25</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s now time to calculate our break-even point.  That is the point that our publisher has made all their money back.  To do this, we divide the total cost of the project by the profit at each price-point.</p>\n<p>Our game cost $1,400,000 to build and (minimally) market, so to break-even we need to sell the following units at each price-point:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Break even units 155,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Break even units 75,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Break even units 56,000</strong></p>\n<p>Hmmmm&hellip;.</p>\n<p>There is quite a jump from the $19 to the $29 price point.  It will be tempting to try and sell it at $29, but with a game like this, we might need the lower price-point.  But the lower price point could leave some buyers with the feeling that the game isn&rsquo;t worth the full price, and that somethings wrong with it.  Game players are always screaming about wanting lower prices, but the truth is, if you lower the price too far, people stop buying it (unless it&rsquo;s a high profile game).</p>\n<p>155,000 or 75,000 units doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but our publisher is not in business to break-even, we&rsquo;re probably going to need to sell two or three times that.  Not every game we do is going to be a success, no matter how hard we try and how good we are.  If we&rsquo;re going to push some creative boundaries, we&rsquo;re going to need to experiment, and that&rsquo;s going to mean some failures.  We need to make a lot more then just break-even.  A publisher or investor is going to look at spending a dollar on this verses spending a dollar on something else.  This has to be a compelling option for them.  Break-even is not compelling.</p>\n<p><a href="http://people.freenet.de/lucasfangames/maniac/games_eng.htm">Maniac Mansion Deluxe</a>, the fan remake of Maniac Mansion, racked up over 200,000 downloads in a very short time, while it was free, it does show a strong interest.  How much of that was just &ldquo;nostalgia&rdquo; could be an important questions to answer.  How many of those people would spend $19 or $29 for a new game is another question I don&rsquo;t have the answer to.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at online distribution, after all, we are living in the futuristic year of 2004.</p>\n<h1 id="online-distribution">Online Distribution</h1>\n<p>Online has one big advantage:  It cuts out the middle-man, allowing us to get the full retail price of the game.  Online also has one big disadvantage: it cuts out the middle-man.  Having the game sit on a store shelf gets it in front of people eyes, it also gives it this sense of legitimacy, like a hardcover book does in the book publishing business.  The perception of shelf presence will vanish at some point, but it is a reality today.  There is a good reason why games like EverQuest are sold in stores and not exclusively online.</p>\n<p>If we only have an online presence, we need to do something to drive people to our website.  That&rsquo;s going to require more marketing, promotions, tie-ins, etc.  We can count on the buzz of our game being the first 2D point-n-click in fifty-years, but that is only in certain circles.  We need to reach beyond that.  It&rsquo;s also the kind of buzz that dies quickly.  If we plan on doing more than one game, we need some kind of sustainable way to get people back to our site.</p>\n<p>The issues surrounding marketing are not unique to online sales, just complicated by it being new and different.</p>\n<p>Online distribution is also not free.  Bandwidth costs money.  If we plan on the game being successful, we need servers and bandwidth able to handle huge simultaneous downloads.   With all the animation, voice, music, graft, etc, we could approach 1GB.  Nothing will kill our sales faster than willing customers that are unable to download the game at a reasonable speed.  Research I did several years ago into online distribution showed that, allowing for peak usage, bandwidth cost could run $5 per download.  A lot might have changed since then.  It was at the peak of the dot.com thingy.</p>\n<p>No doubt, someone will bring up BitTorrent and other P2P systems as a method of distribution.  Assuming that our purchasing model can deal with it, it is a good alternate way to get the game to people, but does it really hit all the people we want to be buying the game?  If we&rsquo;re trying to hit a broader audience, we need a fast, simple and direct way for them to download our game.</p>\n<p>System like Steam and even custom BitTorrent clients are very real possibilities, but they are risky and untested and will cost is time and money.  Publishers and investors don&rsquo;t like risk.  They are already taking a big one on the game, the fewer risky parts to our plan the better.</p>\n<p>With online distribution there are also issues with accepting credit cards, dealing with returns, unhappy customers, copy protection, unlock keys, graft, etc, etc, etc.</p>\n<p>We will also have to overcome the &ldquo;everything is free on the internet&rdquo; mentality.  Many companies have - so it&rsquo;s far from insurmountable - but it is an issue that needs to be considered.  Piracy is also a huge problem.  When you have a main-stream product, be it a game, music or a movie, you are some-what insulated from piracy because of high volume.  When you&rsquo;re dealing with a nitch market - like a 2D point-n-click would be - you are much more susceptible to the negative effects of piracy due to the smaller market and lower volume.</p>\n<p>Finding an online publisher would solve some of these problems (or shift them to someone more equipped to deal with them), but I have yet to find a online publisher willing to spend the kind of money we&rsquo;re needing for an online distributed game of this scale.  They are very much in the mindset of small webish games for the casual gamer.  In contrast, conventional publishers are used to spending larger sums of money on games.</p>\n<p>Online distribution seems great until you start to really look into it.  It&rsquo;s rife with issues, but shouldn&rsquo;t be discounted.  At the end of the day, we&rsquo;d probably settle on some of both.</p>\n<p>The last issue is developer royalties.</p>\n<h1 id="developer-royalties">Developer Royalties</h1>\n<p>If we go with a publisher, we are going to get a cut of the wholesale price.  We&rsquo;ll assume a rate of 20%.  It is also typical for the developer to recoup the development costs before any real money is paid out.  What is recoupment and how is it calculated?</p>\n<p>As a developer, we are &ldquo;loaned&rdquo; the money to build the game, in our case $950,000 (most publishers do not bill the developer for marketing, some do).  We need to pay that money back to the publisher.  When the game is sold, we get our 20% of the Wholesale price, but we have to pay back our loan, so we won&rsquo;t get any money until our royalties have reached $950,000.</p>\n<p>To calculate the developers break-even, we take the $950,000 we &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; and divide that by 20% of the wholesale price.  So for the developer to start making money, the game needs to sell the following units at each price point:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Developer break even units 320,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Developer break even units 220,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Developer break even units 160,000</strong></p>\n<p>Double Hmmmm&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Whether the whole developer royalty model is fair or not is not the point of this article, so let&rsquo;s not get side-tracked on that.  It&rsquo;s the way the industry works, and we&rsquo;ll have to live with it until the armed revolution of 2007.  As the date approaches, keep checking this site for instructions.</p>\n<h2 id="some-final-thoughts">Some final thoughts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember, this thought-experiment was about building a modern 2D adventure game in today&rsquo;s market.  There are a lot of other styles of games that can be made cheaper.  Stay focused.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of issues and sub-issues I have not talked about, or only briefly touch upon, so this should not be used as anything other than a conversation starter.</li>\n<li>There are an endless number of cheap ways to do marketing and ways to cut development cost.  If this was a real business plan, all those would be thoroughly thought through.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of alternate distribution models that we could explore beyond the traditional retail sales and emerging online.  We could do it as shareware, advertising funded, bundled with cereal, etc.  The list is endless, but they are also risky and unlikely to get us the funding to build the game.  For this thought experiment, we&rsquo;re trying to build a viable business likely to get funding from an investor or publisher.</li>\n<li>Anyone attempting this is going to have to find a publisher (or become a publisher) that is willing to put out several games before evaluating the success of the venture.  It&rsquo;s going to take a few really good games before this catches on.  If our publisher (or we) gives up after an initial failure, it will never succeed.  A longer term vision is needed.</li>\n<li>We need to expand the audience beyond the current 2D adventure fan base.  While this is a large and dedicated group, it needs to be larger and growing.  We need to appeal (with the game and the marketing) to a new set of people who are not exclusively interested in high-testosterone 3D gaming.  Games like Grim Fandango had a very wide appeal, but were miss-marketed and abandoned to quickly.</li>\n<li>We should build a Mac and possibly a Linux version of the game.  We need every channel we can get.  Linux poses some problems (perceptionally and technically), but they are worth solving.  I have not thought a lot about the Linux issues, they might be simple.</li>\n<li>We&rsquo;re going to need to come up with truly innovative stories and modern game play.  We can&rsquo;t just mimic the adventure games of the past.  We have some huge graphic perceptions to overcome, at least as a first impression.  Everyone talks about game-play being king.  We would need to prove it.</li>\n<li>We should think about a licensed property, but the economics of it probably don&rsquo;t make any sense.  And it&rsquo;s not as much fun.</li>\n<li>There is not going to be a lot of profit on the back-end.  While we do need to build a viable business, in the end of the day, it&rsquo;s got to be something we love, because it&rsquo;s not going to be much more than a paycheck.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fun to think about&hellip;</p>\n<p>Now everyone back to the salt-mines&hellip;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<h3 id="note-i-wrote-this-in-2004-in-the-days-before-steam-and-kickstarter-but-most-of-it-is-still-applicable-but-a-lot-has-also-changed">Note: I wrote this in 2004. In the days before Steam and Kickstarter, but most of it is still applicable, but a lot has also changed.</h3>\n<p>Someone recently submitted a question asking what it would take to build a classic 2D point-n-click adventure today and would it be a viable business?  The internet is filled with classic adventure fan sites centered around the LucasArts and Sierra games and a common thread is always how much people would like to see new ones being made, and why isn&rsquo;t it being done.</p>\n<p>These are interesting questions that I&rsquo;ve ponder a lot in the last year, but never really looked into it in any detail.</p>\n<p>Now, before I launch into this long stream-of-consciousness, there are a couple of important things to understand.  First, this is only a thought experiment.  This is not something I am planning on doing, or even have a huge interest in doing, so please don&rsquo;t feed the rumor mills.  Second, this article contains gory and gruesome details about the games business and, in particular, marketing and distribution.  If you&rsquo;d rather remain blissfully oblivious to the horrors of what goes on behind the scenes, this is the place to stop reading.  If you&rsquo;re one of those people that can&rsquo;t help but stare at a car accident, read on.</p>\n<p>For this exercise, I am going to make a few assumptions.</p>\n<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>\n<h3 id="1-were-building-a-classic-2d-point-n-click-adventure-game">1) We&rsquo;re building a classic 2D point-n-click adventure game.</h3>\n<p>Building the game in 3D is a much more costly endeavor that brings with it a whole slew of complications which I won&rsquo;t get in to in this article.  The goal here is a class point-n-click adventure.</p>\n<h3 id="2-were-hiring-real-employees-to-build-the-game">2) We&rsquo;re hiring real employees to build the game.</h3>\n<p>Clearly, the game could be done cheaper with hobbyists or people passionate enough about the genre to work for free or below cost, for back-end, or with a trust-fund baby on staff, but the goal in putting together this plan is to explore it as real business, and our business model is a little screwed if we count on people working for free.  Also, given that deadlines will become important, it&rsquo;s necessary to have everyone&rsquo;s full attention and nothing says that better then a paycheck, except maybe a cattle-prod, but that might be illegal.  I&rsquo;d have to check.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to hire the best people possible.  This is not a diss to the hobbyist market, there are some very talented people out there, but we&rsquo;ll need our team all in one place and not working at other jobs or going to school.  If you&rsquo;re an unemployed adventure game developer hobbyist, please contact our fictional company for a fictional job interview.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also assuming we have to pay competitive wages, and most of my pay information comes from the Seattle area, so we&rsquo;ll use that data for now.  It&rsquo;s probably more expensive in the Bay Area, but cheaper in India.</p>\n<h3 id="3-were-going-to-focus-on-the-development-and-product-related-costs-only">3) We&rsquo;re going to focus on the development and product related costs only.</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of other overhead in running a company, even a small developer, we&rsquo;ll ignore those.  There are also huge costs associated being a publisher, like marketing, sales, distribution, graft, etc.  We&rsquo;ll ignore these for now, but touch on them later on the article.</p>\n<h3 id="4-the-engine-technology-is-not-included-in-the-costs">4) The engine technology is not included in the costs.</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of 2D engines out there that will do what we need, so we&rsquo;ll just assume we&rsquo;re using one of those.  I realize that many of them are Open Source, which could complicate or help our situation.  I&rsquo;m going to call it a wash and ignore the whole situation for now.  Trust me, It&rsquo;s not that hard to get your hands on a good solid 2D engine for next to nothing.</p>\n<h3 id="5-the-game-is-state-of-the-art-as-far-as-2d-goes">5) The game is state-of-the-art, as far as 2D goes.</h3>\n<p>Yeah, I know.  The last time you read state-of-the-art and 2D in the same sentence was back in the early 90&rsquo;s.  The game will be fully animated and include wall-to-wall original music and full voice.  No corners will be cut in the quality of the production.</p>\n<p>Although some styles of art might be cheaper to produce than others, I don&rsquo;t think the savings is going to be dramatic.  We might want to go with a pre-rendered 3D look rather then the traditional 2D animation found in a lot of 2D adventure games.  Doing pre-rendered 3D might be a little more expensive because the tools tended to cost a lot, and 3D animators (as a rule) can be more expensive.  People argue that you end up saving because it&rsquo;s easier to animate once you have the models built, but I have not seen this to be true, but my experience is a little limited in this area.</p>\n<h3 id="6-were-going-to-build-the-game-in-a-year">6) We&rsquo;re going to build the game in a year.</h3>\n<p>For a classic point-n-click adventure, this is aggressive, but should be doable.  Monkey Island took less than a year.  We&rsquo;ll need a lot more art, but that&rsquo;s a production issue and can easily be made up for with more people to a certain extent.  We&rsquo;re also going to do a very rigorous pre-production, this will be essential in getting the game done on time and on budget.  Since we&rsquo;re dealing with known technology, this should be very predictable.</p>\n<h3 id="7-were-using-an-established-publisher-for-the-game-and-not-self-publishing">7) We&rsquo;re using an established publisher for the game, and not self-publishing.</h3>\n<p>Starting a company that will self-publish the game into retail channels is a huge undertaking and would require some significant capital.  Not impossible, but we&rsquo;d need money beyond the cost of development, and that is a whole different business plan.  It&rsquo;s also hard to become a retail based publisher with a single game.  You need several games to have any clout with the retailers.  We could do a distribution deal, but then we&rsquo;re significantly cutting into our profit.  As the last two sentences suggest, we&rsquo;re also assuming in-store distribution, online distribution will be covered later.</p>\n<h3 id="8-its-a-pc-game">8) It&rsquo;s a PC game</h3>\n<p>Dealing with the console manufactures on something like this would be a nightmare, plus the royalties you pay to them would kill us with a nitch game like this and it&rsquo;s just not the venue for these types of games.  At least not to start.</p>\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s roll up our sleeves, pull out our slide-rules and get down to business.</p>\n<h2 id="development-costs-and-plan">Development costs and plan</h2>\n<p>Staffing is the main expense, and is always a hotly debated topic.  Everyone has an opinion, and I&rsquo;m sure this will be no different.  Until a complete pre-production is done, it&rsquo;s hard to nail this cost down.  These figures are based on my experience building adventures at Humongous Entertainment and at my last company Hulabee Entertainment.  We probably built more 2D graphic adventure games than any other company in the world and we had a finely tuned production process.  Granted, these games were for kids, but that only affects the scope of the project.  If you&rsquo;ve ever played any of those games, you will understand what I mean.</p>\n<p>Remember, not everyone on this list would be on the project for the entire 12 months.  This creates some complications because you need to keep people around to ensure a skilled staff for the next game.  Hopefully we could get two games going in such a way that people would be moved off one project onto another.  One advantage the movie business has is an infrastructure to deal with production people coming and going from projects.  In the game business we don&rsquo;t have that.  But, I&rsquo;m going to ignore this issue for now.  We&rsquo;ll assume there are other projects to keep people busy and there is no down-time.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also going to assume the design and creative lead is either the lead programmer, lead artist, or both.</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer (will also deal with engine issues)\nLead Artist\nProducer</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $220,000</strong></p>\n<p>3 Programmers (in the scripting language)<br />\n5 Artists (skilled in 2D animation)\\</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $480,000</strong></p>\n<p>Testing</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $30,000</strong></p>\n<p>Other expenses that will be contracted out:</p>\n<p>Script\nMusic<br />\nSound<br />\nVoice talent (non-union)<br />\nVoice recording</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $60,000</strong></p>\n<p>The total cost for a 12 month project - including a standard 20% overhead for insurance, taxes, graft, paper-clips and a little rounding up - comes to:</p>\n<p><strong>Project Development Total: $950,000</strong></p>\n<p>Now, we can argue all day about how much we&rsquo;re paying people, whether someone is over or under payed, etc.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  My defense is that this comes from my direct experience in hiring people to do the exact same jobs.  We can certainly save some money by hiring talented people with no experience, and that often works very well, but I&rsquo;m assuming that at least half the people are experienced in the business.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve kept the team pretty lean.  It would be easy to dump the Producer, but that would be a huge mistake.  A good and talented Producer is gold.  We can also save a little money if the script or music is done by someone already on the team, but that will take them away from their other job and you have to ask yourself:  are they really the best person for the task?</p>\n<p>This cost is also just for development.  If we&rsquo;re going to fully evaluate the prospects of a 2D point-n-click adventure in today&rsquo;s market, we need to think about marketing costs on top of development.  Even if we use an established publisher, we&rsquo;re going to need to include this in order to evaluate the ROI (return on investment) that a publisher is going to look at.</p>\n<h2 id="marketing-costs">Marketing Costs</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s assume marketing costs comes in at $500,000.  This figure is probably about half of what it should be.  We can&rsquo;t just take out full page ads in the game rags and pepper the gaming sites with banner ads.  We&rsquo;re going to need a good solid grass-roots campaign.  If we&rsquo;re really clever we could get away with a number like this.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon to spend as much on marketing as it cost to develop the game.  The marketing budgets for mainstream console games reach $10 million and more, but since we&rsquo;re not doing console, we save the drain of TV ads.  We can also be clever with our PR and get the marketing costs down as much as possible.  Lots of PR will go a long way on the initial game, but once the novelty wears off (and competition begins), we&rsquo;ll have to spend marketing money.   As sad as it is, the best games don&rsquo;t always sell just because they are good.  It takes good marketing to be successful.  Never underestimate good marketing.</p>\n<p>One big area of concern here is if we&rsquo;re going through a publisher, we&rsquo;re going to have to rely on them being clever with marketing and PR.  That&rsquo;s a big risk.  Most publisher try and fit everything into a template.  We&rsquo;re going to need a publisher that is willing to think differently about this.  It&rsquo;s an important trait to be looking for as we hunt for a publisher.  But, as anyone who is pitching a 2D adventure game today will tell you, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of choices.</p>\n<p>I see this as the single-most risky part of this venture.</p>\n<p>For the first part of this evaluation, we&rsquo;re going to assume we&rsquo;re going through retail distribution.  In reality, this is the most likely scenario.  But more on that later.</p>\n<h1 id="retail-distribution">Retail Distribution</h1>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll do that math for three different price points, $19, $29 and $39.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s realistic to assume a $49 price.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure this is obvious to most everyone, but I&rsquo;ll point it out anyway.  The publisher does not get the full retail price of the game.  The stores have to make a profit as well.  The publisher sells the game to the retailer for what&rsquo;s called the Wholesale price.  The store can then sell the game for whatever they want, but for the most part, they use the following numbers:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Wholesale $15</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Wholesale $22</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Wholesale $30</strong></p>\n<p>There is also MDF (Marketing Development Funds) and co-op charges that the publisher needs to pay the retailer, and those typically run 6% of the Wholesale price billed quarterly, net of returns.  These cost go to cover in-store advertising, news-paper circulars, etc.  In addition, publishers also pay to have their games on &ldquo;end-caps&rdquo; or have special &ldquo;shelf-talkers&rdquo; (they don&rsquo;t really talk, thank-god, but I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s coming) that helps point out the product.  General rule of thumb is: if there is anything in the store that calls any attention to the game, it was paid for by the publisher.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll assume we&rsquo;re not going to pay for anything beyond the required co-op and MDF, but it might be a wise investment to buy some better placement.</p>\n<p>We also have the cost of the box, CD, manual, shipping, graft, etc.  This is called Cost of Goods, or COGs for short.  This will typically be $1.50 unless we want to throw some cool extra stuff in the box like we used to do in the olden-days.  Could be a good idea for the initial launch, if so, we&rsquo;ll bill that to marketing.</p>\n<p>There are also fees for outside sales commissions, distribution, EDI (electronic inventory management), inventory management, field merchandising, etc.  This will add another $1 to the cost of our game.</p>\n<p>We need to assume that we&rsquo;re going to get returns.  These might come from damaged product, customer returns, or games that the just don&rsquo;t sell.  We have to account for this, it&rsquo;s typically 20%.  As a side note, next time a store tells you they can&rsquo;t take a game back because the publisher won&rsquo;t take it back, call bullshit.  Of course, it&rsquo;s not as simple as the publisher giving the money back, it&rsquo;s typically done as credit, and it&rsquo;s often negotiated with respect to new games being bought from the publisher.  It is one of the reason that a single game publisher is going to have a hard time.</p>\n<p>So after all this, plus a little rounding, we&rsquo;re down to the following profit:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Profit $9</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Profit $18</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Profit $25</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s now time to calculate our break-even point.  That is the point that our publisher has made all their money back.  To do this, we divide the total cost of the project by the profit at each price-point.</p>\n<p>Our game cost $1,400,000 to build and (minimally) market, so to break-even we need to sell the following units at each price-point:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Break even units 155,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Break even units 75,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Break even units 56,000</strong></p>\n<p>Hmmmm&hellip;.</p>\n<p>There is quite a jump from the $19 to the $29 price point.  It will be tempting to try and sell it at $29, but with a game like this, we might need the lower price-point.  But the lower price point could leave some buyers with the feeling that the game isn&rsquo;t worth the full price, and that somethings wrong with it.  Game players are always screaming about wanting lower prices, but the truth is, if you lower the price too far, people stop buying it (unless it&rsquo;s a high profile game).</p>\n<p>155,000 or 75,000 units doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but our publisher is not in business to break-even, we&rsquo;re probably going to need to sell two or three times that.  Not every game we do is going to be a success, no matter how hard we try and how good we are.  If we&rsquo;re going to push some creative boundaries, we&rsquo;re going to need to experiment, and that&rsquo;s going to mean some failures.  We need to make a lot more then just break-even.  A publisher or investor is going to look at spending a dollar on this verses spending a dollar on something else.  This has to be a compelling option for them.  Break-even is not compelling.</p>\n<p><a href="http://people.freenet.de/lucasfangames/maniac/games_eng.htm">Maniac Mansion Deluxe</a>, the fan remake of Maniac Mansion, racked up over 200,000 downloads in a very short time, while it was free, it does show a strong interest.  How much of that was just &ldquo;nostalgia&rdquo; could be an important questions to answer.  How many of those people would spend $19 or $29 for a new game is another question I don&rsquo;t have the answer to.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at online distribution, after all, we are living in the futuristic year of 2004.</p>\n<h1 id="online-distribution">Online Distribution</h1>\n<p>Online has one big advantage:  It cuts out the middle-man, allowing us to get the full retail price of the game.  Online also has one big disadvantage: it cuts out the middle-man.  Having the game sit on a store shelf gets it in front of people eyes, it also gives it this sense of legitimacy, like a hardcover book does in the book publishing business.  The perception of shelf presence will vanish at some point, but it is a reality today.  There is a good reason why games like EverQuest are sold in stores and not exclusively online.</p>\n<p>If we only have an online presence, we need to do something to drive people to our website.  That&rsquo;s going to require more marketing, promotions, tie-ins, etc.  We can count on the buzz of our game being the first 2D point-n-click in fifty-years, but that is only in certain circles.  We need to reach beyond that.  It&rsquo;s also the kind of buzz that dies quickly.  If we plan on doing more than one game, we need some kind of sustainable way to get people back to our site.</p>\n<p>The issues surrounding marketing are not unique to online sales, just complicated by it being new and different.</p>\n<p>Online distribution is also not free.  Bandwidth costs money.  If we plan on the game being successful, we need servers and bandwidth able to handle huge simultaneous downloads.   With all the animation, voice, music, graft, etc, we could approach 1GB.  Nothing will kill our sales faster than willing customers that are unable to download the game at a reasonable speed.  Research I did several years ago into online distribution showed that, allowing for peak usage, bandwidth cost could run $5 per download.  A lot might have changed since then.  It was at the peak of the dot.com thingy.</p>\n<p>No doubt, someone will bring up BitTorrent and other P2P systems as a method of distribution.  Assuming that our purchasing model can deal with it, it is a good alternate way to get the game to people, but does it really hit all the people we want to be buying the game?  If we&rsquo;re trying to hit a broader audience, we need a fast, simple and direct way for them to download our game.</p>\n<p>System like Steam and even custom BitTorrent clients are very real possibilities, but they are risky and untested and will cost is time and money.  Publishers and investors don&rsquo;t like risk.  They are already taking a big one on the game, the fewer risky parts to our plan the better.</p>\n<p>With online distribution there are also issues with accepting credit cards, dealing with returns, unhappy customers, copy protection, unlock keys, graft, etc, etc, etc.</p>\n<p>We will also have to overcome the &ldquo;everything is free on the internet&rdquo; mentality.  Many companies have - so it&rsquo;s far from insurmountable - but it is an issue that needs to be considered.  Piracy is also a huge problem.  When you have a main-stream product, be it a game, music or a movie, you are some-what insulated from piracy because of high volume.  When you&rsquo;re dealing with a nitch market - like a 2D point-n-click would be - you are much more susceptible to the negative effects of piracy due to the smaller market and lower volume.</p>\n<p>Finding an online publisher would solve some of these problems (or shift them to someone more equipped to deal with them), but I have yet to find a online publisher willing to spend the kind of money we&rsquo;re needing for an online distributed game of this scale.  They are very much in the mindset of small webish games for the casual gamer.  In contrast, conventional publishers are used to spending larger sums of money on games.</p>\n<p>Online distribution seems great until you start to really look into it.  It&rsquo;s rife with issues, but shouldn&rsquo;t be discounted.  At the end of the day, we&rsquo;d probably settle on some of both.</p>\n<p>The last issue is developer royalties.</p>\n<h1 id="developer-royalties">Developer Royalties</h1>\n<p>If we go with a publisher, we are going to get a cut of the wholesale price.  We&rsquo;ll assume a rate of 20%.  It is also typical for the developer to recoup the development costs before any real money is paid out.  What is recoupment and how is it calculated?</p>\n<p>As a developer, we are &ldquo;loaned&rdquo; the money to build the game, in our case $950,000 (most publishers do not bill the developer for marketing, some do).  We need to pay that money back to the publisher.  When the game is sold, we get our 20% of the Wholesale price, but we have to pay back our loan, so we won&rsquo;t get any money until our royalties have reached $950,000.</p>\n<p>To calculate the developers break-even, we take the $950,000 we &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; and divide that by 20% of the wholesale price.  So for the developer to start making money, the game needs to sell the following units at each price point:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Developer break even units 320,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Developer break even units 220,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Developer break even units 160,000</strong></p>\n<p>Double Hmmmm&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Whether the whole developer royalty model is fair or not is not the point of this article, so let&rsquo;s not get side-tracked on that.  It&rsquo;s the way the industry works, and we&rsquo;ll have to live with it until the armed revolution of 2007.  As the date approaches, keep checking this site for instructions.</p>\n<h2 id="some-final-thoughts">Some final thoughts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember, this thought-experiment was about building a modern 2D adventure game in today&rsquo;s market.  There are a lot of other styles of games that can be made cheaper.  Stay focused.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of issues and sub-issues I have not talked about, or only briefly touch upon, so this should not be used as anything other than a conversation starter.</li>\n<li>There are an endless number of cheap ways to do marketing and ways to cut development cost.  If this was a real business plan, all those would be thoroughly thought through.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of alternate distribution models that we could explore beyond the traditional retail sales and emerging online.  We could do it as shareware, advertising funded, bundled with cereal, etc.  The list is endless, but they are also risky and unlikely to get us the funding to build the game.  For this thought experiment, we&rsquo;re trying to build a viable business likely to get funding from an investor or publisher.</li>\n<li>Anyone attempting this is going to have to find a publisher (or become a publisher) that is willing to put out several games before evaluating the success of the venture.  It&rsquo;s going to take a few really good games before this catches on.  If our publisher (or we) gives up after an initial failure, it will never succeed.  A longer term vision is needed.</li>\n<li>We need to expand the audience beyond the current 2D adventure fan base.  While this is a large and dedicated group, it needs to be larger and growing.  We need to appeal (with the game and the marketing) to a new set of people who are not exclusively interested in high-testosterone 3D gaming.  Games like Grim Fandango had a very wide appeal, but were miss-marketed and abandoned to quickly.</li>\n<li>We should build a Mac and possibly a Linux version of the game.  We need every channel we can get.  Linux poses some problems (perceptionally and technically), but they are worth solving.  I have not thought a lot about the Linux issues, they might be simple.</li>\n<li>We&rsquo;re going to need to come up with truly innovative stories and modern game play.  We can&rsquo;t just mimic the adventure games of the past.  We have some huge graphic perceptions to overcome, at least as a first impression.  Everyone talks about game-play being king.  We would need to prove it.</li>\n<li>We should think about a licensed property, but the economics of it probably don&rsquo;t make any sense.  And it&rsquo;s not as much fun.</li>\n<li>There is not going to be a lot of profit on the back-end.  While we do need to build a viable business, in the end of the day, it&rsquo;s got to be something we love, because it&rsquo;s not going to be much more than a paycheck.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fun to think about&hellip;</p>\n<p>Now everyone back to the salt-mines&hellip;</p>'}}

It is now the futuristic year of 2004 and we are all driving around in flying cars and wearing sliver jumps suits.  A lot has changed for Adventure Games as well, but unfortunately not in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Adventure Games are officially dead.  I think this <a href="http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/77.html">article from Old Man Murray</a> (written in 2002) sums it up pretty well.  Make sure you read the whole thing, it starts out slow, but his conclusion could not be more true.</p>\n<p>Some people will tell you that Adventure Games aren&rsquo;t really dead, they have just morphed into other forms, or that other genres have absorbed Adventure Games.  If this is true, they&rsquo;ve done a pretty bad job of it.</p>\n<p>I wrote this article to help fellow Adventure Games designers back in 1989, but the RPG, FPS and RTS designers of 2004 could use a little of the self-proclaimed wisdom of the past.</p>\n<p>As I read this some 15 years later, I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with everything in here anymore.  I learned a lot from Monkey Island 1 and 2, plus countless kids Adventure Games at Humongous Entertainment.  At some point in the near future, I will do an annotated version of this article, talking about things that have changed, or were just plains wrong.  But in the meantime, there is something interesting on TV right now.</p>\n<p>I would also like to thank <a href="http://electriceggplant.com">David Fox</a> for passively-aggressively forcing me to post this.</p>\n<h2 id="why-adventure-games-suck-and-what-we-can-do-about-it">Why Adventure Games Suck And What We Can Do About It</h2>\n<p>Copyright 1989, Ron Gilbert</p>\n<p>Of all the different types of games, the ones I most enjoy playing are adventure/story games.  It is no surprise that this is also the genre for which I design.  I enjoy games in which the pace is slow and the reward is for thinking and figuring, rather than quick reflexes.  The element that brings adventure games to life for me is the stories around which they are woven.  When done right, it is a form of storytelling that can be engrossing in a way that only interaction can bring.  The key here is &ldquo;done right&rdquo;, which it seldom is.</p>\n<p>One of my pet peeves is the recent trend to call story games &ldquo;Interactive Movies.&rdquo;  They are interactive, but they are not movies.  The fact that people want to call them movies just points out how lost we are.  What we need to do is to establish a genre for our works that we can call our own.  Movies came from stage plays, but the references are long lost and movies have come into their own.  The same thing needs to happen to story games.</p>\n<p>The desire to call them Interactive Movies comes from a couple of places.  The first is Marketing.  It is the goal of narrow-minded marketing to place everything into a category so it will be recognizable.  These people feel that the closest things to story games are movies.  The other source for the name Interactive Movie is what I call &ldquo;Hollywood Envy.&rdquo;  A great number of people in this business secretly (and not so secretly) wish they were making movies, not writing video games.  Knock it off!  If you really want to make movies, then go to film school and leave the game designing to people who want to make games.</p>\n<p>Story games are not movies, but the two forms do share a great deal.  It is not fair to completely ignore movies.  We can learn a lot from them about telling stories in a visual medium.  However, it is important to realize that there are many more differences than similarities.  We have to choose what to borrow and what to discover for ourselves.</p>\n<p>The single biggest difference is interaction.  You can&rsquo;t interact with a movie.  You just sit in the theater and watch it.  In a story game, the player is given the freedom to explore the story.  But the player doesn&rsquo;t always do what the designer intended, and this causes problems.  It is hard to create a cohesive plot when you have no idea what part of the story the player will trip over next.  This problem calls for a special kind of storytelling, and we have just begun to scratch the surface of this art form.</p>\n<p>There is a state of mind called &ldquo;suspension of disbelief&rdquo;.  When you are watching a movie, or reading a good book, your mind falls into this state.  It occurs when you are pulled so completely into the story that you no longer realize you are in a movie theater or sitting at your couch, reading.  When the story starts to drag, or the plots begins to fall apart, the suspension of disbelief is lost.  You soon start looking around the theater, noticing the people in front of you or the green exit sign.  One way I judge a movie is by the number of times I realized I was in a theater.</p>\n<p>The same is true of story games (as well as almost all other kinds of games).  As the story builds, we are pulled into the game and leave the real world behind.  As designers, our job is to keep people in this state for as long as possible.  Every time the player has to restore a saved game, or pound his head on the desk in frustration, the suspension of disbelief is gone.  At this time he is most likely to shut off the computer and go watch TV, at which point we all have lost.</p>\n<p>I have created a set of rules of thumb that will minimize the loss of suspension of disbelief.  As with any set of rules, there are always exceptions.  In my designs, I hope that if these rules cannot be followed, it is for artistic reasons and not because I am too lazy to do it right.  In Maniac Mansion, in one place or another, I violated all but one of these rules.  Some of them were violated by design, others by sloppiness.  If I could redesign Maniac Mansion, all the violations would be removed and I&rsquo;d have a much better game.</p>\n<p>Some people say that following these rules makes the games too easy to play.  I disagree.  What makes most games tough to play is that the puzzles are arbitrary and unconnected.  Most are solved by chance or repetitive sessions of typing &ldquo;light candle with match&rdquo;, &ldquo;light paper with match&rdquo;, &ldquo;light rug with match&rdquo;, until something happens.  This is not tough game play, this is masturbation.  I played one game that required the player to drop a bubble gum wrapper in a room in order to get a trap door to open (object names have been changed to protect the guilty).  What is the reasoning?  There is none.  It&rsquo;s an advanced puzzle, I was told.</p>\n<p>Here, then, are Gilbert&rsquo;s Rules of Thumb:</p>\n<h2 id="end-objective-needs-to-be-clear">End objective needs to be clear</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s OK if the objective changes in mid-game, but at the beginning the player should have a clear vision as to what he or she is trying to accomplish.  Nothing is more frustrating than wandering around wondering what you should be doing and if what you have been doing is going to get you anywhere.  Situations where not knowing what&rsquo;s going on can be fun and an integral part of the game, but this is rare and difficult to pull off.</p>\n<h2 id="sub-goals-need-to-be-obvious">Sub-goals need to be obvious</h2>\n<p>Most good adventure games are broken up into many sub-goals.  Letting the player know at least the first sub-goal is essential in hooking them.  If the main goal is to rescue the prince, and the player is trapped on an island at the beginning of the game, have another character in the story tell them the first step: get off the island.  This is just good storytelling.  Ben Kenobi pretty much laid out Luke&rsquo;s whole journey in the first twenty minutes of Star Wars.  This provided a way for the audience to follow the progress of the main character.  For someone not used to the repetitive head-banging of adventure games, this simple clue can mean the difference between finishing the game and giving up after the first hour.  It&rsquo;s very easy when designing to become blind to what the player doesn&rsquo;t know about your story.</p>\n<h2 id="live-and-learn">Live and learn</h2>\n<p>As a rule, adventure games should be able to be played from beginning to end without &ldquo;dying&rdquo; or saving the game if the player is very careful and very observant.  It is bad design to put puzzles and situations into a game that require a player to die in order to learn what not to do next time.  This is not to say that all death situations should be designed out.  Danger is inherent in drama, but danger should be survivable if the player is clever.</p>\n<p>As an exercise, take one complete path through a story game and then tell it to someone else, as if it were a standard story.  If you find places where the main character could not have known a piece of information that was used (the character who learned it died in a previous game), then there is a hole in the plot.</p>\n<h2 id="backwards-puzzles">Backwards Puzzles</h2>\n<p>The backwards puzzle is probably the one thing that bugs me more than anything else about adventure games.  I have created my share of them; and as with most design flaws, it&rsquo;s easier to leave them in than to redesign them.  The backwards puzzle occurs when the solution is found before the problem.  Ideally, the crevice should be found before the rope that allows the player to descend.  What this does in the player&rsquo;s mind is set up a challenge.  He knows he need to get down the crevice, but there is no route.  Now the player has a task in mind as he continues to search.  When a rope is spotted, a light goes on in his head and the puzzle falls into place.  For a player, when the design works, there is nothing like that experience.</p>\n<h2 id="i-forgot-to-pick-it-up">I forgot to pick it up</h2>\n<p>This is really part of the backwards puzzle rule, but in the worst way.  Never require a player to pick up an item that is used later in the game if she can&rsquo;t go back and get it when it is needed.  It is very frustrating to learn that a seemingly insignificant object is needed, and the only way to get it is to start over or go back to a saved game.  From the player&rsquo;s point of view, there was no reason for picking it up in the first place.  Some designers have actually defended this practice by saying that, &ldquo;adventure games players know to pick up everything.&rdquo;  This is a cop-out.  If the jar of water needs to be used on the spaceship and it can only be found on the planet, create a use for it on the planet that guarantees it will be picked up.  If the time between the two uses is long enough, you can be almost guaranteed that the player forgot she even had the object.</p>\n<p>The other way around this problem is to give the player hints about what she might need to pick up.  If the aliens on the planet suggest that the player find water before returning to the ship, and the player ignores this advice, then failure is her own fault.</p>\n<h2 id="puzzles-should-advance-the-story">Puzzles should advance the story</h2>\n<p>There is nothing more frustrating than solving pointless puzzle after pointless puzzle.  Each puzzle solved should bring the player closer to understanding the story and game.  It should be somewhat clear how solving this puzzle brings the player closer to the immediate goal.  What a waste of time and energy for the designer and player if all the puzzle does is slow the progress of the game.</p>\n<h2 id="real-time-is-bad-drama">Real time is bad drama</h2>\n<p>One of the most important keys to drama is timing.  Anyone who has designed a story game knows that the player rarely does anything at the right time or in the right order.  If we let the game run on a clock that is independent from the player&rsquo;s actions, we are going to be guaranteed that few things will happen with dramatic timing.  When Indiana Jones rolled under the closing stone door and grabbed his hat just in time, it sent a chill and a cheer through everyone in the audience.  If that scene had been done in a standard adventure game, the player would have been killed the first four times he tried to make it under the door.  The next six times the player would have been too late to grab the hat.  Is this good drama?  Not likely.  The key is to use Hollywood time, not real time.  Give the player some slack when doing time-based puzzles.  Try to watch for intent.  If the player is working towards the solution and almost ready to complete it, wait.  Wait until the hat is grabbed, then slam the door down.  The player thinks they &ldquo;just made it&rdquo; and consequently a much greater number of players get the rush and excitement.  When designing time puzzles I like to divide the time into three categories.  10% of the players will do the puzzle so fast and efficiently that they will finish with time to spare.  Another 10% will take too much time and fail, which leaves 80% of the people to brush through in the nick of time.</p>\n<h2 id="incremental-reward">Incremental reward</h2>\n<p>The player needs to know that she is achieving.  The fastest way to turn a player off is to let the game drag on with no advancement.  This is especially true for people who are playing adventure games for the first time.  In graphics adventures the reward often comes in the form of seeing new areas of the game.  New graphics and characters are often all that is needed to keep people playing.  Of course, if we are trying to tell a story, then revealing new plot elements and twists can be of equal or greater value.</p>\n<h2 id="arbitrary-puzzles">Arbitrary puzzles</h2>\n<p>Puzzles and their solutions need to make sense.  They don&rsquo;t have to be obvious, just make sense.  The best reaction after solving a tough puzzle should be, &ldquo;Of course, why didn&rsquo;t I think of that sooner!&rdquo;  The worst, and most often heard after being told the solution is, &ldquo;I never would have gotten that!&rdquo;  If the solution can only be reached by trial and error or plain luck, it&rsquo;s a bad puzzle.</p>\n<h2 id="reward-intent">Reward Intent</h2>\n<p>The object of these games is to have fun.  Figure out what the player is trying to do.  If it is what the game wants, then help the player along and let it happen.  The most common place this fails is in playing a meta-game called &ldquo;second guess the parser.&rdquo;  If there is an object on the screen that looks like a box, but the parser is waiting for it to be called a mailbox, the player is going to spend a lot of time trying to get the game to do a task that should be transparent.  In parser-driven games, the key is to have lots of synonyms for objects.  If the game is a graphics adventure, check proximity of the player&rsquo;s character.  If the player is standing right next to something, chances are they are trying to manipulate it.  If you give the player the benefit of the doubt, the game will be right more than wrong.  On one occasion, I don&rsquo;t know how much time I spent trying to tie a string on the end of a stick.  I finally gave up, not knowing if I was wording the sentence wrong or if it was not part of the design.  As it turned out, I was wording it wrong.</p>\n<h2 id="unconnected-events">Unconnected events</h2>\n<p>In order to pace events, some games lock out sections until certain events have happened.  There is nothing wrong with this, it is almost a necessity.  The problem comes when the event that opens the new section of the world is unconnected.  If the designer wants to make sure that six objects have been picked up before opening a secret door, make sure that there is a reason why those six objects would affect the door.  If a player has only picked up five of the objects and is waiting for the door to open (or worse yet, trying to find a way to open the door), the act of getting the flashlight is not going to make any sense in relation to the door opening.</p>\n<h2 id="give-the-player-options">Give the player options</h2>\n<p>A lot of story games employ a technique that can best be described as caging the player.  This occurs when the player is required to solve a small set of puzzles in order to advance to the next section of the game, at which point she is presented with another small set of puzzles.  Once these puzzles are solved, in a seemingly endless series of cages, the player enters the next section.  This can be particularly frustrating if the player is unable to solve a particular puzzle.  The areas to explore tend to be small, so the only activity is walking around trying to find the one solution out.</p>\n<p>Try to imagine this type of puzzle as a cage the player is caught in, and the only way out is to find the key.  Once the key is found, the player finds herself in another cage.  A better way to approach designing this is to think of the player as outside the cages, and the puzzles as locked up within.  In this model, the player has a lot more options about what to do next.  She can select from a wide variety of cages to open.  If the solution to one puzzle stumps her, she can go on to another, thus increasing the amount of useful activity going on.</p>\n<p>Of course, you will want some puzzles that lock out areas of the game, but the areas should be fairly large and interesting unto themselves.  A good indicator of the cage syndrome is how linear the game is.  If the plot follows a very strict line, chances are the designer is caging the player along the path.  It&rsquo;s not easy to uncage a game, it requires some careful attention to the plot as seen from players coming at the story from different directions.  The easiest way is to create different interactions for a given situation depending on the order encountered.</p>\n<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If I could change the world, there are a few things I would do, and quite frankly none of them have anything to do with computers or games.  But since this article is about games?</p>\n<p>The first thing I&rsquo;d do is get rid of save games.  If there have to be save games, I would use them only when it was time to quit playing until the next day.  Save games should not be a part of game play.  This leads to sloppy design.  As a challenge, think about how you would design a game differently if there were no save games.  If you ever have the pleasure of watching a non-gameplayer playing an adventure game you will notice they treat save game very differently then the experienced user.  Some start using it as a defense mechanism only after being slapped in the face by the game a few times, the rest just stop playing.</p>\n<p>The second thing I&rsquo;d change would be the price.  For between forty and fifty dollars a game, people expect a lot of play for their money.  This rarely leads to huge, deep games, but rather time-wasting puzzles and mazes.  If the designer ever thinks the game might be too short, he throws in another puzzle or two.  These also tend to be the worst thought-out and most painful to solve.  If I could have my way, I&rsquo;d design games that were meant to be played in four to five hours.  The games would be of the same scope that I currently design, I&rsquo;d just remove the silly time-wasting puzzles and take the player for an intense ride.  The experience they would leave with would be much more entertaining and a lot less frustrating.  The games would still be challenging, but not at the expense of the players patience.</p>\n<p>If any type of game is going to bridge the gap between games and storytelling, it is most likely going to be adventure games.  They will become less puzzle solving and more story telling, it is the blueprint the future will be made from.  The thing we cannot forget is that we are here to entertain, and for most people, entertainment does not consist of nights and weekends filled with frustration.  The average American spends most of the day failing at the office, the last thing he wants to do is come home and fail while trying to relax and be entertained.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/IMG_1280.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote this back in 1989 while I was designing Monkey Island.  It is now the futuristic year of 2004 and we are all driving around in flying cars and wearing sliver jumps suits.  A lot has changed for Adventure Games as well, but unfortunately not in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Adventure Games are officially dead.  I think this <a href="http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/77.html">article from Old Man Murray</a> (written in 2002) sums it up pretty well.  Make sure you read the whole thing, it starts out slow, but his conclusion could not be more true.</p>\n<p>Some people will tell you that Adventure Games aren&rsquo;t really dead, they have just morphed into other forms, or that other genres have absorbed Adventure Games.  If this is true, they&rsquo;ve done a pretty bad job of it.</p>\n<p>I wrote this article to help fellow Adventure Games designers back in 1989, but the RPG, FPS and RTS designers of 2004 could use a little of the self-proclaimed wisdom of the past.</p>\n<p>As I read this some 15 years later, I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with everything in here anymore.  I learned a lot from Monkey Island 1 and 2, plus countless kids Adventure Games at Humongous Entertainment.  At some point in the near future, I will do an annotated version of this article, talking about things that have changed, or were just plains wrong.  But in the meantime, there is something interesting on TV right now.</p>\n<p>I would also like to thank <a href="http://electriceggplant.com">David Fox</a> for passively-aggressively forcing me to post this.</p>\n<h2 id="why-adventure-games-suck-and-what-we-can-do-about-it">Why Adventure Games Suck And What We Can Do About It</h2>\n<p>Copyright 1989, Ron Gilbert</p>\n<p>Of all the different types of games, the ones I most enjoy playing are adventure/story games.  It is no surprise that this is also the genre for which I design.  I enjoy games in which the pace is slow and the reward is for thinking and figuring, rather than quick reflexes.  The element that brings adventure games to life for me is the stories around which they are woven.  When done right, it is a form of storytelling that can be engrossing in a way that only interaction can bring.  The key here is &ldquo;done right&rdquo;, which it seldom is.</p>\n<p>One of my pet peeves is the recent trend to call story games &ldquo;Interactive Movies.&rdquo;  They are interactive, but they are not movies.  The fact that people want to call them movies just points out how lost we are.  What we need to do is to establish a genre for our works that we can call our own.  Movies came from stage plays, but the references are long lost and movies have come into their own.  The same thing needs to happen to story games.</p>\n<p>The desire to call them Interactive Movies comes from a couple of places.  The first is Marketing.  It is the goal of narrow-minded marketing to place everything into a category so it will be recognizable.  These people feel that the closest things to story games are movies.  The other source for the name Interactive Movie is what I call &ldquo;Hollywood Envy.&rdquo;  A great number of people in this business secretly (and not so secretly) wish they were making movies, not writing video games.  Knock it off!  If you really want to make movies, then go to film school and leave the game designing to people who want to make games.</p>\n<p>Story games are not movies, but the two forms do share a great deal.  It is not fair to completely ignore movies.  We can learn a lot from them about telling stories in a visual medium.  However, it is important to realize that there are many more differences than similarities.  We have to choose what to borrow and what to discover for ourselves.</p>\n<p>The single biggest difference is interaction.  You can&rsquo;t interact with a movie.  You just sit in the theater and watch it.  In a story game, the player is given the freedom to explore the story.  But the player doesn&rsquo;t always do what the designer intended, and this causes problems.  It is hard to create a cohesive plot when you have no idea what part of the story the player will trip over next.  This problem calls for a special kind of storytelling, and we have just begun to scratch the surface of this art form.</p>\n<p>There is a state of mind called &ldquo;suspension of disbelief&rdquo;.  When you are watching a movie, or reading a good book, your mind falls into this state.  It occurs when you are pulled so completely into the story that you no longer realize you are in a movie theater or sitting at your couch, reading.  When the story starts to drag, or the plots begins to fall apart, the suspension of disbelief is lost.  You soon start looking around the theater, noticing the people in front of you or the green exit sign.  One way I judge a movie is by the number of times I realized I was in a theater.</p>\n<p>The same is true of story games (as well as almost all other kinds of games).  As the story builds, we are pulled into the game and leave the real world behind.  As designers, our job is to keep people in this state for as long as possible.  Every time the player has to restore a saved game, or pound his head on the desk in frustration, the suspension of disbelief is gone.  At this time he is most likely to shut off the computer and go watch TV, at which point we all have lost.</p>\n<p>I have created a set of rules of thumb that will minimize the loss of suspension of disbelief.  As with any set of rules, there are always exceptions.  In my designs, I hope that if these rules cannot be followed, it is for artistic reasons and not because I am too lazy to do it right.  In Maniac Mansion, in one place or another, I violated all but one of these rules.  Some of them were violated by design, others by sloppiness.  If I could redesign Maniac Mansion, all the violations would be removed and I&rsquo;d have a much better game.</p>\n<p>Some people say that following these rules makes the games too easy to play.  I disagree.  What makes most games tough to play is that the puzzles are arbitrary and unconnected.  Most are solved by chance or repetitive sessions of typing &ldquo;light candle with match&rdquo;, &ldquo;light paper with match&rdquo;, &ldquo;light rug with match&rdquo;, until something happens.  This is not tough game play, this is masturbation.  I played one game that required the player to drop a bubble gum wrapper in a room in order to get a trap door to open (object names have been changed to protect the guilty).  What is the reasoning?  There is none.  It&rsquo;s an advanced puzzle, I was told.</p>\n<p>Here, then, are Gilbert&rsquo;s Rules of Thumb:</p>\n<h2 id="end-objective-needs-to-be-clear">End objective needs to be clear</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s OK if the objective changes in mid-game, but at the beginning the player should have a clear vision as to what he or she is trying to accomplish.  Nothing is more frustrating than wandering around wondering what you should be doing and if what you have been doing is going to get you anywhere.  Situations where not knowing what&rsquo;s going on can be fun and an integral part of the game, but this is rare and difficult to pull off.</p>\n<h2 id="sub-goals-need-to-be-obvious">Sub-goals need to be obvious</h2>\n<p>Most good adventure games are broken up into many sub-goals.  Letting the player know at least the first sub-goal is essential in hooking them.  If the main goal is to rescue the prince, and the player is trapped on an island at the beginning of the game, have another character in the story tell them the first step: get off the island.  This is just good storytelling.  Ben Kenobi pretty much laid out Luke&rsquo;s whole journey in the first twenty minutes of Star Wars.  This provided a way for the audience to follow the progress of the main character.  For someone not used to the repetitive head-banging of adventure games, this simple clue can mean the difference between finishing the game and giving up after the first hour.  It&rsquo;s very easy when designing to become blind to what the player doesn&rsquo;t know about your story.</p>\n<h2 id="live-and-learn">Live and learn</h2>\n<p>As a rule, adventure games should be able to be played from beginning to end without &ldquo;dying&rdquo; or saving the game if the player is very careful and very observant.  It is bad design to put puzzles and situations into a game that require a player to die in order to learn what not to do next time.  This is not to say that all death situations should be designed out.  Danger is inherent in drama, but danger should be survivable if the player is clever.</p>\n<p>As an exercise, take one complete path through a story game and then tell it to someone else, as if it were a standard story.  If you find places where the main character could not have known a piece of information that was used (the character who learned it died in a previous game), then there is a hole in the plot.</p>\n<h2 id="backwards-puzzles">Backwards Puzzles</h2>\n<p>The backwards puzzle is probably the one thing that bugs me more than anything else about adventure games.  I have created my share of them; and as with most design flaws, it&rsquo;s easier to leave them in than to redesign them.  The backwards puzzle occurs when the solution is found before the problem.  Ideally, the crevice should be found before the rope that allows the player to descend.  What this does in the player&rsquo;s mind is set up a challenge.  He knows he need to get down the crevice, but there is no route.  Now the player has a task in mind as he continues to search.  When a rope is spotted, a light goes on in his head and the puzzle falls into place.  For a player, when the design works, there is nothing like that experience.</p>\n<h2 id="i-forgot-to-pick-it-up">I forgot to pick it up</h2>\n<p>This is really part of the backwards puzzle rule, but in the worst way.  Never require a player to pick up an item that is used later in the game if she can&rsquo;t go back and get it when it is needed.  It is very frustrating to learn that a seemingly insignificant object is needed, and the only way to get it is to start over or go back to a saved game.  From the player&rsquo;s point of view, there was no reason for picking it up in the first place.  Some designers have actually defended this practice by saying that, &ldquo;adventure games players know to pick up everything.&rdquo;  This is a cop-out.  If the jar of water needs to be used on the spaceship and it can only be found on the planet, create a use for it on the planet that guarantees it will be picked up.  If the time between the two uses is long enough, you can be almost guaranteed that the player forgot she even had the object.</p>\n<p>The other way around this problem is to give the player hints about what she might need to pick up.  If the aliens on the planet suggest that the player find water before returning to the ship, and the player ignores this advice, then failure is her own fault.</p>\n<h2 id="puzzles-should-advance-the-story">Puzzles should advance the story</h2>\n<p>There is nothing more frustrating than solving pointless puzzle after pointless puzzle.  Each puzzle solved should bring the player closer to understanding the story and game.  It should be somewhat clear how solving this puzzle brings the player closer to the immediate goal.  What a waste of time and energy for the designer and player if all the puzzle does is slow the progress of the game.</p>\n<h2 id="real-time-is-bad-drama">Real time is bad drama</h2>\n<p>One of the most important keys to drama is timing.  Anyone who has designed a story game knows that the player rarely does anything at the right time or in the right order.  If we let the game run on a clock that is independent from the player&rsquo;s actions, we are going to be guaranteed that few things will happen with dramatic timing.  When Indiana Jones rolled under the closing stone door and grabbed his hat just in time, it sent a chill and a cheer through everyone in the audience.  If that scene had been done in a standard adventure game, the player would have been killed the first four times he tried to make it under the door.  The next six times the player would have been too late to grab the hat.  Is this good drama?  Not likely.  The key is to use Hollywood time, not real time.  Give the player some slack when doing time-based puzzles.  Try to watch for intent.  If the player is working towards the solution and almost ready to complete it, wait.  Wait until the hat is grabbed, then slam the door down.  The player thinks they &ldquo;just made it&rdquo; and consequently a much greater number of players get the rush and excitement.  When designing time puzzles I like to divide the time into three categories.  10% of the players will do the puzzle so fast and efficiently that they will finish with time to spare.  Another 10% will take too much time and fail, which leaves 80% of the people to brush through in the nick of time.</p>\n<h2 id="incremental-reward">Incremental reward</h2>\n<p>The player needs to know that she is achieving.  The fastest way to turn a player off is to let the game drag on with no advancement.  This is especially true for people who are playing adventure games for the first time.  In graphics adventures the reward often comes in the form of seeing new areas of the game.  New graphics and characters are often all that is needed to keep people playing.  Of course, if we are trying to tell a story, then revealing new plot elements and twists can be of equal or greater value.</p>\n<h2 id="arbitrary-puzzles">Arbitrary puzzles</h2>\n<p>Puzzles and their solutions need to make sense.  They don&rsquo;t have to be obvious, just make sense.  The best reaction after solving a tough puzzle should be, &ldquo;Of course, why didn&rsquo;t I think of that sooner!&rdquo;  The worst, and most often heard after being told the solution is, &ldquo;I never would have gotten that!&rdquo;  If the solution can only be reached by trial and error or plain luck, it&rsquo;s a bad puzzle.</p>\n<h2 id="reward-intent">Reward Intent</h2>\n<p>The object of these games is to have fun.

There is nothing wrong with this, it is almost a necessity.  The problem comes when the event that opens the new section of the world is unconnected.

This is unusual as generally, large companies strive for the opposite, to go public. You hear about things going the other way a lot less often, never mind with such a large sum of money changing hands.</p><p>I wasn\'t sure whether I should write about this on the blog because I\'m not really an expert on all this business stuff. People who seem more knowledgeable on the subject mostly seem to think that this will enrich a certain number of individuals while ultimately being bad for EA itself, likely leading to a lot of lay-offs and perhaps even bankruptcy further down the line. So not great news for fans of Bioware games and the like.</p><p>However, many of the comments I\'ve read on social media about how this is likely to affect SWTOR have been so utterly hyperbolic and divorced from reality, I feel we need to clarify some things. Remember, The Old Republic is NOT a Bioware game anymore, not in the technical sense anyway.&nbsp;<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/annnd-its-official.html" target="_blank">It\'s being developed by Broadsword</a>!</p><p>Also, if you read the article linked at the top, the transaction "is expected to close in Q1 FY27" so nothing\'s happening as a result of this for at least another year.</p><p>Whatever <i>is</i> going to happen as the result of this buyout eventually, I do not believe we have reason to worry about SWTOR in specific. Keep in mind that SWTOR isn\'t something that EA wholly owns; it\'s a collaborative project between Disney, Broadsword and EA.</p><p>Disney may be making the smallest contribution at this point (unless they are secretly responsible for a lot of the investment in the game) but they are actually the ones with the ultimate power due to owning the Star Wars IP. They could theoretically cause the game to shut down at any time by saying "we no longer want this to represent Star Wars" and that would be it. You can\'t take the Star Wars out of SWTOR and still have a game. This seems unlikely to be a problem though as based on various dev interviews, the Disney peeps seem to love the game and are quite happy with the work the devs have been doing with it.</p><p>The interaction between Broadsword and EA is a lot less clear.

This is unusual as generally, large companies strive for the opposite, to go public. You hear about things going the other way a lot less often, never mind with such a large sum of money changing hands.</p><p>I wasn\'t sure whether I should write about this on the blog because I\'m not really an expert on all this business stuff. People who seem more knowledgeable on the subject mostly seem to think that this will enrich a certain number of individuals while ultimately being bad for EA itself, likely leading to a lot of lay-offs and perhaps even bankruptcy further down the line. So not great news for fans of Bioware games and the like.</p><p>However, many of the comments I\'ve read on social media about how this is likely to affect SWTOR have been so utterly hyperbolic and divorced from reality, I feel we need to clarify some things. Remember, The Old Republic is NOT a Bioware game anymore, not in the technical sense anyway.&nbsp;<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/annnd-its-official.html" target="_blank">It\'s being developed by Broadsword</a>!</p><p>Also, if you read the article linked at the top, the transaction "is expected to close in Q1 FY27" so nothing\'s happening as a result of this for at least another year.</p><p>Whatever <i>is</i> going to happen as the result of this buyout eventually, I do not believe we have reason to worry about SWTOR in specific. Keep in mind that SWTOR isn\'t something that EA wholly owns; it\'s a collaborative project between Disney, Broadsword and EA.</p><p>Disney may be making the smallest contribution at this point (unless they are secretly responsible for a lot of the investment in the game) but they are actually the ones with the ultimate power due to owning the Star Wars IP. They could theoretically cause the game to shut down at any time by saying "we no longer want this to represent Star Wars" and that would be it. You can\'t take the Star Wars out of SWTOR and still have a game. This seems unlikely to be a problem though as based on various dev interviews, the Disney peeps seem to love the game and are quite happy with the work the devs have been doing with it.</p><p>The interaction between Broadsword and EA is a lot less clear.

I wish I could credit the original artist (Minicrit?) with a link, but alas, RIP Google Plus. </i><br /></p><p><b>The big PvP debacle on original Ilum</b></p><p>Another thing that made headlines around launch was the planet Ilum and the PvP taking place there. You see, the western ice shelf where the Gree visit nowadays used to be a dedicated PvP area. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JNT33oSXjE" target="_blank">This brief video by Force Gaming</a> should give you an idea of how it was <i>supposed</i> to work. It was released about two weeks after launch, and the video notes that at the time, people were just flipping objectives and not much PvP was going on. This was "fixed" with a patch... that in turn <a href="https://spinksville.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/swtor-the-oops-we-just-broke-high-level-world-pvp-patch/" target="_blank">broke the area in a whole bunch of other ways</a>. The result were crazy AoE fests that the game\'s engine couldn\'t deal with very well, which caused people to gain valour way too fast, even as they were just dying over and over in the mayhem. It was just chaos and caused endless complaints.</p><p>Once again, this is something I didn\'t actually get to experience directly, as I took my time levelling and didn\'t get to Ilum until about three months later, by which time all the craziness had already died down. In January 2013, I actually wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-strangeness-of-ilum-year-later.html">The strangeness of Ilum a year later</a>", but in those first weeks after launch, it was seemingly all people would talk about on forums and news sites, about how this newly launched MMO clearly didn\'t know how to deal with PvP and was therefore already failing horribly.</p><p><b>The original Rakghoul event</b></p><p>The recurring Rakghoul Resurgence event is probably old hat to most of you at this point - just another world event that comes around every so often and which has been around for what feels like forever. The very first Rakghoul event in April 2012 though... that was something else. The activities it came with weren\'t really any more exciting than what we have in the repeating event, but the vibe was very different and unique, mainly because we had no idea it was coming.</p><p>The game was still very new at the time, had a lot going on and we were getting patches and updates about more patches all the time... but this came as a complete surprise, and the experience of everyone being confused about what was going on and slowly figuring things out over the course of the first day was unique and exciting in a way that I think is hard to convey nowadays. You can read <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/world-event.html">the blog post I wrote about it at the time</a> to get an idea though. (I also wrote <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-plague-day-4.html">two</a> <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-event-end.html">follow-ups</a>.)</p><p>Ultimately the fact that it was a time-limited one-off was also one of the biggest criticisms Bioware received, which is why they eventually swapped to making new events recurring. The Rakghouls would eventually join the rotation in <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-rakghouls-are-here.html">early 2014</a>.</p><p><b>The Grand Acquisitions Race</b></p><p>The Grand Acquisitions Race (sometimes also referred to as "the Chevin event") was SWTOR\'s second one-time world event, and a lot less exciting than the original Rakghoul incursion on Tatooine. One reason for this was that <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/world-event-take-2.html">we actually knew that it was coming</a>, even if we didn\'t know the details. The second reason however was that it was simply <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-grand-acquisitions-race-in-review.html">a lot less exciting in terms of activities</a>, as all there was to do was a time-gated puzzle quest chain and farming currency crates on Nar Shaddaa. I have to chuckle a bit when I occasionally see people say that this event should be brought back. People didn\'t even care about it that much when the game was still in its heyday and a limited-time world event was something exciting! Still, I guess my point is you had to be there to know just how underwhelming it really was.</p><p><b>The return of Revan</b></p><p>I think this one might be a bit hard to parse for anyone who started playing after 2014. We all&nbsp;know Revan is in the game, right? There\'s a whole expansion called "Shadow of Revan", no? Well, for a moment, try to imagine that there wasn\'t. Revan is in the game, but only in this weird side quest that you\'ll only see if you like doing group content, and he\'s a prisoner one moment and a genocidal maniac the next, and if you blink you\'ll miss him dying as well. Also note that you had to have levelled through and done group content <i>on both factions</i> to be able to make sense of this brief cameo, something which fans of the original KotOR were not at all happy about.</p><p>Then it\'s 2014 - we\'ve been level 55 for a bit over a year, got several new daily areas and raids, everything\'s kind of chugging along nicely if you\'re not dying for your character\'s personal story to be continued... and then we start getting <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/04/assault-on-tython-and-korriban.html">a new series of flashpoints</a> that\'s being promoted as a new story arc called "Forged Alliances". That Theron guy is kinda cute, but aside from that it\'s all a bit mysterious. Who are these new troublemakers in the shadows? The answer came <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/09/legacy-of-rakata.html">in September</a>, in a post in which I felt the need to give a spoiler warning.</p><p>Whoa, Revan is back? Revan is <i>alive</i>? Is it really him though? And then <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/10/quick-30-announcement-thoughts.html">a whole expansion with his name</a>! It was exciting times for a while, showing once again that Revan\'s name still attracted the crowds. I think reception of the expansion storyline was ultimately a bit mixed - it gave the character a better send-off than the base game had for sure, but it was still a bit awkward in the eyes of some.</p><p><b>The launch of Knights of the Fallen Empire</b></p><p>Did you realise that we\'re less than a month away from the KotFE expansion turning ten years old? I\'m sure I\'m not the only long-time player who still thinks of everything pre-KotFE as the good old days, and everything that came after it as "the new stuff". It is after all a fact that it changed the game in bigger ways than perhaps anything that came afterwards, with the introduction of features like level sync or its complete overhaul of the companion system.</p><p>Still, I\'m not even talking about all of that. What made KotFE\'s launch a "you had to be there" moment was just <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/06/fallen-empire-stuff.html">how absolutely insane the hype was</a>. A new CGI trailer for the first time since launch! Accidental leaks with announcements that could be interpreted in multiple possible ways! General Star Wars hype as <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-star-wars-hype-is-building-up.html">we were all looking forward to the sequel trilogy</a>! (Oops.) Absolute mayhem!</p><p>And when it came out, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/10/knights-of-fallen-empires-story-is.html">people (including me) did indeed love it</a>! Mainstream gaming sites were like "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/knights-of-the-fallen-empire-a-great-solo-star-wars-story/" target="_blank">hey, this game still exists and is good</a>"! It felt like we were all set for a big SWTOR renaissance... except it all fizzled out within a couple of months. People thought the story was neat, but they didn\'t want to hang around to wait for one new chapter per month. They felt there wasn\'t enough to do at endgame. And those of us who <i>did</i> stick around quickly found out how tedious the new story was to play through on alts, never mind the plot going in directions that became more and more aggravating. For the second time in its life, SWTOR had released (something) with a lot of hype and then failed to live up to it.</p><p><b>Galactic Command</b></p><p>For anyone who might not know, Galactic Command was a new gearing/endgame progression system introduced&nbsp;with the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion, and in its original iteration, it was the worst system of its kind that I\'ve personally ever seen. To add insult to injury, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/10/galactic-command-bioware-trying-to.html">people (including me) were telling them from the moment it was announced that it was a bad idea</a>, but the devs were all "nah, it\'ll work and be fun, you\'ll see".</p><p>It didn\'t and it wasn\'t. For me, the early days of Galactic Command <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/12/control-alt-escape.html">were one of my all-time low points with the game</a>. Fortunately the devs scrambled to fix it immediately after launch, but it took about six months to get it into what could be described as an "acceptable" state and many players <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/11/galactic-command-is-alright-now.html">held a grudge long after</a>. It\'s another one of those things that in hindsight makes you wonder what could\'ve been <i>sooo</i> bad about it, but if you were there, you know.</p><p><b>Theron\'s betrayal</b></p><p>I did say there were spoilers in here,&nbsp;didn\'t I?&nbsp;I think looking at the game\'s storylines as a whole, the Fractured Alliances story (consisting of the three flashpoints Crisis on Umbara, Traitor Among the Chiss and The Nathema Conspiracy) is probably not among many people\'s favourites. The writing definitely felt like it had dug itself into a bit of a hole with Knights of the Eternal Throne, and it wasn\'t clear how it was going to get out of it.</p><p>I actually think that Fractured Alliances ultimately succeeded in what it set out to do, but it\'s fair to say that it was a bumpy ride. One thing I really did enjoy about it though was the community interactions it created. Theron\'s betrayal in Crisis on Umbara was not well-received for a <i>variety</i> of reasons, but it was interesting to watch the conversation around it evolve as more people started to believe that the whole thing was just a ruse. In hindsight, there are some hints towards this from the beginning, but they were easy to overlook at first.</p><p>People just didn\'t want their love interest to betray them, and there was even a hashtag called #believeintheron making the rounds on Twitter. I remember seeing screenshots of people assembling on Odessen with all their Therons out and forming a heart-shape or something. I just thought that was very cool, and actually kind of made me more invested in the final outcome than the story itself would have been able to do on its own.</p><p><b>Darth Malgus\' return</b></p><p>Back in 2017, I wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/10/11-npcs-that-died-before-their-time.html">11 NPCs That Died Before Their Time</a>" and Darth Malgus was second on my list. I just couldn\'t believe that they put him in all the cinematic trailers and then simply had him get killed off in one of the first endgame flashpoints! I\'m not sure I was aware at the time that there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajDDJDY0Y-k" target="_blank">a supposedly deleted scene from the KotFE trailer</a> that showed Malgus being delivered to Valkorion, frozen in a block of carbonite. Even if I was, it seemed obvious at the time that they\'d deleted it for a reason and for all intents and purposes, Malgus was still considered dead.</p><p>When he really did come back with the Ossus update at the end of 2018, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-return-of-spoiler.html">I absolutely loved it</a>. It was a really well-presented surprise, and while I don\'t think it was as big as the return of Revan, for me personally it was actually <i>more</i> meaningful than that had been. It\'s hard to think that it\'s already been seven years since then - at this point it feels like it should be obvious to everyone playing the game in any capacity at all that Darth Malgus is alive. However, that moment when we first found out was definitely special. (Cue some comment about how he\'s unfortunately outstayed his welcome since then.)</p><p><b>Move to Broadsword</b></p><p>Two years ago, when <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/swtor-to-move-from-bioware-to-broadsword.html">IGN leaked the news that Star Wars: The Old Republic was going to be transferred from Bioware to some largely unknown studio called Broadsword Entertainment</a>, all hell broke loose in the community for a few weeks.&nbsp;I think dedicated SWTOR players are quite used to endless doom-saying about the game and are well-practised at ignoring it by this point, but this sounded serious, and it was not at all clear what the consequences were going to be.</p><p>To me it was probably more worrying than even the original free-to-play announcement had been, and I found myself seeking solace in spending a lot more time than usual talking to fellow content creators. I also felt compelled to try and do my own part by practising something vaguely resembling journalism, which meant assembling information from different sources and trying to put it into context for people. In hindsight it seems almost silly how much we worried, considering how little changed from a player perspective after the studio transition, but at the time it was big news.</p><p><b>Runner-ups:</b></p><p>I could\'ve tried to come up with even more stories, but I thought that 10 was a good number to stop at. Nonetheless, here are three more events that I considered mentioning but decided against because they were mostly negative but also ultimately not <i>that</i> interesting to talk about in detail in my opinion:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The original free-to-play transition</li><li>The Legacy of the Sith expansion launch</li><li>The whole <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/character-modernisation-panic-on-pts.html">character texture update</a> drama</li></ul><p>Which of all of these events were you personally around for? Do you agree with my characterisation of how things went down? Are there any other major events in the game\'s history that you would\'ve included on this list?</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>Star Wars: The Old Republic is primarily know for its developer-crafted stories, but any player who\'s engaged with the social side of the game for any length of time knows that there are also community-driven stories and dramas, and moments when you simply had to be there to know what made them so exciting, even if some of the related content is still available in the game today. As someone who\'s been a subscriber since early access and never stopped playing, I thought it would be fun to share some of the most interesting moments I remember with my readers, especially with newer ones who may not have been playing as long.</p><p>Note: If you\'ve never played through some of the expansion storylines, some of the later items on this list will contain story spoilers.</p><p><b>The /getdown bug</b></p><p>Going chronologically, let\'s start with a story with which I amused my guildies one night. Back when the game launched, you could apparently do dance emotes in combat, and someone quickly discovered that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/o1luk/huge_exploit_typing_getdown_will_interrupt_an/" target="_blank">doing /getdown would suddenly prevent opponents from attacking</a>. This was actually picked up by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/let-the-wookiee-waltz-swtors-god-cheat" target="_blank">several gaming</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dancing-exploit-uncovered-in-the-old-republic" target="_blank">news sites</a> at the time, both because SWTOR was the newest hotness in town and because the mere idea of enemies being stunned into inaction by your dancing skills was a very funny thing to write headlines about.</p><p>I never saw this bug in action myself, but I did come across this comic on social media at the time which made me laugh so much that I saved it:</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcsNcSxsfLhqSOCaVxJ1NWyLqP7L1d0CpzEKRIBtfDaSk-qki1XmEbXD298DqygHNtvzeinCG5LPio-Lfhykc8VHK5o4NA8R5o4FR3PeNiivndjqvOTvp8p7wP_RwslOKqfAELchTtXMzIVcPGmzMqh4rSicws7DVUaamRntcOPi3KRkceF2sv2MZ3H7A/s2795/Getdown%20battle.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A cartoon shows a large battle droid saying &quot;Prepare to be crushed, foolish Jedi&quot; while facing two Jedi knights.

I wish I could credit the original artist (Minicrit?) with a link, but alas, RIP Google Plus. </i><br /></p><p><b>The big PvP debacle on original Ilum</b></p><p>Another thing that made headlines around launch was the planet Ilum and the PvP taking place there. You see, the western ice shelf where the Gree visit nowadays used to be a dedicated PvP area. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JNT33oSXjE" target="_blank">This brief video by Force Gaming</a> should give you an idea of how it was <i>supposed</i> to work. It was released about two weeks after launch, and the video notes that at the time, people were just flipping objectives and not much PvP was going on. This was "fixed" with a patch... that in turn <a href="https://spinksville.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/swtor-the-oops-we-just-broke-high-level-world-pvp-patch/" target="_blank">broke the area in a whole bunch of other ways</a>. The result were crazy AoE fests that the game\'s engine couldn\'t deal with very well, which caused people to gain valour way too fast, even as they were just dying over and over in the mayhem. It was just chaos and caused endless complaints.</p><p>Once again, this is something I didn\'t actually get to experience directly, as I took my time levelling and didn\'t get to Ilum until about three months later, by which time all the craziness had already died down. In January 2013, I actually wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-strangeness-of-ilum-year-later.html">The strangeness of Ilum a year later</a>", but in those first weeks after launch, it was seemingly all people would talk about on forums and news sites, about how this newly launched MMO clearly didn\'t know how to deal with PvP and was therefore already failing horribly.</p><p><b>The original Rakghoul event</b></p><p>The recurring Rakghoul Resurgence event is probably old hat to most of you at this point - just another world event that comes around every so often and which has been around for what feels like forever. The very first Rakghoul event in April 2012 though... that was something else. The activities it came with weren\'t really any more exciting than what we have in the repeating event, but the vibe was very different and unique, mainly because we had no idea it was coming.</p><p>The game was still very new at the time, had a lot going on and we were getting patches and updates about more patches all the time... but this came as a complete surprise, and the experience of everyone being confused about what was going on and slowly figuring things out over the course of the first day was unique and exciting in a way that I think is hard to convey nowadays.

The Jedi Prisoner is an interesting storyline, but all the flashpoints involved in it are definitely in the bottom half of my list if I had to rank all flashpoints from best to worst. Gameplay-wise, they\'re all kind of long and boring, and while there are a lot of mobs that can be skipped, that just makes the whole experience feel a bit unsatisfying in a different way (to me anyway). Also, what\'s the point of doing Boarding Party if you don\'t get to confront Captain Yelto at the end?!</p><p>Unsurprisingly, my favourite run of this objective was the one I did with Mr Commando, who - despite not having run any flashpoints in what felt like forever - still remembered his exact pulling routine to unlock the Taral V bonus boss in what he felt was the most efficient way possible, which I thought was quite beautiful to behold. As it happened, we also had to pug one dps in that run, and I was a bit worried that we might get someone who\'d be annoyed at us not skipping everything to finish the run as quickly as possible. However, we got lucky and got a level 15 who actually seemed quite delighted by the experience, gained six levels throughout the flashpoint and asked us at the end whether we wanted to do another one, which I thought was cute.</p><p>Running a master mode flashpoint was also an objective once again, and I was happy to do so on five servers (Shae Vizla is only being left out because I can\'t get the queue to pop there, even while queueing as tank or healer). My random pops this week were Blood Hunt, Cademimu, Mandalorian Raiders and Assault on Tython times two, which took me up to four runs of the latter this season already.</p><p>I\'m curious whether that was just pure RNG or whether this is a side effect of the new exclusion rules. I have this theory that people primarily choose to exclude flashpoints from their random queue for three reasons:</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>They\'re perceived as too hard (e.g. Ruins of Nul, Shrine of Silence).</li><li>They\'re perceived as too long (e.g. The Esseles, Directive 7).</li><li>They\'re perceived as easy and overfarmed to an annoying degree (e.g. Hammer Station, Athiss).</li></ol><p>If all four people that are up next in the queue have excluded five flashpoints for different reasons, that narrows the selection down by quite a lot - and I reckon Assault on Tython may simply be one of those that slips through the net either way, as it\'s neither faceroll easy nor particularly hard, and not terribly long either (especially if you skip some of the early trash). Has anyone else been seeing more of this one than usual? My hypothesis will need further testing for sure.</p><p>As for the other flashpoints, Blood Hunt was largely unremarkable, and Cademimu was the one I did with Mr Commando, which once again meant doing the bonus and just dragging a pug along whether they liked it or not, though they didn\'t complain about it. It was funny though when the guildie who was our fourth accidentally took the elevator downstairs in the middle of the bonus boss fight.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the weirdest/most amusing run was probably the Mandalorian Raiders I did on Satele Shan. I noted <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/gs9-flashpointing-week-3.html">last week</a> that I\'m not a fan of dps running ahead and pulling when I\'m the tank, right? Well, in this one there was a Guardian dps who took off like a bat out of hell the moment we zoned in and then kept pulling non-stop. I considered saying something like "you know this is master mode, right" but decided that this would\'ve been too passive-aggressive - but also, I was honestly kind of confused more than anything because of how he kept <i>getting away</i> with it, in the sense that none of the trash seemed to hurt him too badly even when he got all the aggro. I was even starting to wonder whether I\'d accidentally queued for veteran mode by mistake.</p><p>It wasn\'t until we killed Braxx the Bloodhound with the healer dead and everyone else on about ten percent health that the Guardian paused and said something along the lines of "I only just realised this is master mode since there were no kolto stations". So that was kind of humorous. He did stop pulling after that, we had a few more mishaps anyway, but ultimately it was all good.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>This week was probably the least fun week of Galactic Season 9 for me so far, though I can\'t tell for sure whether the objectives were just less fun by themselves or whether my "new season enthusiasm" was slowly starting to wear off.

The cherry on top was that this particular encounter has an achievement for clicking the terminal really quickly after getting to that stage of progression - not this week, bucko!</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxNr5_CGl83zXhHIAJ4-_d6qzrSlu39SIrrZR3xzeG-46ckmcM8sRBHn4ieCRNx9aWWv8jYeB3uyjcbKsyf37p7CH93SDUIlpRKbz7_ESfeVSbGXz3H65yWW54EPkfI4JdS2ioKMnsRElUlOXNG_3ja4YOszZ59XkMrnLfI1Kqb5oxdZOqEIa0rkDkFHI/s1920/Crowd%20in%20Kaas%20City%20dynamic%20encounter.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A crowd of people in the Kaas City expansion area, waiting for a dynamic encounter terminal to respawn" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxNr5_CGl83zXhHIAJ4-_d6qzrSlu39SIrrZR3xzeG-46ckmcM8sRBHn4ieCRNx9aWWv8jYeB3uyjcbKsyf37p7CH93SDUIlpRKbz7_ESfeVSbGXz3H65yWW54EPkfI4JdS2ioKMnsRElUlOXNG_3ja4YOszZ59XkMrnLfI1Kqb5oxdZOqEIa0rkDkFHI/w400-h225/Crowd%20in%20Kaas%20City%20dynamic%20encounter.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The veteran flashpoint of the week was the first part of the Jedi Prisoner storyline on each faction, which meant running either Taral V or Boarding Party and was another objective I wasn\'t too thrilled about. The Jedi Prisoner is an interesting storyline, but all the flashpoints involved in it are definitely in the bottom half of my list if I had to rank all flashpoints from best to worst. Gameplay-wise, they\'re all kind of long and boring, and while there are a lot of mobs that can be skipped, that just makes the whole experience feel a bit unsatisfying in a different way (to me anyway). Also, what\'s the point of doing Boarding Party if you don\'t get to confront Captain Yelto at the end?!</p><p>Unsurprisingly, my favourite run of this objective was the one I did with Mr Commando, who - despite not having run any flashpoints in what felt like forever - still remembered his exact pulling routine to unlock the Taral V bonus boss in what he felt was the most efficient way possible, which I thought was quite beautiful to behold. As it happened, we also had to pug one dps in that run, and I was a bit worried that we might get someone who\'d be annoyed at us not skipping everything to finish the run as quickly as possible. However, we got lucky and got a level 15 who actually seemed quite delighted by the experience, gained six levels throughout the flashpoint and asked us at the end whether we wanted to do another one, which I thought was cute.</p><p>Running a master mode flashpoint was also an objective once again, and I was happy to do so on five servers (Shae Vizla is only being left out because I can\'t get the queue to pop there, even while queueing as tank or healer). My random pops this week were Blood Hunt, Cademimu, Mandalorian Raiders and Assault on Tython times two, which took me up to four runs of the latter this season already.</p><p>I\'m curious whether that was just pure RNG or whether this is a side effect of the new exclusion rules. I have this theory that people primarily choose to exclude flashpoints from their random queue for three reasons:</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>They\'re perceived as too hard (e.g. Ruins of Nul, Shrine of Silence).</li><li>They\'re perceived as too long (e.g. The Esseles, Directive 7).</li><li>They\'re perceived as easy and overfarmed to an annoying degree (e.g. Hammer Station, Athiss).</li></ol><p>If all four people that are up next in the queue have excluded five flashpoints for different reasons, that narrows the selection down by quite a lot - and I reckon Assault on Tython may simply be one of those that slips through the net either way, as it\'s neither faceroll easy nor particularly hard, and not terribly long either (especially if you skip some of the early trash). Has anyone else been seeing more of this one than usual? My hypothesis will need further testing for sure.</p><p>As for the other flashpoints, Blood Hunt was largely unremarkable, and Cademimu was the one I did with Mr Commando, which once again meant doing the bonus and just dragging a pug along whether they liked it or not, though they didn\'t complain about it. It was funny though when the guildie who was our fourth accidentally took the elevator downstairs in the middle of the bonus boss fight.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the weirdest/most amusing run was probably the Mandalorian Raiders I did on Satele Shan. I noted <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/gs9-flashpointing-week-3.html">last week</a> that I\'m not a fan of dps running ahead and pulling when I\'m the tank, right? Well, in this one there was a Guardian dps who took off like a bat out of hell the moment we zoned in and then kept pulling non-stop. I considered saying something like "you know this is master mode, right" but decided that this would\'ve been too passive-aggressive - but also, I was honestly kind of confused more than anything because of how he kept <i>getting away</i> with it, in the sense that none of the trash seemed to hurt him too badly even when he got all the aggro. I was even starting to wonder whether I\'d accidentally queued for veteran mode by mistake.</p><p>It wasn\'t until we killed Braxx the Bloodhound with the healer dead and everyone else on about ten percent health that the Guardian paused and said something along the lines of "I only just realised this is master mode since there were no kolto stations". So that was kind of humorous. He did stop pulling after that, we had a few more mishaps anyway, but ultimately it was all good.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/gs9-week-4-thoughts.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/gs9-week-4-thoughts.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxNr5_CGl83zXhHIAJ4-_d6qzrSlu39SIrrZR3xzeG-46ckmcM8sRBHn4ieCRNx9aWWv8jYeB3uyjcbKsyf37p7CH93SDUIlpRKbz7_ESfeVSbGXz3H65yWW54EPkfI4JdS2ioKMnsRElUlOXNG_3ja4YOszZ59XkMrnLfI1Kqb5oxdZOqEIa0rkDkFHI/s72-w400-h225-c/Crowd%20in%20Kaas%20City%20dynamic%20encounter.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '2'}

You know it\'s an easy one when you set yourself a goal to reach a certain objective by the end of the week and end up ticking off several others by accident before you even get there! That\'s the kind of week it was.</p><p>The dynamic encounter planet of the week was Ilum. It\'s the planet I\'ve <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/ranking-77-dynamic-encounter-planets.html">ranked as the least fun</a> in terms of dynamic encounters so far, but the reason I did so was that I think many encounters have a high mob density that tends to get in the way of whatever the actual objective is. In a week like this one, where there were plenty of people on Ilum every day, this wasn\'t nearly as bad as mobs were constantly getting cleared out left and right. Turns out even the rather tedious Fall of Fort Tonvarr can be fun with a sufficiently large crowd of people around.</p><p>The featured veteran mode flashpoint of the week was Mandalorian Raiders, which is another relatively easy one. I wonder if all the featured flashpoints will be softballs or whether the devs will make us "graduate" to some of the trickier ones as the season progresses.</p><p>Anyway, nothing too noteworthy happened in any of my runs of this particular flashpoint this week, except that in one run where we had particularly high dps (it was a group with multiple level 80s if I recall correctly) the last boss was burned down so quickly that he completely forgot to do any mechanics, just stood there and didn\'t move until he died. The only downside of this was that this also seemed to bug out his on-screen position, as none of us were able to loot him, always getting the "you can\'t reach that" error message.</p><p>I still remember when at least parts of this flashpoint could be quite deadly, such as if you pushed the last boss himself too quickly and got too many turret adds, but in the one group where this happened it was no problem to survive the turret fire anyway.</p><p>Also, the dog trash used to hit so hard, I remember on master mode we\'d have to rotate stuns to make sure the tank would survive. I will say though that in runs with lower-level characters, I did notice that ahead of some pulls with multiple dogs, people often suddenly step on the brakes, clearly waiting for someone else to go first and get pounced on (I tended to volunteer).</p><p>The more exciting thing were once again the master mode flashpoints though, even if I got a pretty tame selection this week.</p><p>On Leviathan I got Hammer Station at last! I\'m happy that it took until week three for it to show up in my randoms. Also, we actually killed all the trash to the first boss properly instead of trying to run like headless chickens, which is something I appreciated.</p><p>On Tulak Hord I got into a Maelstrom Prison and nearly died on the first pull when I got all the healer aggro just as a guildie was asking me something, but other than that it was smooth. And yes, a guildie was actually online in the largely inactive guild I joined! They asked me to invite an alt of theirs into the guild, so I had them invite two of mine in return after the flashpoint, so I can at last reap a few more Conquest rewards on this server. (Now, if only I knew what to do with my Imps...)</p><p>On Star Forge, I did several flashpoints on Swtorista\'s stream, and we got Nathema Conspiracy and Legacy of the Rakata. In the former, we actually did no skips, and we all agreed that the last boss used to be way harder somehow. In the latter, we wiped once on the bonus boss, oops! But it was all good fun.</p><p>On Satele Shan, I once again used my magic tank powers to get an instant pop for a pug. The power is addictive! This time I got into Red Reaper, a flashpoint I hadn\'t done in ages. A dps Powertech was constantly running ahead, which annoyed me a bit because if you\'re on a class that can tank and you want to always be the first to charge in, just queue as tank, damn it! These sorts of damage dealers are my least favourite to tank for. Though this one did stop just short of actually trying to pull for me. Fortunately I did still end up remembering all the pulls and skips so I managed to keep up reasonably well.

You know it\'s an easy one when you set yourself a goal to reach a certain objective by the end of the week and end up ticking off several others by accident before you even get there! That\'s the kind of week it was.</p><p>The dynamic encounter planet of the week was Ilum. It\'s the planet I\'ve <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/ranking-77-dynamic-encounter-planets.html">ranked as the least fun</a> in terms of dynamic encounters so far, but the reason I did so was that I think many encounters have a high mob density that tends to get in the way of whatever the actual objective is. In a week like this one, where there were plenty of people on Ilum every day, this wasn\'t nearly as bad as mobs were constantly getting cleared out left and right. Turns out even the rather tedious Fall of Fort Tonvarr can be fun with a sufficiently large crowd of people around.</p><p>The featured veteran mode flashpoint of the week was Mandalorian Raiders, which is another relatively easy one. I wonder if all the featured flashpoints will be softballs or whether the devs will make us "graduate" to some of the trickier ones as the season progresses.</p><p>Anyway, nothing too noteworthy happened in any of my runs of this particular flashpoint this week, except that in one run where we had particularly high dps (it was a group with multiple level 80s if I recall correctly) the last boss was burned down so quickly that he completely forgot to do any mechanics, just stood there and didn\'t move until he died. The only downside of this was that this also seemed to bug out his on-screen position, as none of us were able to loot him, always getting the "you can\'t reach that" error message.</p><p>I still remember when at least parts of this flashpoint could be quite deadly, such as if you pushed the last boss himself too quickly and got too many turret adds, but in the one group where this happened it was no problem to survive the turret fire anyway.</p><p>Also, the dog trash used to hit so hard, I remember on master mode we\'d have to rotate stuns to make sure the tank would survive. I will say though that in runs with lower-level characters, I did notice that ahead of some pulls with multiple dogs, people often suddenly step on the brakes, clearly waiting for someone else to go first and get pounced on (I tended to volunteer).</p><p>The more exciting thing were once again the master mode flashpoints though, even if I got a pretty tame selection this week.</p><p>On Leviathan I got Hammer Station at last! I\'m happy that it took until week three for it to show up in my randoms. Also, we actually killed all the trash to the first boss properly instead of trying to run like headless chickens, which is something I appreciated.</p><p>On Tulak Hord I got into a Maelstrom Prison and nearly died on the first pull when I got all the healer aggro just as a guildie was asking me something, but other than that it was smooth. And yes, a guildie was actually online in the largely inactive guild I joined! They asked me to invite an alt of theirs into the guild, so I had them invite two of mine in return after the flashpoint, so I can at last reap a few more Conquest rewards on this server. (Now, if only I knew what to do with my Imps...)</p><p>On Star Forge, I did several flashpoints on Swtorista\'s stream, and we got Nathema Conspiracy and Legacy of the Rakata. In the former, we actually did no skips, and we all agreed that the last boss used to be way harder somehow. In the latter, we wiped once on the bonus boss, oops! But it was all good fun.</p><p>On Satele Shan, I once again used my magic tank powers to get an instant pop for a pug. The power is addictive! This time I got into Red Reaper, a flashpoint I hadn\'t done in ages. A dps Powertech was constantly running ahead, which annoyed me a bit because if you\'re on a class that can tank and you want to always be the first to charge in, just queue as tank, damn it! These sorts of damage dealers are my least favourite to tank for. Though this one did stop just short of actually trying to pull for me. Fortunately I did still end up remembering all the pulls and skips so I managed to keep up reasonably well. I was really just having tank ego problems here: I got an instant pop and had a smooth run where nobody died, but one of the dps was playing in a manner that was slightly annoying to me, woe is me.</p><p>On Darth Malgus, we managed to field two groups for master mode flashpoints after our social ops run on Saturday, which was something I was very happy to see as I\'ve always felt that flashpoints are a great social activity.

Yet the level 80 was constantly mounting up and driving ahead, aggroing absolutely everything to pull it into a corner at the end, while the rest of us slowly jogged after them on foot.

I got the impression that at least one of them got a bit flustered by that and tried to overcompensate by mounting up and rushing ahead even of the level 80 at one point, just to then be told off because not everyone had made it up the elevator yet when we were put into combat as a result of that (which was technically correct but also must\'ve been confusing in terms of mixed messages).</p><p>I got really annoyed with that level 80\'s attitude but didn\'t say anything because frankly I was quite busy just keeping up with their constant running myself, as well as just keeping everyone else alive.

I just kept hoping that neither of the little guys were genuinely new players because if I had been a newbie in that situation, I would have been <i>so</i> put off from running flashpoints ever again.</p><p>Now, to be clear, all of this technically has nothing to do with the cut scene change, because people could act like that while the group conversations were still a thing. However, at least the cut scenes would put the brakes on things a little bit. They were a reminder that this flashpoint wasn\'t <i>designed</i> to be rushed like that. And I feel that the removal of the cut scenes does the opposite now, vindicating people like that level 80 in the sense that yes, the devs agree with you that flashpoints are something to get over and done with as quickly as possible. I feel like my opinion was validated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1mvj1j5/group_finder_flashpoint_skippers_are_insatiable/">a thread on the SWTOR subreddit</a>&nbsp;posted this week about how this kind of behaviour seemed to be worse than ever since the patch. In a comment thread there, someone who commented that "games are meant to be fun" also received the reply: "It\'s a season objective. <b>Literally not meant to be fun.</b> Just a way to progress."</p><p>I just kept thinking to myself: What are we doing here? Why are we optimising content for people who don\'t like it? And I realised that I\'m worried about SWTOR flashpoints going down the way of World of Warcraft dungeons.</p><p>WoW was my first MMO as well as my introduction to doing group content with random players, and I <i>loved</i> it. The first time I did the Deadmines? Amazing. I got yelled at for ninja-looting a chest because I didn\'t know any better, but I apologised, learned from it and we moved on. For about three or four years, dungeons were easily one of my favourite things to do in the game. However, somewhere along the line, things changed. Blizzard wanted players to run dungeons in greater numbers and more often, so they became increasingly incentivised for endless replay, and people\'s attitudes changed accordingly.</p><p>I still play WoW almost twenty years later, but I rarely do dungeons in its modern incarnation now. Every now and then some reward will lure me into queueing up for a pug dungeon again, just for me to instantly be reminded of why I no longer find them fun. Everything is just an insane rush to the end to pick up the reward and it\'s a casual or new player\'s absolute nightmare.</p><p>When I started playing SWTOR, I instantly fell in love with the game\'s flashpoints too. The Esseles and Black Talon are absolutely amazing experiences that have no real equivalent in other games when you play through them in a group for the first time and as intended (which is to say, actually paying attention to the story and listening to the group conversations). They are also clearly not intended to be re-run on a daily basis. Sure, they can be fun to re-play every now and then, to see what different conversation choices do and so on, but it\'s clearly not something you\'re supposed to do <i>all the time</i>. The game won\'t stop you from running it multiple times a day if you want to, but I think it\'s fair to say that you were effectively "doing it wrong" in that case and couldn\'t really complain if it wasn\'t super fun. The idea with SWTOR flashpoints was that they were still meant to be a bit of an adventure every time you entered one, something you can only really consume in moderation.</p><p>With this change... I don\'t really know anymore. I can even defend the removal of cut scenes as a temporary measure for the Galactic Season, mostly because it benefits me personally, but people like me, who do Galactic Seasons on every server, can hardly make up a significant chunk of the player base. Clearly the intent is to get more players into flashpoints that haven\'t done them before, but I\'m not sure this whole exercise is going to show them anything appealing enough to want to come back. Endless running along corridors with no rhyme or reason about what is going on? What\'s appealing about that?</p><p>I also saw someone comment somewhere that Final Fantasy XIV used to have a similar problem with new players having a bad experience in the group finder due to issues with cut scene skipping, and Square Enix\'s solution to that was to make the cut scenes unskippable for <i>everyone</i> and increase the reward payout to make sure veterans were being suitably compensated for the fact that the run was taking longer to accommodate the newbies. Now, I don\'t play FFXIV myself, so I can\'t tell you how well that worked out for everyone, but I think it shows that "whelp, we\'ve got to cater to the people who are in a hurry" is not an inevitability. SWTOR and FF have a lot in common in terms of their focus on story, so it\'s actually kind of odd to me now to see the SWTOR devs choose speed-running over story in this instance.</p><p>At this point, after thinking about it some more, I feel like instead of removing cut scenes all over the place they should\'ve gone back and reconsidered what flashpoints are all about and why people are funnelled into them the way they are. Why do people ask to skip cut scenes? Because they\'re in a flashpoint they don\'t really want to be in. Why are they in this flashpoint? Because we give extra rewards for queueing for a random flashpoint. Why do we give rewards for that? So people who want to run specific flashpoints can get groups for them. But why would people run the Esseles in a group these days when there is a solo mode available anyway? Maybe the devs should\'ve just taken it out of the group finder like they did Kuat and Colicoid War Games. Leaving it in but taking out everything that actually made it unique and insteresting just feels like extremely muddled game design to me.

The image doesn\'t actually show the choice, but I saved it under the name "light side pug" - so the fact that I had ended up in a group of all light side characters on Imperial side stood out to me. I loved it when I found my people! And when someone disagreed about what the "right" choice was in a certain scenario, there was usually some friendly banter to be had. No more.</p><p></p><p>(Just as a disclaimer so nobody gets the wrong idea: I didn\'t "force" any of these pugs to wait for me while I was watching cut scenes. My attitude was always to skip if people wanted to skip, and watch if people wanted to watch, but you could easily get some great shots of certain moments even while space-barring through most of the conversation.)</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p><p>I said in <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/07/some-interesting-news-from-swtors-771.html">my post about the dev live stream last month</a> that the most impactful announcement to me was that patch 7.1.1 was going to remove all cut scenes and group conversations from group finder flashpoints.

The image doesn\'t actually show the choice, but I saved it under the name "light side pug" - so the fact that I had ended up in a group of all light side characters on Imperial side stood out to me. I loved it when I found my people! And when someone disagreed about what the "right" choice was in a certain scenario, there was usually some friendly banter to be had. No more.</p><p></p><p>(Just as a disclaimer so nobody gets the wrong idea: I didn\'t "force" any of these pugs to wait for me while I was watching cut scenes.

It could be very hit and miss whether our tank could kite him long enough without anything going horribly wrong.

The best we could work out eventually was that a Watchman Sentinel\'s group healing could cause the add to mistake them for a healer and leap to them, because the moment our own Sentinel changed to a different spec for this fight, the random leaps into melee stopped happening.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/another-one-for-books-scum-speed-run.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/another-one-for-books-scum-speed-run.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3Uo6I8H2wt3B3tn75sZTwtqDUowehc6ljxTdMbLrjZQgwL1cd6FBSIVT641LMgyOdVM2_NT48vXcebI5tgZKUpEwUtMjv74lmibd7bzFHefXCK3_bkRuOprZtlS1thAR6wGlxIh1Eva1c0EwbCLx2aCpBGgA0btyjbTbrCOa3tJbrN0dhwZXnr3QlBew/s72-w400-h225-c/Scum%20speed%20run%20achievement%20shot.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

I had fun with the top ten lists I made for <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/01/the-best-and-worst-dynamic-encounters.html">Hoth</a> and <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/01/the-best-and-worst-dynamic-encounters.html">Tatooine</a>, but that format doesn\'t work so well when you\'re dealing with a larger number of planets, each of which has a much smaller number of dynamic encounters than <i>those</i> two.</p><p>I ultimately decided that I\'m just going to rank the planets against each other instead, talking about each planet in more general terms instead of discussing too many individual encounters in detail.</p><p>Going from best to worst, I would start with:&nbsp;</p><p><b>1. Dromund Kaas</b></p><p>If you split the seven planets that had dynamic encounters added in 7.7 into three groups - capital worlds, starter planets and Ilum - I think both of the capital worlds definitely came out on top. With more than twenty unique encounters per planet they offer the most variety of the bunch, as well as offering an easy way to grind Conquest points.</p><p>The encounters on Dromund Kaas are thematically very varied, mostly leaning into the different regional "themes" previously established in side missions, such as the spaceport being somewhat in disarray or the lightning spires being under attack. They mostly seem to be set in the same time period as those original exploration missions, though I noticed while dispersing unruly Imperial citizens in Kaas City that one of them yelled "What is Xarion hiding?", which I thought was an interesting detail that would place that one after Onslaught in the timeline.</p><p>In general, most of the encounters are quick and fun, and strategically placed in locations where people are bound to come through on their way to some other mission objective, making it very temping to allow yourself to be distracted for a moment to complete an encounter. Prime examples of this are doing "Bad Monkey" just after arriving at the spaceport, or hunting down the rogue bounty hunter while passing through Kaas City.</p><p>If I had to cite anything negative, I\'d say that there are a <i>couple</i> of encounters with flaws. The Apex Predator in "Shock and Awe" feels way overtuned for levelling players (trying to solo it on a level thirty-something with a healer companion I was chunked to death within only a couple of hits), and the final boss for "Kubaz Incursion" can be a bit annoyingly hard to find. "Powder Keg" actually being possible to fail is a neat idea but the fact that it\'s the only encounter of this kind and that it\'s not obvious at all what is going on unless you\'re already in the know makes it a bit unpleasant in that regard.</p><p>Also, I wish they\'d fix encounter voice lines sometimes playing when the encounter isn\'t even up, because every time my speeder rides past the lightning spires I get spammed with yells about multiple encounters that may not actually all be active.</p><p>Anyway, all in all it\'s still a fun romp, and the reason it\'s edging out Coruscant for first place in my opinion is that the map makes it both cheap and easy to get around if you want to do multiple encounters. Which brings us to...</p><p><b>2. Coruscant&nbsp;</b></p><p>In general, Coruscant is one of <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/03/all-swtor-planets-ranked-from-best-to.html">my top three planets in the entire game</a>, and most positive things I said about the dynamic encounters on Dromund Kaas above also apply to Coruscant. The reason I put it in second place is simply the fact that it\'s a bit of a pain to travel between dynamic encounters due to the planetary layout with the different sectors, which all count as being really far apart, which in turn means that moving between them always requires either a looong taxi ride or paying the maximum price for quick travel. Even if you do opt for quick travel though, the sectors are still laid out in such a way that it can be a pain to just travel from one dynamic encounter within the same sector to the next one.</p><p>The said, I adore most of the encounters in the Senate Plaza, which is where I\'m always passing through when I exit my stronghold, and I basically never pass on an opportunity to set off some fireworks or to help clean up the party\'s aftermath.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/s1920/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Fireworks going off at the Senate Plaza on Coruscant" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/w400-h225/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Negatives are that some of the Black Sun and Justicar encounters don\'t have nearly enough clickies if there\'s even more than one person trying to do the encounter at the same time, the way Ugnaught Engineering was horrifically bugged when it first came out and made people get into fights about who was supposedly <i>causing</i> it to bug, stealing kills or whatever (regardless of whether it was true or not), and the one encounter on the Senate Plaza that I don\'t like, "Understaffed". Like with "Powder Keg", you can tell someone just wanted to try something different there, but the final result is just too undercooked, with a tutorial mode that teaches you to do things <i>the wrong way</i>, and people being able to ruin the encounter for each other - both intentionally and unintentionally -&nbsp;which is never a good thing.</p><p><b>3. Tython&nbsp;</b></p><p>Next we have the starter planets, which I think are all pretty similar in quality, and I don\'t feel particularly strongly about the order in which I\'ve ranked them against each other. The main reason I consider them worse than the capital planets it that there are very few encounters, so you\'ll run out of things to do pretty quickly if you\'re just trying to grind on a single planet, and that none of the DEs on the starter planets give Conquest points. I can see why the devs decided to have that limitation, but it still means that for someone who\'s very Conquest-focused like me, they tend to have a lot less replay value.</p><p>With that general preamble out of the way, Tython is definitely my favourite of the bunch, since it\'s my favourite of all the starter planets and I think all its dynamic encounters are very on point, whether you\'re doing simple chores at the Jedi Temple or beating back the flesh raiders.</p><p>The only thing I\'ll say is that I do wonder a little how having a dynamic encounter pop up the moment you leave your intro phase is going to affect new players\' perception of the planet and the game as a whole, and whether it might make things come off as a bit "loud" and overwhelming to less experienced gamers. I would love to have insight into the devs\' behavioural metrics on the starter planets for that one...&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>4. Hutta</b></p><p>Hutta is actually one of my least favourite planets, generally speaking, but I think in terms of dynamic encounters it works well enough. Again, the themes of the encounters go very well with what\'s also conveyed via the existing side missions, from dangerous wildlife to rebellious evocii.</p><p>The only thing I\'m not so sure about is having an encounter that is basically a vehicle quest right outside the spawn phase, because it makes me wonder whether that isn\'t a bit confusing/overwhelming for new players. Even if seeing a bunch of droids enter the gang wars right outside the Poison Pit <i>does</i> serve to drive home the point that the town is a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/s1920/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A walker on Ord Mantell surrounded by dozens of loot beams" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/w400-h225/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>5. Ord Mantell</b><p></p><p>Ord Mantell is one of two planets where I actually feel like some of the encounters are <i>slightly</i> off in tone. This may very well be my personal bias speaking, as someone who mains a trooper and was instantly scarred by being blamed for the death of Bellis the informant at the hands of the separatists by multiple people, but I always perceived the whole setting with the separatists as very dark and desperate. Even the smuggler story with all its goofiness has a pretty dark turn here with Corso\'s parents being dead because of the separatists and him having that one moment where he wants to execute that random sep in cold blood.</p><p>With that said, I just feel like some of the encounters involving separatists feel a bit too silly. Like that mad scientist type sending you out to shoot separatists with one of his droids? It\'s one thing if there\'s a specific NPC that\'s bit ridiculous when you talk to them, that\'s clearly just that one character, but the fact that you hear the dynamic encounter yells repeated endlessly even when you\'re just driving by gives them a much stronger impact on the mood in my opinion. Might just be me.</p><p><b>6. Korriban</b></p><p>That\'s also the reason why I rate Korriban last of this batch, because again, several of the encounters just feel a <i>bit</i> too goofy to me personally. Don\'t get me wrong, both the Sith warrior and inquisitor stories have plenty of humorous moments even on Korriban, but I still always got the vibe that as a <i>setting</i>, the planet is clearly meant to be very grim, with all the racial purity nonsense and dog-eat-dog behaviour encouraged in the acolytes. Stuff like k\'lor\'slugs running wild around the academy feels more like the kind of hijinx you\'d find in a young adult book series about a magic school. (That said, looking at how busy each planet is, this one actually seems to be very popular with people, so again, this might just be me.)</p><p><b>7. Ilum&nbsp;</b></p><p>Finally, in last place - alas, poor Ilum. I really wanted the addition of dynamic encounters to this planet to feel like a revival for it. I have some fond memories of Ilum from the game\'s early days, even though it felt somewhat unfinished even then, but over time it\'s only ever declined in relevance. Sadly I can\'t say that I feel like dynamic encounters have put it back on people\'s radar, and based on the small number of other people I see doing encounters there, I get the impression that it didn\'t really land for the majority of the population either.</p><p>Good things first: the theming is once again spot-on on this one. They really leaned into the Republic vs. Empire conflict from the original storyline and even added some encounter achievements that are meant to encourage world PvP. (I\'m 99% sure that almost nobody will bother with those, but I appreciate the effort.) On the Western Ice Shelf, they\'ve expanded on the lore of the Tonvarr Pirates that were previously only really relevant during the Gree event. It all works.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/s1920/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Sith Pureblood, surrounded by pets and companions, sits on the stone throne inside Fort Tonvarr" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/w400-h225/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The problem is simply that too many of the encounters are just not very fun. Too many of them have multiple stages and feature a large number of mobs - when sometimes mob-killing isn\'t even part of the main objective, which makes it feel like you\'re just endlessly wading back and forth through constantly respawning mobs to actually get to the next clicky you need. It just feels tedious to the point that my brain keeps trying to forget that Ilum is another planet that has dynamic encounters now and I very rarely even remember to go there.</p><p>All that said, I wanted to also give a shout-out to a change to dynamic encounters in general that came with 7.7 but that I didn\'t see in the patch notes: When they released these new encounters, they changed it so that on staged DEs, you no longer need to complete every single stage by yourself to get credit, but rather you can join in at any time and still get completion. I feel that this has been a great change and has been most noticeable for me during encounters such as the base attacks on Tatooine and Hoth. It used to be that I felt that there was no point in joining in if people were already fighting the stage two walker, as it wouldn\'t give me anything and I\'d just have to restart the encounter from scratch afterwards anyway. Now I\'ll gleefully jump in and help out because I\'ll actually be rewarded for it too, which I think has been a great change.</p><p>How many of the new encounters have you done at this point? And do you agree with my ranking of the planets or not?

I had fun with the top ten lists I made for <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/01/the-best-and-worst-dynamic-encounters.html">Hoth</a> and <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/01/the-best-and-worst-dynamic-encounters.html">Tatooine</a>, but that format doesn\'t work so well when you\'re dealing with a larger number of planets, each of which has a much smaller number of dynamic encounters than <i>those</i> two.</p><p>I ultimately decided that I\'m just going to rank the planets against each other instead, talking about each planet in more general terms instead of discussing too many individual encounters in detail.</p><p>Going from best to worst, I would start with:&nbsp;</p><p><b>1. Dromund Kaas</b></p><p>If you split the seven planets that had dynamic encounters added in 7.7 into three groups - capital worlds, starter planets and Ilum - I think both of the capital worlds definitely came out on top. With more than twenty unique encounters per planet they offer the most variety of the bunch, as well as offering an easy way to grind Conquest points.</p><p>The encounters on Dromund Kaas are thematically very varied, mostly leaning into the different regional "themes" previously established in side missions, such as the spaceport being somewhat in disarray or the lightning spires being under attack. They mostly seem to be set in the same time period as those original exploration missions, though I noticed while dispersing unruly Imperial citizens in Kaas City that one of them yelled "What is Xarion hiding?", which I thought was an interesting detail that would place that one after Onslaught in the timeline.</p><p>In general, most of the encounters are quick and fun, and strategically placed in locations where people are bound to come through on their way to some other mission objective, making it very temping to allow yourself to be distracted for a moment to complete an encounter. Prime examples of this are doing "Bad Monkey" just after arriving at the spaceport, or hunting down the rogue bounty hunter while passing through Kaas City.</p><p>If I had to cite anything negative, I\'d say that there are a <i>couple</i> of encounters with flaws. The Apex Predator in "Shock and Awe" feels way overtuned for levelling players (trying to solo it on a level thirty-something with a healer companion I was chunked to death within only a couple of hits), and the final boss for "Kubaz Incursion" can be a bit annoyingly hard to find. "Powder Keg" actually being possible to fail is a neat idea but the fact that it\'s the only encounter of this kind and that it\'s not obvious at all what is going on unless you\'re already in the know makes it a bit unpleasant in that regard.</p><p>Also, I wish they\'d fix encounter voice lines sometimes playing when the encounter isn\'t even up, because every time my speeder rides past the lightning spires I get spammed with yells about multiple encounters that may not actually all be active.</p><p>Anyway, all in all it\'s still a fun romp, and the reason it\'s edging out Coruscant for first place in my opinion is that the map makes it both cheap and easy to get around if you want to do multiple encounters. Which brings us to...</p><p><b>2. Coruscant&nbsp;</b></p><p>In general, Coruscant is one of <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/03/all-swtor-planets-ranked-from-best-to.html">my top three planets in the entire game</a>, and most positive things I said about the dynamic encounters on Dromund Kaas above also apply to Coruscant. The reason I put it in second place is simply the fact that it\'s a bit of a pain to travel between dynamic encounters due to the planetary layout with the different sectors, which all count as being really far apart, which in turn means that moving between them always requires either a looong taxi ride or paying the maximum price for quick travel. Even if you do opt for quick travel though, the sectors are still laid out in such a way that it can be a pain to just travel from one dynamic encounter within the same sector to the next one.</p><p>The said, I adore most of the encounters in the Senate Plaza, which is where I\'m always passing through when I exit my stronghold, and I basically never pass on an opportunity to set off some fireworks or to help clean up the party\'s aftermath.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/s1920/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Fireworks going off at the Senate Plaza on Coruscant" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/w400-h225/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Negatives are that some of the Black Sun and Justicar encounters don\'t have nearly enough clickies if there\'s even more than one person trying to do the encounter at the same time, the way Ugnaught Engineering was horrifically bugged when it first came out and made people get into fights about who was supposedly <i>causing</i> it to bug, stealing kills or whatever (regardless of whether it was true or not), and the one encounter on the Senate Plaza that I don\'t like, "Understaffed". Like with "Powder Keg", you can tell someone just wanted to try something different there, but the final result is just too undercooked, with a tutorial mode that teaches you to do things <i>the wrong way</i>, and people being able to ruin the encounter for each other - both intentionally and unintentionally -&nbsp;which is never a good thing.</p><p><b>3. Tython&nbsp;</b></p><p>Next we have the starter planets, which I think are all pretty similar in quality, and I don\'t feel particularly strongly about the order in which I\'ve ranked them against each other. The main reason I consider them worse than the capital planets it that there are very few encounters, so you\'ll run out of things to do pretty quickly if you\'re just trying to grind on a single planet, and that none of the DEs on the starter planets give Conquest points. I can see why the devs decided to have that limitation, but it still means that for someone who\'s very Conquest-focused like me, they tend to have a lot less replay value.</p><p>With that general preamble out of the way, Tython is definitely my favourite of the bunch, since it\'s my favourite of all the starter planets and I think all its dynamic encounters are very on point, whether you\'re doing simple chores at the Jedi Temple or beating back the flesh raiders.</p><p>The only thing I\'ll say is that I do wonder a little how having a dynamic encounter pop up the moment you leave your intro phase is going to affect new players\' perception of the planet and the game as a whole, and whether it might make things come off as a bit "loud" and overwhelming to less experienced gamers. I would love to have insight into the devs\' behavioural metrics on the starter planets for that one...&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>4. Hutta</b></p><p>Hutta is actually one of my least favourite planets, generally speaking, but I think in terms of dynamic encounters it works well enough. Again, the themes of the encounters go very well with what\'s also conveyed via the existing side missions, from dangerous wildlife to rebellious evocii.</p><p>The only thing I\'m not so sure about is having an encounter that is basically a vehicle quest right outside the spawn phase, because it makes me wonder whether that isn\'t a bit confusing/overwhelming for new players. Even if seeing a bunch of droids enter the gang wars right outside the Poison Pit <i>does</i> serve to drive home the point that the town is a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/s1920/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A walker on Ord Mantell surrounded by dozens of loot beams" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/w400-h225/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>5. Ord Mantell</b><p></p><p>Ord Mantell is one of two planets where I actually feel like some of the encounters are <i>slightly</i> off in tone. This may very well be my personal bias speaking, as someone who mains a trooper and was instantly scarred by being blamed for the death of Bellis the informant at the hands of the separatists by multiple people, but I always perceived the whole setting with the separatists as very dark and desperate. Even the smuggler story with all its goofiness has a pretty dark turn here with Corso\'s parents being dead because of the separatists and him having that one moment where he wants to execute that random sep in cold blood.</p><p>With that said, I just feel like some of the encounters involving separatists feel a bit too silly. Like that mad scientist type sending you out to shoot separatists with one of his droids? It\'s one thing if there\'s a specific NPC that\'s bit ridiculous when you talk to them, that\'s clearly just that one character, but the fact that you hear the dynamic encounter yells repeated endlessly even when you\'re just driving by gives them a much stronger impact on the mood in my opinion. Might just be me.</p><p><b>6. Korriban</b></p><p>That\'s also the reason why I rate Korriban last of this batch, because again, several of the encounters just feel a <i>bit</i> too goofy to me personally. Don\'t get me wrong, both the Sith warrior and inquisitor stories have plenty of humorous moments even on Korriban, but I still always got the vibe that as a <i>setting</i>, the planet is clearly meant to be very grim, with all the racial purity nonsense and dog-eat-dog behaviour encouraged in the acolytes. Stuff like k\'lor\'slugs running wild around the academy feels more like the kind of hijinx you\'d find in a young adult book series about a magic school. (That said, looking at how busy each planet is, this one actually seems to be very popular with people, so again, this might just be me.)</p><p><b>7. Ilum&nbsp;</b></p><p>Finally, in last place - alas, poor Ilum. I really wanted the addition of dynamic encounters to this planet to feel like a revival for it. I have some fond memories of Ilum from the game\'s early days, even though it felt somewhat unfinished even then, but over time it\'s only ever declined in relevance. Sadly I can\'t say that I feel like dynamic encounters have put it back on people\'s radar, and based on the small number of other people I see doing encounters there, I get the impression that it didn\'t really land for the majority of the population either.</p><p>Good things first: the theming is once again spot-on on this one. They really leaned into the Republic vs. Empire conflict from the original storyline and even added some encounter achievements that are meant to encourage world PvP. (I\'m 99% sure that almost nobody will bother with those, but I appreciate the effort.) On the Western Ice Shelf, they\'ve expanded on the lore of the Tonvarr Pirates that were previously only really relevant during the Gree event. It all works.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/s1920/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Sith Pureblood, surrounded by pets and companions, sits on the stone throne inside Fort Tonvarr" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/w400-h225/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The problem is simply that too many of the encounters are just not very fun. Too many of them have multiple stages and feature a large number of mobs - when sometimes mob-killing isn\'t even part of the main objective, which makes it feel like you\'re just endlessly wading back and forth through constantly respawning mobs to actually get to the next clicky you need. It just feels tedious to the point that my brain keeps trying to forget that Ilum is another planet that has dynamic encounters now and I very rarely even remember to go there.</p><p>All that said, I wanted to also give a shout-out to a change to dynamic encounters in general that came with 7.7 but that I didn\'t see in the patch notes: When they released these new encounters, they changed it so that on staged DEs, you no longer need to complete every single stage by yourself to get credit, but rather you can join in at any time and still get completion. I feel that this has been a great change and has been most noticeable for me during encounters such as the base attacks on Tatooine and Hoth. It used to be that I felt that there was no point in joining in if people were already fighting the stage two walker, as it wouldn\'t give me anything and I\'d just have to restart the encounter from scratch afterwards anyway. Now I\'ll gleefully jump in and help out because I\'ll actually be rewarded for it too, which I think has been a great change.</p><p>How many of the new encounters have you done at this point? And do you agree with my ranking of the planets or not?

I <i>did</i> get both of those things, but as I always do, I have some nits to pick as well.</p><p><b>Story is coming... but later and perhaps less than we\'d hoped</b></p><p>At least when talking with some of my friends, there had been a hope expressed that the next story patch would be one big "catch-up patch" giving us a bigger chunk of story than usual, kind of like how Echoes of Oblivion and Spirit of Vengeance (which were originally supposed to be separate pieces of content) were both released at the same time after delays caused by Covid.</p><p>This... is not going to be the case. 7.8, which will come out before Christmas, will have the "Galactic Threads" story that was originally meant to be included in patch 7.6 last Christmas, and then they\'ll speed up a little bit and add "Master\'s Engima", the story originally built for patch 7.7, with 7.8.1, which should then launch at some point early next year and would usually have included only the start of Galactic Season 10 and no story update.</p><p>While I\'m glad to finally have something close to a date, having to wait another four months or so until the next story drop still hurts - by that point the game will have gone nearly 18 months without a story patch, which is unprecedented in this MMO\'s history.</p><p>The other thing that stuck out to me is that if we\'re getting the story that was meant to be in 7.6 in 7.8, what was meant to be in 7.8 before that? No story? Ultimately it feels like aside from the delays, we also <i>lost</i> one of the twice-a-year story installments due to the strike, which sucks.</p><p>Same thing with date nights by the way - they mentioned working on one back in the 7.6.1 stream, but now we won\'t even get one with 7.7.1, with the next expected release (Torian and Kira) coming with 7.8.1 next year.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Galactic Season 9: Flashpoint Resurgence</b></p><p>As for GS9, its theme is flashpoints. Yippee! There will be Czerka buffs involved like there were for uprisings during GS8, which I don\'t really care about, but I\'m good with running flashpoints with or without buffs. Unfortunately it sounded like the objectives will be veteran mode only, which is a bit disappointing to me personally and will not encourage my guildies to group up I reckon, but still, it\'s flashpoints.</p><p>The most interesting bit of the stream to me personally was the devs talking about how they were using the occasion of this seasonal focus on flashpoints to make some changes to the activity finder. A big quality of life improvement they will make is that you\'ll finally be able to queue as multiple roles again, change roles while queueing (so that you can e.g. do dailies in a dps spec while queueing for a flashpoint as healer) and it will take both of your combat styles into account, meaning you could queue as all <i>three</i> roles if you wanted and have the right combat styles for it. Now, to be clear, only the last bit of that is actually new - both the ability to queue for multiple roles and the ability to queue as a different role than you\'re currently playing were in the game before but got patched out at some point, I think because they were buggy or causing issues of some sort. Still, I\'m very glad to see these features make a comeback at last.</p><p>They are also going to improve the loot you get in flashpoints while levelling, though it\'s not entirely clear what that will mean - I\'m guessing more gear that is actually appropriate for your level and combat style, because getting drops that you can\'t even use or not use for another twenty levels was definitely a thing sometimes.</p><p>For the max levels, you\'ll no longer have to queue for all flashpoints to be eligible for additional daily/weekly rewards, but can exclude a few that you may want to avoid. You still won\'t be rewarded for just spamming Hammer Station and nothing else, but you can untick a couple you don\'t like, which I guess is nice.&nbsp;</p><p><b>No more "spacebar plz"</b></p><p>The thing that kind of shocked me was that in connection to all these flashpoint changes, queued veteran and master mode flashpoints will no longer feature any cut scenes or group conversations; everything will just be auto-skipped and if there was some sort of decision to be made (such as whether to kill or spare the captain in the Black Talon) it will just do so automatically. If you want to see the conversations and cut scenes in the future, you\'ll need to do story mode (where available) or manually walk into the higher difficulty with some friends.</p><p>Now, I completely understand why they are doing this and I\'m sure many people will consider this a major quality of life improvement. I made a whole <a href="https://youtu.be/7Wy2EA4fZrQ?si=CP0QdGpEjH5tDKy6&amp;t=144">compilation poking fun at people\'s urge to skip the cut scenes</a> <i>seven years ago</i>. I\'ve seen it all, from the guy who drops group the moment you zone into the Esseles or Black Talon, to endless arguments about who isn\'t hitting their space bar and why. It was a source of friction for sure.</p><p>AND YET. I myself have always loved the group conversations in flashpoints and was generally happy to watch cut scenes if other people wanted to do so too. I enjoy running flashpoints, but I never "spammed" them to the point where getting the Esseles again made me frustrated. (The only flashpoint that I\'ve managed to get utterly sick of is Hammer Station, and that has nothing to do with cut scenes and everything to do with the community.)</p><p>I also felt that the group conversations often inspired fun little interactions, such as when a dark or light side choice got people chatting. My guildies have seen me express (not-entirely-serious) outrage at killing the engineers or leaving Asara behind in the Esseles more than a few times. And some of the cut scenes also just genuinely looked nice! I have a whole collection of screenshots of pugs in Czerka Corporate Labs, from that last cut scene that shows your group walking into the room looking heroic.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s1741/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Four SWTOR characters about to face down the last boss in Czerka Corporate Labs.

Telling me that you can <i>technically</i> build a group manually and walk in to still see the cut scenes is a bit of a cold comfort because let\'s be real, how often do people do that? How often have you run Kuat Drive Yards since it was removed from the group finder? I just feel like this is going to be one of those things that will end up having negative ripple effects that people won\'t fully feel until later down the line. Or maybe I\'m just a relic of ancient times for having actually enjoyed interacting with my pug mates in small ways, even if there was friction sometimes.</p><p><b>Be free, F2P-ers!</b></p><p>A big change for free-to-play players that\'s coming with the next patch is that the devs will be dropping a <i>lot</i> of the old restrictions on that type of account. You will now also get sprint at level 1,&nbsp;have all action bars unlocked,&nbsp;be able to hide your head slot&nbsp; and equip random purples that you get while levelling. Honestly, with some of the things they mentioned I didn\'t even know there were restrictions for that: What, F2P players couldn\'t display legacy titles before? Or equip companion customisations? WTF?</p><p>Even as someone who\'s always been subscribed, I think this is great news. SWTOR has had a reputation for having extremely draconian F2P restrictions for a long time - I remember how the limited action bars were a source of ridicule across the entire MMO community when the game first went free-to-play. I think the devs did the right thing by being cautious when they first changed payment model back in the day (mostly because other MMOs that followed suit later and kept crowing about how much more generous their F2P model was in comparison, such as Rift and Wildstar, did ultimately not end up doing well).</p><p>However, all of that was over a decade ago, times have changed, and there\'s just no reason to be quite so brutal with all those restrictions on what\'s effectively the game\'s free trial mode.

I <i>did</i> get both of those things, but as I always do, I have some nits to pick as well.</p><p><b>Story is coming... but later and perhaps less than we\'d hoped</b></p><p>At least when talking with some of my friends, there had been a hope expressed that the next story patch would be one big "catch-up patch" giving us a bigger chunk of story than usual, kind of like how Echoes of Oblivion and Spirit of Vengeance (which were originally supposed to be separate pieces of content) were both released at the same time after delays caused by Covid.</p><p>This... is not going to be the case. 7.8, which will come out before Christmas, will have the "Galactic Threads" story that was originally meant to be included in patch 7.6 last Christmas, and then they\'ll speed up a little bit and add "Master\'s Engima", the story originally built for patch 7.7, with 7.8.1, which should then launch at some point early next year and would usually have included only the start of Galactic Season 10 and no story update.</p><p>While I\'m glad to finally have something close to a date, having to wait another four months or so until the next story drop still hurts - by that point the game will have gone nearly 18 months without a story patch, which is unprecedented in this MMO\'s history.</p><p>The other thing that stuck out to me is that if we\'re getting the story that was meant to be in 7.6 in 7.8, what was meant to be in 7.8 before that? No story? Ultimately it feels like aside from the delays, we also <i>lost</i> one of the twice-a-year story installments due to the strike, which sucks.</p><p>Same thing with date nights by the way - they mentioned working on one back in the 7.6.1 stream, but now we won\'t even get one with 7.7.1, with the next expected release (Torian and Kira) coming with 7.8.1 next year.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Galactic Season 9: Flashpoint Resurgence</b></p><p>As for GS9, its theme is flashpoints. Yippee! There will be Czerka buffs involved like there were for uprisings during GS8, which I don\'t really care about, but I\'m good with running flashpoints with or without buffs. Unfortunately it sounded like the objectives will be veteran mode only, which is a bit disappointing to me personally and will not encourage my guildies to group up I reckon, but still, it\'s flashpoints.</p><p>The most interesting bit of the stream to me personally was the devs talking about how they were using the occasion of this seasonal focus on flashpoints to make some changes to the activity finder. A big quality of life improvement they will make is that you\'ll finally be able to queue as multiple roles again, change roles while queueing (so that you can e.g. do dailies in a dps spec while queueing for a flashpoint as healer) and it will take both of your combat styles into account, meaning you could queue as all <i>three</i> roles if you wanted and have the right combat styles for it. Now, to be clear, only the last bit of that is actually new - both the ability to queue for multiple roles and the ability to queue as a different role than you\'re currently playing were in the game before but got patched out at some point, I think because they were buggy or causing issues of some sort. Still, I\'m very glad to see these features make a comeback at last.</p><p>They are also going to improve the loot you get in flashpoints while levelling, though it\'s not entirely clear what that will mean - I\'m guessing more gear that is actually appropriate for your level and combat style, because getting drops that you can\'t even use or not use for another twenty levels was definitely a thing sometimes.</p><p>For the max levels, you\'ll no longer have to queue for all flashpoints to be eligible for additional daily/weekly rewards, but can exclude a few that you may want to avoid. You still won\'t be rewarded for just spamming Hammer Station and nothing else, but you can untick a couple you don\'t like, which I guess is nice.&nbsp;</p><p><b>No more "spacebar plz"</b></p><p>The thing that kind of shocked me was that in connection to all these flashpoint changes, queued veteran and master mode flashpoints will no longer feature any cut scenes or group conversations; everything will just be auto-skipped and if there was some sort of decision to be made (such as whether to kill or spare the captain in the Black Talon) it will just do so automatically. If you want to see the conversations and cut scenes in the future, you\'ll need to do story mode (where available) or manually walk into the higher difficulty with some friends.</p><p>Now, I completely understand why they are doing this and I\'m sure many people will consider this a major quality of life improvement. I made a whole <a href="https://youtu.be/7Wy2EA4fZrQ?si=CP0QdGpEjH5tDKy6&amp;t=144">compilation poking fun at people\'s urge to skip the cut scenes</a> <i>seven years ago</i>. I\'ve seen it all, from the guy who drops group the moment you zone into the Esseles or Black Talon, to endless arguments about who isn\'t hitting their space bar and why. It was a source of friction for sure.</p><p>AND YET. I myself have always loved the group conversations in flashpoints and was generally happy to watch cut scenes if other people wanted to do so too. I enjoy running flashpoints, but I never "spammed" them to the point where getting the Esseles again made me frustrated. (The only flashpoint that I\'ve managed to get utterly sick of is Hammer Station, and that has nothing to do with cut scenes and everything to do with the community.)</p><p>I also felt that the group conversations often inspired fun little interactions, such as when a dark or light side choice got people chatting. My guildies have seen me express (not-entirely-serious) outrage at killing the engineers or leaving Asara behind in the Esseles more than a few times. And some of the cut scenes also just genuinely looked nice! I have a whole collection of screenshots of pugs in Czerka Corporate Labs, from that last cut scene that shows your group walking into the room looking heroic.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s1741/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Four SWTOR characters about to face down the last boss in Czerka Corporate Labs.

Telling me that you can <i>technically</i> build a group manually and walk in to still see the cut scenes is a bit of a cold comfort because let\'s be real, how often do people do that? How often have you run Kuat Drive Yards since it was removed from the group finder? I just feel like this is going to be one of those things that will end up having negative ripple effects that people won\'t fully feel until later down the line. Or maybe I\'m just a relic of ancient times for having actually enjoyed interacting with my pug mates in small ways, even if there was friction sometimes.</p><p><b>Be free, F2P-ers!</b></p><p>A big change for free-to-play players that\'s coming with the next patch is that the devs will be dropping a <i>lot</i> of the old restrictions on that type of account. You will now also get sprint at level 1,&nbsp;have all action bars unlocked,&nbsp;be able to hide your head slot&nbsp; and equip random purples that you get while levelling. Honestly, with some of the things they mentioned I didn\'t even know there were restrictions for that: What, F2P players couldn\'t display legacy titles before? Or equip companion customisations? WTF?</p><p>Even as someone who\'s always been subscribed, I think this is great news. SWTOR has had a reputation for having extremely draconian F2P restrictions for a long time - I remember how the limited action bars were a source of ridicule across the entire MMO community when the game first went free-to-play. I think the devs did the right thing by being cautious when they first changed payment model back in the day (mostly because other MMOs that followed suit later and kept crowing about how much more generous their F2P model was in comparison, such as Rift and Wildstar, did ultimately not end up doing well).</p><p>However, all of that was over a decade ago, times have changed, and there\'s just no reason to be quite so brutal with all those restrictions on what\'s effectively the game\'s free trial mode. Annoying players with arbitrary feature locks before they\'ve even left the starter planet was just never great, and I hope that these changes will give more people a chance to actually fall in love with what the game has to offer and then spend some money on it happily instead of feeling nagged from the get-go.</p><p><b>What about subscribers though?</b></p><p>So as not to leave subscribers feeling unappreciated, the game will run a new "subscriber login event" from September to December where you\'ll earn a special currency if you log in at least four times a week, which you can then use to buy some goodies.

The standout among these is probably <a href="https://newoutriders.org/">New Outriders</a>, a multi-gaming guild/community that has its SWTOR branch on Star Forge and in which <a href="https://www.generic-hero.com/ThisWeekinAurabesh/">Intisar</a> is an officer.</p><p>I don\'t get to actually interact with the people there that often because of time zones, but when I do it\'s always cordial, and on the rare occasion when they have an event in the afternoon in their time zone, meaning that I can join in as well, I\'m always excited.</p><p>Yesterday was one such occasion, and it started off in a way that was very flattering to me, as Intisar instructed me to come online a bit early, declaring that a few people would help me get the last three DvL boss kills I was still missing on Star Forge. So we did that, and it wasn\'t actually too painful, even on Hoth! The GS8 achievement for the boss kills by itself doesn\'t actually give anything worthwhile, but it turns out the original achievement to kill all the bosses from back in Knights of the Eternal Throne is also still active, so that triggered as well and I got lots of banner decos for it, which was nice.</p><p>This was also a good example of one of the things I do love about joining events on Star Forge - there I\'m just another member and can rely on other people to carry me a bit. I don\'t mind being an officer in Twin Suns Squadron, but it <i>is</i> also work sometimes, and only the day before I\'d been making lists and parking summon alts all over the place to help my guildies there tick off <i>their</i> last few achievements, so it was a nice change of pace to have someone do the same for me, you know?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVw8dP8fXBz4yQQtIZhFVvPhXYTxUU4Z-OCgTsJOOAdQDs9hM5cuFu4IhHZX0oWXubJYshpIFlV1Y8UEy2ypD_jPIZ0MHPLpG517u5gR1Bb-poUe7zB1bb2hHE1oJReUTUvz4aFaAs00LW4FPlS3uFF7Tj1zn70r9tnXAxCXxHOqjL92Sx3PizfLJIbfA/s1920/New%20Outriders%20dancing%20on%20Quesh.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Members of New Outriders dancing near the Quesh world boss, with fireworks going off" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVw8dP8fXBz4yQQtIZhFVvPhXYTxUU4Z-OCgTsJOOAdQDs9hM5cuFu4IhHZX0oWXubJYshpIFlV1Y8UEy2ypD_jPIZ0MHPLpG517u5gR1Bb-poUe7zB1bb2hHE1oJReUTUvz4aFaAs00LW4FPlS3uFF7Tj1zn70r9tnXAxCXxHOqjL92Sx3PizfLJIbfA/w400-h225/New%20Outriders%20dancing%20on%20Quesh.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Anyway, once the event got started properly, a lot more people came online, including a couple of the officers from the wider community that clearly hadn\'t played SWTOR in a while. I got quite wide-eyed inspecting them, with one of their characters being level 55 and the other one 75. It was like looking at a time capsule! I think I must have gasped lines like "OMG, he\'s got an Oriconian ear piece" out loud at my screen at one point.<p></p><p>The event itself was a very casual-friendly affair open to all levels that involved travelling across various planets, killing world bosses, collecting datacrons and just generally having a bit of fun. I was pretty impressed by how even though there was never a dull moment, I couldn\'t quite tell how much of it had been planned and how much was spontaneous. The characters that had been parked next to difficult-to-reach datacrons had obviously been prepared with intent, but other times we\'d arrive on the scene of a dynamic encounter and Intisar would just go "oh, this one is fun" and we\'d all do it together and I figure that can\'t possibly have been planned that way? I don\'t know.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghVbDsxD1wlhPRmUtPP6_DQqMLCxuGAjpXIzDQtOKkhzcpin3TeYvxbsy46egAteBtYY0KqGl_fTcmIz_yXIIqgYe3rcQ0a_A9Xuwc4VMmknA_eDqCwXnCGWWHtS94Ee4bWDOM728-KWPkdz3oadia0gF8r6ySdoCwrGBe_PBDoqVXOPZ-XXRwrXbTq14/s1920/New%20Outriders%20in%20walkers%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A bunch of walkers stand around in a circle during the Ord Mantell dynamic encounter &quot;Power Walking&quot;" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghVbDsxD1wlhPRmUtPP6_DQqMLCxuGAjpXIzDQtOKkhzcpin3TeYvxbsy46egAteBtYY0KqGl_fTcmIz_yXIIqgYe3rcQ0a_A9Xuwc4VMmknA_eDqCwXnCGWWHtS94Ee4bWDOM728-KWPkdz3oadia0gF8r6ySdoCwrGBe_PBDoqVXOPZ-XXRwrXbTq14/w400-h225/New%20Outriders%20in%20walkers%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The most whimsical detour was when we got to Tython and Intisar beckoned everyone to join him at the planet\'s 0,0 coordinate to marvel at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/q9wc5e/anyone_know_what_is_this/">the strange floating orb of light there</a>. It\'s funny how something that\'s clearly just a random bug has developed into a kind of mysterious attraction and people like to make up their own lore about how the Uxibeast next to the flame must be Force-sensitive or something.</p><p>Since there were no level requirements for the event, I took part using my little Sage alt who had only just earned her own ship (that part was required to be able to accept summons) and she gained no fewer than five levels from gallivanting around the galaxy and trying to take part in killing world bosses. Plus she got a lot of random creature codexes from when people around her decided to kill all the wildlife in the vicinity.</p><p>It was just very wholesome and I\'m always kind of impressed by the joyful energy everyone in the guild still displays while playing the game, even when they\'re off to kill the Coruscant world boss for what must be the 100th time. It probably helps that they have a seemingly endless supply of in-jokes that sometimes make my head spin, including every boss and their abilities having special made-up names.

The standout among these is probably <a href="https://newoutriders.org/">New Outriders</a>, a multi-gaming guild/community that has its SWTOR branch on Star Forge and in which <a href="https://www.generic-hero.com/ThisWeekinAurabesh/">Intisar</a> is an officer.</p><p>I don\'t get to actually interact with the people there that often because of time zones, but when I do it\'s always cordial, and on the rare occasion when they have an event in the afternoon in their time zone, meaning that I can join in as well, I\'m always excited.</p><p>Yesterday was one such occasion, and it started off in a way that was very flattering to me, as Intisar instructed me to come online a bit early, declaring that a few people would help me get the last three DvL boss kills I was still missing on Star Forge. So we did that, and it wasn\'t actually too painful, even on Hoth! The GS8 achievement for the boss kills by itself doesn\'t actually give anything worthwhile, but it turns out the original achievement to kill all the bosses from back in Knights of the Eternal Throne is also still active, so that triggered as well and I got lots of banner decos for it, which was nice.</p><p>This was also a good example of one of the things I do love about joining events on Star Forge - there I\'m just another member and can rely on other people to carry me a bit. I don\'t mind being an officer in Twin Suns Squadron, but it <i>is</i> also work sometimes, and only the day before I\'d been making lists and parking summon alts all over the place to help my guildies there tick off <i>their</i> last few achievements, so it was a nice change of pace to have someone do the same for me, you know?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVw8dP8fXBz4yQQtIZhFVvPhXYTxUU4Z-OCgTsJOOAdQDs9hM5cuFu4IhHZX0oWXubJYshpIFlV1Y8UEy2ypD_jPIZ0MHPLpG517u5gR1Bb-poUe7zB1bb2hHE1oJReUTUvz4aFaAs00LW4FPlS3uFF7Tj1zn70r9tnXAxCXxHOqjL92Sx3PizfLJIbfA/s1920/New%20Outriders%20dancing%20on%20Quesh.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Members of New Outriders dancing near the Quesh world boss, with fireworks going off" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVw8dP8fXBz4yQQtIZhFVvPhXYTxUU4Z-OCgTsJOOAdQDs9hM5cuFu4IhHZX0oWXubJYshpIFlV1Y8UEy2ypD_jPIZ0MHPLpG517u5gR1Bb-poUe7zB1bb2hHE1oJReUTUvz4aFaAs00LW4FPlS3uFF7Tj1zn70r9tnXAxCXxHOqjL92Sx3PizfLJIbfA/w400-h225/New%20Outriders%20dancing%20on%20Quesh.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Anyway, once the event got started properly, a lot more people came online, including a couple of the officers from the wider community that clearly hadn\'t played SWTOR in a while. I got quite wide-eyed inspecting them, with one of their characters being level 55 and the other one 75. It was like looking at a time capsule! I think I must have gasped lines like "OMG, he\'s got an Oriconian ear piece" out loud at my screen at one point.<p></p><p>The event itself was a very casual-friendly affair open to all levels that involved travelling across various planets, killing world bosses, collecting datacrons and just generally having a bit of fun. I was pretty impressed by how even though there was never a dull moment, I couldn\'t quite tell how much of it had been planned and how much was spontaneous. The characters that had been parked next to difficult-to-reach datacrons had obviously been prepared with intent, but other times we\'d arrive on the scene of a dynamic encounter and Intisar would just go "oh, this one is fun" and we\'d all do it together and I figure that can\'t possibly have been planned that way? I don\'t know.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghVbDsxD1wlhPRmUtPP6_DQqMLCxuGAjpXIzDQtOKkhzcpin3TeYvxbsy46egAteBtYY0KqGl_fTcmIz_yXIIqgYe3rcQ0a_A9Xuwc4VMmknA_eDqCwXnCGWWHtS94Ee4bWDOM728-KWPkdz3oadia0gF8r6ySdoCwrGBe_PBDoqVXOPZ-XXRwrXbTq14/s1920/New%20Outriders%20in%20walkers%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A bunch of walkers stand around in a circle during the Ord Mantell dynamic encounter &quot;Power Walking&quot;" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghVbDsxD1wlhPRmUtPP6_DQqMLCxuGAjpXIzDQtOKkhzcpin3TeYvxbsy46egAteBtYY0KqGl_fTcmIz_yXIIqgYe3rcQ0a_A9Xuwc4VMmknA_eDqCwXnCGWWHtS94Ee4bWDOM728-KWPkdz3oadia0gF8r6ySdoCwrGBe_PBDoqVXOPZ-XXRwrXbTq14/w400-h225/New%20Outriders%20in%20walkers%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The most whimsical detour was when we got to Tython and Intisar beckoned everyone to join him at the planet\'s 0,0 coordinate to marvel at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/q9wc5e/anyone_know_what_is_this/">the strange floating orb of light there</a>. It\'s funny how something that\'s clearly just a random bug has developed into a kind of mysterious attraction and people like to make up their own lore about how the Uxibeast next to the flame must be Force-sensitive or something.</p><p>Since there were no level requirements for the event, I took part using my little Sage alt who had only just earned her own ship (that part was required to be able to accept summons) and she gained no fewer than five levels from gallivanting around the galaxy and trying to take part in killing world bosses. Plus she got a lot of random creature codexes from when people around her decided to kill all the wildlife in the vicinity.</p><p>It was just very wholesome and I\'m always kind of impressed by the joyful energy everyone in the guild still displays while playing the game, even when they\'re off to kill the Coruscant world boss for what must be the 100th time. It probably helps that they have a seemingly endless supply of in-jokes that sometimes make my head spin, including every boss and their abilities having special made-up names.

I\'m not going to rehash once again what that is or why it\'s important to me - if you need a refresher, I recommend reading one or both of these posts:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>April 2024: <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/04/at-token-war-with-czech-empire.html">At (Token) War with the Czech Empire</a></li><li>December 2024: <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/12/living-degen-conquest-life.html">Living the Degen Conquest Life</a></li></ul><p>The two Conquest events recounted in the above posts taught my guild two important lessons: The first one was that Personal Conquest Requisitions have been a game-changer for small to medium guilds that are willing to plan for the long term, and the second one was that there were even more ways to game that system than simply saving them up over time. I didn\'t mention it in those posts at the time, but one guildie who ended up popping a particularly large number of tokens to help us achieve victory admitted that she had used a character transfer to shuttle in extra Requisitions from another server, where she\'d been collecting them from her login rewards on the side.</p><p>Now, for additional context, my guild successfully conquered every single available planet at some point over the last decade - with one notable exception: Belsavis. For some reason that one <i>always</i> seemed to be taken by a top five guild that we couldn\'t possibly beat, even during Total Galactic War. I\'m not sure why that is, but I can only guess that Belsavis might not come up as often in the rotation as other planets. A planet like Tatooine for example is tied to the Death Mark Conquest event, which in turn is tied to Bounty Contract Week and comes around once a month. Belsavis on the other hand is only available during Emergency Operations and The Dread War (outside of Total Galactic War), two events that don\'t seem to get slotted into the rotation very often.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiynfkO8DKwSt-WV0hG4eCNCQHK67LN3Ciwtoh_E47mPQ0n_VffdqsaVZl_Vz8lh2fdaky2xqnWCnUA274GdLMzvzara6euEjX0vMSXG2poRELBn718-BblOF9zy1fTUKadZu0EaIxcDhIrueM9ZWualWypASkgD0GKjP8-2ZObDy0dB9Q4zPLZ_J-e3EY/s1920/Shintar%20on%20Belsavis%20with%20Galaxy%20Conqueror%20legacy%20title.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Shintar the trooper on her Kath Hound mount on Belsavis, proudly displaying her Dread Master title and Galaxy Conqueror legacy title" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiynfkO8DKwSt-WV0hG4eCNCQHK67LN3Ciwtoh_E47mPQ0n_VffdqsaVZl_Vz8lh2fdaky2xqnWCnUA274GdLMzvzara6euEjX0vMSXG2poRELBn718-BblOF9zy1fTUKadZu0EaIxcDhIrueM9ZWualWypASkgD0GKjP8-2ZObDy0dB9Q4zPLZ_J-e3EY/w400-h225/Shintar%20on%20Belsavis%20with%20Galaxy%20Conqueror%20legacy%20title.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Combining what we learned about Personal Conquest Requisitions and our growing frustration with being unable to lay claim to the <i>one</i> planet people still needed for the Galaxy Conqueror achievement, the biggest Conquest fan in the guild eventually proposed the following: that one of these weeks, we should just pool <i>all</i> our resources from <i>all</i> the servers (he and I both do Galactic Seasons on all servers) and simply go for Belsavis anyway.</p><p>I did some maths around this suggestion initially, and while I kind of liked the boldness of it, it still seemed a little too crazy. We had a lot of Requisitions saved up, but not <i>that</i> many.</p><p>Anyway, last week\'s Total Galactic War arrived and the matter was brought up again. Looking at the scoreboard, all the biggest guilds had committed early for a change, and the guild in the lead on Belsavis was none other than our frenemies the Czech Empire. They were not a top five guild, and <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/04/at-token-war-with-czech-empire.html">we\'d beaten them before</a>... but it had also been the fight of a lifetime, and they were the reason we were so acutely aware of the power of Personal Conquest Requisitions in the first place, so there was no chance that we\'d be able to surprise them.</p><p>I quickly had a look at possible alternative invasion targets (that we had conquered in the past but that newer members would\'ve liked us to conquer again) but nothing stood out as an easy or obvious option, so after a bit of deliberation I decided to commit us to Belsavis. We agreed that we\'d hold off on using any tokens for now and that we\'d play it by ear, deciding our next steps later in the week depending on how it went.</p><p>Interestingly, it went quite differently than a year ago. Back then, we\'d overtaken the Czechs quickly, and they\'d been quite happy to trail us for the rest of the week with a steady ten million point gap between us. This time, they\'d clearly made a push on launch day to get a solid lead from the beginning, and they did not want us to catch them. We were about three million behind by the end of the first day and I figured that this was a difference we should be able to make up quickly enough, but <i>somehow</i> we couldn\'t quite get there. In fact, by Thursday morning the Czechs had grown their lead to seven million, and by evening we were <i>sixteen</i> million points behind them.</p><p>There was a time when being that far behind would\'ve been reason enough for us to fold, but I knew that the game wasn\'t quite over yet this time, as the other Conquest guy and I - <i>if</i> we went ahead with the server transfers - would have over 50 million points in tokens at our disposal. We did discuss amongst ourselves that if they kept gaining points at the same rate we\'d likely have to give up, but for the time being, we kept going.</p><p>Even though I knew that we had a plan, it was honestly a bit demotivating to keep grinding away when we were so far behind. I heard more than one defeatist comment from guildies but still did my best to counter the psychological warfare. I basically told everyone that we\'d let them know once the battle was lost, but as of now it wasn\'t over yet and they just had to trust me and keep going. (People knew about the saved up Conquest Requisitions, but I didn\'t tell anyone outside the leadership circle about the exact numbers since we\'re not very strict about removing people from our Discord for inactivity, and I was paranoid about information getting leaked to the competition somehow.)</p><p>And it seemed to work! While people weren\'t necessarily in the best of spirits, they kept at it. At its worst, the Czech\'s lead grew to around 18 million points, but they only maintained that for a brief while and most of the time the gap between us seemed to hover between ten and sixteen million.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/s1920/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot of a party fighting the last boss in the Landing Party uprising" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/w400-h225/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Then the weekend came and with it a sudden and unexpected burst of energy. (I think I\'m actually starting to notice a trend here, that my guild is better at Conquest in the second half of the week than in the first half.)</p><p>An officer that had been on hiatus for months popped his head in the door, asked how Total Galactic War was going and quickly ground out a half-million points in one evening. Another guild member who hasn\'t really been playing SWTOR in a while piped up to say that he had the week off and fancied randomly lending us a hand with grinding points. The funniest moment to me personally was when another guy who hadn\'t logged in in months showed up on Monday evening and we had a conversation that went something like this (paraphrased):</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Me: Look at you, logging in for the first time since the last Total Galactic War! [I could tell because on log-in he triggered the "Conqueror of Oricon" achievement.]</li><li>Him: Hah, you got me there. Would you like me to pop some tokens?</li><li>Me: How do you even have any? You haven\'t been online and you said you popped them all last time.</li><li>Him: Oops, I guess I lied.</li></ul><p>All of Sunday afternoon and evening the guild was absolutely buzzing with activity and achievements were popping left and right as people went out of their comfort zone and tried content they hadn\'t done before in order to earn Conquest points. Guild PvP was more active than it had been in months and there was plenty of banter. Point gains aside, it was a joy to see.</p><p>We could see that the Czechs were active in the evening and trying to bolster their score with some planetary rampaging, but we actually had a similar number of people online and were absolutely on fire. By the end of the evening, the gap between us was down to less than ten million.</p><p>I expected Monday to be more quiet, so I was both pleasantly surprised and had a good laugh when I decided to do a quick check-in on Monday morning and saw seven people online in guild. Clearly our members were less constrained by work than I\'d expected.</p><p>We continued Sunday\'s trend at a slightly slower pace and the gap between us and first place continued to shrink all day. By the time the last person went to bed we were only about a million points behind.</p><p>Tuesday I was working from home and I had put a bit of time aside around the end of Conquest to pop my Personal Conquest Requisitions as needed.

I\'m not going to rehash once again what that is or why it\'s important to me - if you need a refresher, I recommend reading one or both of these posts:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>April 2024: <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/04/at-token-war-with-czech-empire.html">At (Token) War with the Czech Empire</a></li><li>December 2024: <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/12/living-degen-conquest-life.html">Living the Degen Conquest Life</a></li></ul><p>The two Conquest events recounted in the above posts taught my guild two important lessons: The first one was that Personal Conquest Requisitions have been a game-changer for small to medium guilds that are willing to plan for the long term, and the second one was that there were even more ways to game that system than simply saving them up over time. I didn\'t mention it in those posts at the time, but one guildie who ended up popping a particularly large number of tokens to help us achieve victory admitted that she had used a character transfer to shuttle in extra Requisitions from another server, where she\'d been collecting them from her login rewards on the side.</p><p>Now, for additional context, my guild successfully conquered every single available planet at some point over the last decade - with one notable exception: Belsavis. For some reason that one <i>always</i> seemed to be taken by a top five guild that we couldn\'t possibly beat, even during Total Galactic War. I\'m not sure why that is, but I can only guess that Belsavis might not come up as often in the rotation as other planets. A planet like Tatooine for example is tied to the Death Mark Conquest event, which in turn is tied to Bounty Contract Week and comes around once a month. Belsavis on the other hand is only available during Emergency Operations and The Dread War (outside of Total Galactic War), two events that don\'t seem to get slotted into the rotation very often.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiynfkO8DKwSt-WV0hG4eCNCQHK67LN3Ciwtoh_E47mPQ0n_VffdqsaVZl_Vz8lh2fdaky2xqnWCnUA274GdLMzvzara6euEjX0vMSXG2poRELBn718-BblOF9zy1fTUKadZu0EaIxcDhIrueM9ZWualWypASkgD0GKjP8-2ZObDy0dB9Q4zPLZ_J-e3EY/s1920/Shintar%20on%20Belsavis%20with%20Galaxy%20Conqueror%20legacy%20title.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Shintar the trooper on her Kath Hound mount on Belsavis, proudly displaying her Dread Master title and Galaxy Conqueror legacy title" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiynfkO8DKwSt-WV0hG4eCNCQHK67LN3Ciwtoh_E47mPQ0n_VffdqsaVZl_Vz8lh2fdaky2xqnWCnUA274GdLMzvzara6euEjX0vMSXG2poRELBn718-BblOF9zy1fTUKadZu0EaIxcDhIrueM9ZWualWypASkgD0GKjP8-2ZObDy0dB9Q4zPLZ_J-e3EY/w400-h225/Shintar%20on%20Belsavis%20with%20Galaxy%20Conqueror%20legacy%20title.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Combining what we learned about Personal Conquest Requisitions and our growing frustration with being unable to lay claim to the <i>one</i> planet people still needed for the Galaxy Conqueror achievement, the biggest Conquest fan in the guild eventually proposed the following: that one of these weeks, we should just pool <i>all</i> our resources from <i>all</i> the servers (he and I both do Galactic Seasons on all servers) and simply go for Belsavis anyway.</p><p>I did some maths around this suggestion initially, and while I kind of liked the boldness of it, it still seemed a little too crazy. We had a lot of Requisitions saved up, but not <i>that</i> many.</p><p>Anyway, last week\'s Total Galactic War arrived and the matter was brought up again. Looking at the scoreboard, all the biggest guilds had committed early for a change, and the guild in the lead on Belsavis was none other than our frenemies the Czech Empire. They were not a top five guild, and <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/04/at-token-war-with-czech-empire.html">we\'d beaten them before</a>... but it had also been the fight of a lifetime, and they were the reason we were so acutely aware of the power of Personal Conquest Requisitions in the first place, so there was no chance that we\'d be able to surprise them.</p><p>I quickly had a look at possible alternative invasion targets (that we had conquered in the past but that newer members would\'ve liked us to conquer again) but nothing stood out as an easy or obvious option, so after a bit of deliberation I decided to commit us to Belsavis. We agreed that we\'d hold off on using any tokens for now and that we\'d play it by ear, deciding our next steps later in the week depending on how it went.</p><p>Interestingly, it went quite differently than a year ago. Back then, we\'d overtaken the Czechs quickly, and they\'d been quite happy to trail us for the rest of the week with a steady ten million point gap between us. This time, they\'d clearly made a push on launch day to get a solid lead from the beginning, and they did not want us to catch them. We were about three million behind by the end of the first day and I figured that this was a difference we should be able to make up quickly enough, but <i>somehow</i> we couldn\'t quite get there. In fact, by Thursday morning the Czechs had grown their lead to seven million, and by evening we were <i>sixteen</i> million points behind them.</p><p>There was a time when being that far behind would\'ve been reason enough for us to fold, but I knew that the game wasn\'t quite over yet this time, as the other Conquest guy and I - <i>if</i> we went ahead with the server transfers - would have over 50 million points in tokens at our disposal. We did discuss amongst ourselves that if they kept gaining points at the same rate we\'d likely have to give up, but for the time being, we kept going.</p><p>Even though I knew that we had a plan, it was honestly a bit demotivating to keep grinding away when we were so far behind. I heard more than one defeatist comment from guildies but still did my best to counter the psychological warfare. I basically told everyone that we\'d let them know once the battle was lost, but as of now it wasn\'t over yet and they just had to trust me and keep going. (People knew about the saved up Conquest Requisitions, but I didn\'t tell anyone outside the leadership circle about the exact numbers since we\'re not very strict about removing people from our Discord for inactivity, and I was paranoid about information getting leaked to the competition somehow.)</p><p>And it seemed to work! While people weren\'t necessarily in the best of spirits, they kept at it. At its worst, the Czech\'s lead grew to around 18 million points, but they only maintained that for a brief while and most of the time the gap between us seemed to hover between ten and sixteen million.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/s1920/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot of a party fighting the last boss in the Landing Party uprising" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/w400-h225/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Then the weekend came and with it a sudden and unexpected burst of energy. (I think I\'m actually starting to notice a trend here, that my guild is better at Conquest in the second half of the week than in the first half.)</p><p>An officer that had been on hiatus for months popped his head in the door, asked how Total Galactic War was going and quickly ground out a half-million points in one evening. Another guild member who hasn\'t really been playing SWTOR in a while piped up to say that he had the week off and fancied randomly lending us a hand with grinding points. The funniest moment to me personally was when another guy who hadn\'t logged in in months showed up on Monday evening and we had a conversation that went something like this (paraphrased):</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Me: Look at you, logging in for the first time since the last Total Galactic War! [I could tell because on log-in he triggered the "Conqueror of Oricon" achievement.]</li><li>Him: Hah, you got me there. Would you like me to pop some tokens?</li><li>Me: How do you even have any? You haven\'t been online and you said you popped them all last time.</li><li>Him: Oops, I guess I lied.</li></ul><p>All of Sunday afternoon and evening the guild was absolutely buzzing with activity and achievements were popping left and right as people went out of their comfort zone and tried content they hadn\'t done before in order to earn Conquest points. Guild PvP was more active than it had been in months and there was plenty of banter. Point gains aside, it was a joy to see.</p><p>We could see that the Czechs were active in the evening and trying to bolster their score with some planetary rampaging, but we actually had a similar number of people online and were absolutely on fire. By the end of the evening, the gap between us was down to less than ten million.</p><p>I expected Monday to be more quiet, so I was both pleasantly surprised and had a good laugh when I decided to do a quick check-in on Monday morning and saw seven people online in guild. Clearly our members were less constrained by work than I\'d expected.</p><p>We continued Sunday\'s trend at a slightly slower pace and the gap between us and first place continued to shrink all day. By the time the last person went to bed we were only about a million points behind.</p><p>Tuesday I was working from home and I had put a bit of time aside around the end of Conquest to pop my Personal Conquest Requisitions as needed. I had transferred four characters to Darth Malgus the day before (my first character transfers ever) and now held 182 tokens in my inventory and cargo hold. Several other people were online and trying to earn some last-minute points while buzzing with excitement.

All that said, it ultimately turned out... alright, I guess.</p><p>I would still put it near the bottom of <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/05/ranking-first-7-galactic-seasons.html">my ranking of all Galactic Seasons so far</a>, for having a theme I didn\'t really care for, not having any rewards that particularly excited me (there was quite a lot of stuff that was "nice", but I\'ve said before that I consider it a downside when there isn\'t a big central reward that also supports the theme), and for feeling more repetitive than any season before it (I still can\'t quite believe they made me kill all the DvL bosses again for a third achievement).&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time though, things were not as bad as I had feared. Once they made the fixes to make doing your weekly uprising via the group finder more viable, the system worked well enough to funnel people into that to guarantee regular pops even on the smaller servers. (I could even get it done on Shae Vizla, where I hadn\'t done anything through the group finder in a long time.) With <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/04/pugging-trench-runner.html">Trench Runner being the one notable exception</a>, the tuning was such that even a group of low-level or generally underperforming characters could muddle through without too much effort.</p><p>I saw more than one comment, whether explicit or implied, that indicated that the person making it was actually doing uprisings for the first time, which is something that\'s always nice to see. And while my overall opinion of uprisings hasn\'t changed (still not a fan), I\'ll admit that I liked them more as levelling content than as max-level content, if that makes sense. The XP was pretty good every time I went in there on a levelling character, and somehow mowing down hordes of weak mobs feels more "on-brand" on a low-level character. It\'s what you do on the starter planets after all, when you\'re just learning how to play and might not necessarily have that many abilities yet. As endgame content I\'ve always found that kind of gameplay a bit unsatisfying though.</p><p>The other thing I did like about this season was how the devs incorporated the dynamic encounters on Hoth and Tatooine into the weekly seasons objectives. I think they\'re a fun new kind of gameplay and I appreciated their addition to this. Especially on the other servers, where I hadn\'t had any reason to do dynamic encounters before, so I enjoyed gathering a bunch of achievements all over again.</p><p>There are a few things I hope they tweak in coming seasons though: First off, there were two variants of each dynamic encounter objective as far as I could tell, one that required you to do 15 for the weekly, and one that required 25. I thought the first was reasonable, while the second was too much. I still did both types this time around because I also had the draw of wanting to work on the achievements to keep me motivated, but when that\'s no longer applicable I don\'t think I would bother with doing 25 again; it\'s just too time-consuming.</p><p>The second "issue" I had was that just having encounters on Hoth and Tatooine made things a bit repetitive. One of my favourite weekly seasons objectives up until now has been the one to do "repeatable or exploration missions" on a number of planets, and I think the dynamic encounter objectives largely replaced those this season.

All that said, it ultimately turned out... alright, I guess.</p><p>I would still put it near the bottom of <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/05/ranking-first-7-galactic-seasons.html">my ranking of all Galactic Seasons so far</a>, for having a theme I didn\'t really care for, not having any rewards that particularly excited me (there was quite a lot of stuff that was "nice", but I\'ve said before that I consider it a downside when there isn\'t a big central reward that also supports the theme), and for feeling more repetitive than any season before it (I still can\'t quite believe they made me kill all the DvL bosses again for a third achievement).&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time though, things were not as bad as I had feared. Once they made the fixes to make doing your weekly uprising via the group finder more viable, the system worked well enough to funnel people into that to guarantee regular pops even on the smaller servers. (I could even get it done on Shae Vizla, where I hadn\'t done anything through the group finder in a long time.) With <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/04/pugging-trench-runner.html">Trench Runner being the one notable exception</a>, the tuning was such that even a group of low-level or generally underperforming characters could muddle through without too much effort.</p><p>I saw more than one comment, whether explicit or implied, that indicated that the person making it was actually doing uprisings for the first time, which is something that\'s always nice to see. And while my overall opinion of uprisings hasn\'t changed (still not a fan), I\'ll admit that I liked them more as levelling content than as max-level content, if that makes sense. The XP was pretty good every time I went in there on a levelling character, and somehow mowing down hordes of weak mobs feels more "on-brand" on a low-level character. It\'s what you do on the starter planets after all, when you\'re just learning how to play and might not necessarily have that many abilities yet. As endgame content I\'ve always found that kind of gameplay a bit unsatisfying though.</p><p>The other thing I did like about this season was how the devs incorporated the dynamic encounters on Hoth and Tatooine into the weekly seasons objectives. I think they\'re a fun new kind of gameplay and I appreciated their addition to this. Especially on the other servers, where I hadn\'t had any reason to do dynamic encounters before, so I enjoyed gathering a bunch of achievements all over again.</p><p>There are a few things I hope they tweak in coming seasons though: First off, there were two variants of each dynamic encounter objective as far as I could tell, one that required you to do 15 for the weekly, and one that required 25. I thought the first was reasonable, while the second was too much. I still did both types this time around because I also had the draw of wanting to work on the achievements to keep me motivated, but when that\'s no longer applicable I don\'t think I would bother with doing 25 again; it\'s just too time-consuming.</p><p>The second "issue" I had was that just having encounters on Hoth and Tatooine made things a bit repetitive. One of my favourite weekly seasons objectives up until now has been the one to do "repeatable or exploration missions" on a number of planets, and I think the dynamic encounter objectives largely replaced those this season. (I did a count, and in the same number of weeks, Season 7 had 17 objectives of this type, while Season 8 had only 7.) This makes sense in so far as they fill a similar niche and the DEs were the new hotness, but it also meant that what previously made this objective so much fun to do - that it was so varied in its locations and could be done in a number of different ways - was kind of lost as we were just stuck on either Tatooine or Hoth week after week.</p><p>We\'ll see how they\'ll handle this in future seasons, but I think my personal preference would be if they simply merged the two types of objectives together, into something like "Complete Dynamic Encounters, Repeatable, Exploration, or Bonus Missions while defeating enemies on Coruscant or Dromund Kaas", therefore restoring the "rotating between different planets" aspect while also including dynamic encounters in the mix.</p><p>Still, I\'ve got to admit I\'m going to try and temper my expectations for whenever they announce Galactic Season 9, because I\'m definitely a bit bored of the repetition and lack of even small bits of newness at this point.

I took some lowbies to the starter planets to check them out as I would\'ve felt a bit weird razing all those level 5 mobs on a max-level character in raid gear, though other people clearly had no such reservations. The new events brought a lot of existing players back to the starter worlds to check out the the new content and earn some new achievements, and the experience felt like absolute mayhem.

It\'s not that I was against companion rewards in principle, but I did feel that the way they were implemented was becoming a bit stale at this point, so focusing on something else for a change was fine by me.</p><p>I <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/10/galactic-season-5-story-review.html">loved the little storyline that came with the season</a>, even if it was entirely KOTOR style with no voice acting - I enjoyed its mix of intrigue and humour, and the choices were meaningful enough that it was fun to replay it on multiple characters to see different outcomes. I also appreciated that for the reputation tied to the season, they added a major quality of life feature by making it so that reputation tokens could be acquired by any of your alts on the fleet instead of needing to unlock the seasonal companion on each character first.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxhF5iKziFw92O8xYRH_atWRHxXDeaI-TCQMnGAeEbjNMVAPASvi29uBiDDRMxw6POUrGY39AH5lPpaq7ShDuXm57FN0l5kcENAW7K7NHXF-u06wVly0RpZsZNFNY8PJF20GFRNWevgias2Xted47cqRV4-5nOH9lP7MXaNq6UHC8GxVaFDmnsGseBm5E/s1057/Shintar%20with%20Loth%20kittens.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A smiling Shintar kneels between two Loth-cat kittens on the fleet" border="0" height="216" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxhF5iKziFw92O8xYRH_atWRHxXDeaI-TCQMnGAeEbjNMVAPASvi29uBiDDRMxw6POUrGY39AH5lPpaq7ShDuXm57FN0l5kcENAW7K7NHXF-u06wVly0RpZsZNFNY8PJF20GFRNWevgias2Xted47cqRV4-5nOH9lP7MXaNq6UHC8GxVaFDmnsGseBm5E/w400-h216/Shintar%20with%20Loth%20kittens.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The reward track didn\'t have a major season-defining prize (as cute and iconic as the Loth-cat kitten turned out to be) but was otherwise very solid. I was pleased by the many stronghold decorations, and while I wouldn\'t want to wear any of the armour sets in full, they contained some very nice and versatile pieces that I\'ve gone on to use on several characters since then. My main on Shae Vizla also still rides around on her Armasaur. Overall this season just fully delivered for me in terms of fun, and that\'s all I can really ask for.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 3</b></p><p>Seasons 2-4 were very similar in their format and I feel that they were very close in terms of quality as well. The reason I rate GS3 the highest of the three is that it felt slightly more refined than Season 2, but didn\'t suffer from too much staleness creeping in yet (which was something I felt started happening with Season 4).</p><p>I really liked PH4-LNX as a companion - I thought her dialogues were fun and she had an interesting backstory, which was significantly fleshed out compared to what had been done in Season 2. I also liked the seasonal activity of catching cheating gamblers in cantinas.</p><p>The bright yellow weapons and dyes that were part of the reward track during "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20221020">Luck of the Draw</a>" were a bit garish and didn\'t necessarily match with a lot of things, but yellow is my favourite colour so I still appreciated them. The Security Officer and Pit Boss outfits that you could earn were fantastic looks for non-Force-using characters, and my bounty hunter on the Leviathan server still sports a dyed version of the Pit Boss outfit to this day.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 2</b></p><p>"<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20220215">Shadows of the Underworld</a>" ran from February to July 2022 and made a major splash. It released at the same time as 7.0/Legacy of the Sith, and for those of you who weren\'t around at the time, the expansion was <i>not</i> well received at all. Yet even the loudest complainers could find no flaw with the new Galactic Season, which was a particularly powerful compliment at the time.</p><p>At the end of Season 1 I\'d written up <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2021/07/my-feedback-after-galactic-season-1.html">a list of things that I felt would probably need adjusting going forward</a>, but the devs went above and beyond anything I could\'ve ever thought of and gave the system a major revamp with Season 2, in a rare case of Bioware iterating on something quickly and decisively in a way that was pretty much universally well-received. The changes felt refreshing and smooth and everybody loved them. I remember Swtorista discovering that Fenn Zeil had more than one conversation and being all "OMG, the drama, I\'m so here for it", which made me laugh. Really, the only reason it\'s not closer to the top of the list is that I didn\'t particularly care for the underworld theme or Fenn Zeil as a companion, and I don\'t remember any of the other rewards knocking my socks off either.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 4</b></p><p>&nbsp;"<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20230328">A Passage of Peace</a>" lasted from March to August 2023 and continued to emulate everything that had been good about GS2 and 3. Amity is another companion that I quite liked, though the backstory to justify him being armoured from head to toe and yet another follower who just spouts alien gibberish was particularly convoluted. The armour sets from this season were also very good-looking.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbnP5C8q4mkCWMUF1S6JohrXnAq0ysikkDm1e4PsaJqV3so2mc_U4owIy16GySQ5shT0os2cVEbIAUbYS3WtXQXUhmCChXeNxcLM-xreeLoEs1ZQZksblVmPlp1_qbZkiJeN6sGn708XP3obbusgmWKd2gqOnxTVRkR9UV-Zgd5Q8WLkwB_swKKakOZhk/s1920/Amity%20advising%20Zilek%20about%20Lord%20Umbral.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Amity talking to a male Jedi: &quot;I have never felt such turmoil in naother.

I can see my ranking of this one being somewhat controversial, because I think depending on what you care about in the game, you might have had a very different experience with it.</p><p>The Copero stronghold is gorgeous and made for a fantastic reward, plus I thought the stronghold theme in general worked really well (I really enjoyed visiting multiple different public strongholds for the seasons objective every week). And if that\'s the primary thing you took away from the season, I can easily see this one ranking in someone\'s top three, if not in the top spot.</p><p>However for me, the completely linear storyline that ended abruptly and didn\'t seem to go anywhere felt like a major disappointment after the high bar set by Season 5, and the meta achievement to collect vendor trash was initially confusing, then grindy and frustrating. Maybe those things didn\'t really bother you, and that\'s totally fair. But for me it was ultimately a season both of great highs and disappointing lows, with the latter pushing it further down in my personal ranking. <br /></p><p><b>Galactic Season 7 </b><br /></p><p>I was really hesitant about which season deserved last place and went back and forth on the decision a couple of times. I might honestly feel a bit differently about it depending on the day of the week. As it stands, "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/%5Bnews-category%5D/20240820">The Greatest Bounty</a>" was <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/galactic-season-7-in-review.html">decidedly meh</a> in my opinion, but in an inoffensive way. The white Loth-cat kitten was cute, and I think it\'s good that the DvL bosses were brought back to the game, but ultimately the whole bounty hunting theme felt very weak to me and I thought the whole thing was a bit boring.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 1</b></p><p>The other week I saw someone on the forums get all nostalgic for Season 1, to which my immediate reaction was "no way". I can\'t really think too badly of "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20210426-1">The Strange from Kubindi</a>" since it was SWTOR\'s first season ever, the devs were still figuring out how things should work, and we as players didn\'t have any set expectations yet. However, I also can\'t deny that Season 2 was a massive improvement on it in pretty much every conceivable way.</p><p>Season 1\'s heavy focus on daily objectives was quite draining, and I spent way more time running dailies, heroics, or just grinding mobs than I\'d ever consider fun. I appreciated that Altuur had a bit of an intro conversation on Odessen, but otherwise I didn\'t really care about him, and I didn\'t like the season\'s insect theme either.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK954GK2Q7ZNtsNYNc4rIiqLUSP0kT-4eI_R4HMKmabFZW0crKfpO00geW6xoLZL0u6JQD0jtAbUzF1wEGYTMj9BV0h4nlTnJYrlwRSktCrsMdfNHRMZE8MSb-1-8tNJFBK0qVmrjgR76em_QZK_H0zKCG-VCBRwWMl7drEzs3Ybr7jvU5vh-ZTMiIftg/s1920/Altuur%20on%20Balmorra.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Altuur zok Adon on Balmorra" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK954GK2Q7ZNtsNYNc4rIiqLUSP0kT-4eI_R4HMKmabFZW0crKfpO00geW6xoLZL0u6JQD0jtAbUzF1wEGYTMj9BV0h4nlTnJYrlwRSktCrsMdfNHRMZE8MSb-1-8tNJFBK0qVmrjgR76em_QZK_H0zKCG-VCBRwWMl7drEzs3Ybr7jvU5vh-ZTMiIftg/w400-h225/Altuur%20on%20Balmorra.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Like I said, I never felt too bad about it all since it was all new and I didn\'t know what to expect - plus we got the fleet strongholds during this first season, something I\'d almost forgotten about. Nonetheless, I think that every season that\'s come after has been an improvement on the concept.<p></p><p>Even though seasons have "only" been part of SWTOR for four years, it\'s hard to imagine the game without them now, especially considering how many other MMOs include similar systems nowadays.

I also appreciated that for the reputation tied to the season, they added a major quality of life feature by making it so that reputation tokens could be acquired by any of your alts on the fleet instead of needing to unlock the seasonal companion on each character first.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxhF5iKziFw92O8xYRH_atWRHxXDeaI-TCQMnGAeEbjNMVAPASvi29uBiDDRMxw6POUrGY39AH5lPpaq7ShDuXm57FN0l5kcENAW7K7NHXF-u06wVly0RpZsZNFNY8PJF20GFRNWevgias2Xted47cqRV4-5nOH9lP7MXaNq6UHC8GxVaFDmnsGseBm5E/s1057/Shintar%20with%20Loth%20kittens.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A smiling Shintar kneels between two Loth-cat kittens on the fleet" border="0" height="216" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxhF5iKziFw92O8xYRH_atWRHxXDeaI-TCQMnGAeEbjNMVAPASvi29uBiDDRMxw6POUrGY39AH5lPpaq7ShDuXm57FN0l5kcENAW7K7NHXF-u06wVly0RpZsZNFNY8PJF20GFRNWevgias2Xted47cqRV4-5nOH9lP7MXaNq6UHC8GxVaFDmnsGseBm5E/w400-h216/Shintar%20with%20Loth%20kittens.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The reward track didn\'t have a major season-defining prize (as cute and iconic as the Loth-cat kitten turned out to be) but was otherwise very solid. I was pleased by the many stronghold decorations, and while I wouldn\'t want to wear any of the armour sets in full, they contained some very nice and versatile pieces that I\'ve gone on to use on several characters since then. My main on Shae Vizla also still rides around on her Armasaur. Overall this season just fully delivered for me in terms of fun, and that\'s all I can really ask for.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 3</b></p><p>Seasons 2-4 were very similar in their format and I feel that they were very close in terms of quality as well. The reason I rate GS3 the highest of the three is that it felt slightly more refined than Season 2, but didn\'t suffer from too much staleness creeping in yet (which was something I felt started happening with Season 4).</p><p>I really liked PH4-LNX as a companion - I thought her dialogues were fun and she had an interesting backstory, which was significantly fleshed out compared to what had been done in Season 2. I also liked the seasonal activity of catching cheating gamblers in cantinas.</p><p>The bright yellow weapons and dyes that were part of the reward track during "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20221020">Luck of the Draw</a>" were a bit garish and didn\'t necessarily match with a lot of things, but yellow is my favourite colour so I still appreciated them. The Security Officer and Pit Boss outfits that you could earn were fantastic looks for non-Force-using characters, and my bounty hunter on the Leviathan server still sports a dyed version of the Pit Boss outfit to this day.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 2</b></p><p>"<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20220215">Shadows of the Underworld</a>" ran from February to July 2022 and made a major splash. It released at the same time as 7.0/Legacy of the Sith, and for those of you who weren\'t around at the time, the expansion was <i>not</i> well received at all. Yet even the loudest complainers could find no flaw with the new Galactic Season, which was a particularly powerful compliment at the time.</p><p>At the end of Season 1 I\'d written up <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2021/07/my-feedback-after-galactic-season-1.html">a list of things that I felt would probably need adjusting going forward</a>, but the devs went above and beyond anything I could\'ve ever thought of and gave the system a major revamp with Season 2, in a rare case of Bioware iterating on something quickly and decisively in a way that was pretty much universally well-received. The changes felt refreshing and smooth and everybody loved them. I remember Swtorista discovering that Fenn Zeil had more than one conversation and being all "OMG, the drama, I\'m so here for it", which made me laugh. Really, the only reason it\'s not closer to the top of the list is that I didn\'t particularly care for the underworld theme or Fenn Zeil as a companion, and I don\'t remember any of the other rewards knocking my socks off either.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 4</b></p><p>&nbsp;"<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20230328">A Passage of Peace</a>" lasted from March to August 2023 and continued to emulate everything that had been good about GS2 and 3. Amity is another companion that I quite liked, though the backstory to justify him being armoured from head to toe and yet another follower who just spouts alien gibberish was particularly convoluted. The armour sets from this season were also very good-looking.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbnP5C8q4mkCWMUF1S6JohrXnAq0ysikkDm1e4PsaJqV3so2mc_U4owIy16GySQ5shT0os2cVEbIAUbYS3WtXQXUhmCChXeNxcLM-xreeLoEs1ZQZksblVmPlp1_qbZkiJeN6sGn708XP3obbusgmWKd2gqOnxTVRkR9UV-Zgd5Q8WLkwB_swKKakOZhk/s1920/Amity%20advising%20Zilek%20about%20Lord%20Umbral.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Amity talking to a male Jedi: &quot;I have never felt such turmoil in naother.

I can see my ranking of this one being somewhat controversial, because I think depending on what you care about in the game, you might have had a very different experience with it.</p><p>The Copero stronghold is gorgeous and made for a fantastic reward, plus I thought the stronghold theme in general worked really well (I really enjoyed visiting multiple different public strongholds for the seasons objective every week). And if that\'s the primary thing you took away from the season, I can easily see this one ranking in someone\'s top three, if not in the top spot.</p><p>However for me, the completely linear storyline that ended abruptly and didn\'t seem to go anywhere felt like a major disappointment after the high bar set by Season 5, and the meta achievement to collect vendor trash was initially confusing, then grindy and frustrating. Maybe those things didn\'t really bother you, and that\'s totally fair. But for me it was ultimately a season both of great highs and disappointing lows, with the latter pushing it further down in my personal ranking. <br /></p><p><b>Galactic Season 7 </b><br /></p><p>I was really hesitant about which season deserved last place and went back and forth on the decision a couple of times. I might honestly feel a bit differently about it depending on the day of the week. As it stands, "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/%5Bnews-category%5D/20240820">The Greatest Bounty</a>" was <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/galactic-season-7-in-review.html">decidedly meh</a> in my opinion, but in an inoffensive way. The white Loth-cat kitten was cute, and I think it\'s good that the DvL bosses were brought back to the game, but ultimately the whole bounty hunting theme felt very weak to me and I thought the whole thing was a bit boring.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 1</b></p><p>The other week I saw someone on the forums get all nostalgic for Season 1, to which my immediate reaction was "no way". I can\'t really think too badly of "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20210426-1">The Strange from Kubindi</a>" since it was SWTOR\'s first season ever, the devs were still figuring out how things should work, and we as players didn\'t have any set expectations yet. However, I also can\'t deny that Season 2 was a massive improvement on it in pretty much every conceivable way.</p><p>Season 1\'s heavy focus on daily objectives was quite draining, and I spent way more time running dailies, heroics, or just grinding mobs than I\'d ever consider fun. I appreciated that Altuur had a bit of an intro conversation on Odessen, but otherwise I didn\'t really care about him, and I didn\'t like the season\'s insect theme either.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK954GK2Q7ZNtsNYNc4rIiqLUSP0kT-4eI_R4HMKmabFZW0crKfpO00geW6xoLZL0u6JQD0jtAbUzF1wEGYTMj9BV0h4nlTnJYrlwRSktCrsMdfNHRMZE8MSb-1-8tNJFBK0qVmrjgR76em_QZK_H0zKCG-VCBRwWMl7drEzs3Ybr7jvU5vh-ZTMiIftg/s1920/Altuur%20on%20Balmorra.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Altuur zok Adon on Balmorra" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK954GK2Q7ZNtsNYNc4rIiqLUSP0kT-4eI_R4HMKmabFZW0crKfpO00geW6xoLZL0u6JQD0jtAbUzF1wEGYTMj9BV0h4nlTnJYrlwRSktCrsMdfNHRMZE8MSb-1-8tNJFBK0qVmrjgR76em_QZK_H0zKCG-VCBRwWMl7drEzs3Ybr7jvU5vh-ZTMiIftg/w400-h225/Altuur%20on%20Balmorra.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Like I said, I never felt too bad about it all since it was all new and I didn\'t know what to expect - plus we got the fleet strongholds during this first season, something I\'d almost forgotten about. Nonetheless, I think that every season that\'s come after has been an improvement on the concept.<p></p><p>Even though seasons have "only" been part of SWTOR for four years, it\'s hard to imagine the game without them now, especially considering how many other MMOs include similar systems nowadays. I can only hope that the devs can continue to come up with ways of mixing things up and keeping them interesting to do.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/05/ranking-first-7-galactic-seasons.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/05/ranking-first-7-galactic-seasons.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxhF5iKziFw92O8xYRH_atWRHxXDeaI-TCQMnGAeEbjNMVAPASvi29uBiDDRMxw6POUrGY39AH5lPpaq7ShDuXm57FN0l5kcENAW7K7NHXF-u06wVly0RpZsZNFNY8PJF20GFRNWevgias2Xted47cqRV4-5nOH9lP7MXaNq6UHC8GxVaFDmnsGseBm5E/s72-w400-h216-c/Shintar%20with%20Loth%20kittens.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '2'}

For years, your days are built around the rhythm of meetings, deadlines, and the steady flow of people and tasks that fill the calendar. Then one morning that rhythm stops, and what’s left is a lot of open space. At first, it feels like freedom. Soon after, it starts to feel like something else, something harder to name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easy to underestimate how much of who we are becomes wrapped up in what we do. Even in small talk, one of the first questions people ask is, “So, what do you do?” It’s meant to be polite, but it carries weight. You answer with a title, a company, a role, and over time that answer becomes shorthand for your identity. When that part of life suddenly ends, it’s like losing a familiar landmark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first few days after everything changed, I caught myself still checking email out of habit. My brain was wired for a certain kind of busyness. Then came the odd in-between feeling, like floating without direction. There’s uneasiness in not having an easy answer to “what’s next,” especially when so much of our purpose has been tied to structure and responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-82" height="1024" src="https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chatgpt-image-oct-22-2025-10_23_03-am.png?w=683" width="683" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What I’m realizing, though, is that there is purpose to be found in this new kind of work too. My focus now includes helping my wife get our house ready to sell, which is no small task. Every room holds a decade of memories, boxes of forgotten things, and little reminders of how much life has happened here. It’s physical work, but it’s also emotional, sorting through layers of the past while preparing for whatever comes next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, we’re helping two kids navigate big transitions of their own. One is getting ready to graduate from high school and head off to college, the other is wrapping up college and figuring out what’s next for him. Each of them is standing on the edge of a new chapter, full of excitement and uncertainty. Watching them has been grounding in its own way. Their worlds are expanding just as mine feels like it’s shifting, and somehow that feels balanced. We are all, in our own ways, figuring out what comes after the familiar chapter ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In between all of that, I’ve been trying to rediscover the parts of myself that existed before the job title. Writing helps. So does walking, talking with friends, and slowing down long enough to actually think about what matters most. It’s not a straight path, but maybe that’s the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unmooring from work isn’t just about losing a job. It’s about remembering that who we are is much bigger than what we do. The space that opens up afterward can be uncomfortable, but it can also make room for something new to take shape. Right now, I’m learning to live in that space and to trust that it’s leading somewhere worthwhile.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/2025/10/22/unmooring-from-work-identity-after-a-job-loss/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce6ab42cff977c9257c629feb9e6564cb5af44230695b42e3fdeaac8ee32f59?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chatgpt-image-oct-22-2025-10_23_03-am.png?w=683', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I’ve always believed in having a direction, a loose map at least, but lately it feels like the universe has been reminding me that maps are meant to be redrawn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the span of just a few weeks, two big things changed. First, I was laid off from my job at Greif, a company and team that had been a steady part of my daily rhythm for years. Then my son, after months of excitement and planning, decided to change his college commitment from Texas A&amp;M to Arizona State. Different decisions, different impacts, but both sharing a theme: life rarely goes exactly as you think it will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, both events hit me in similar ways, a mix of surprise, disappointment, and the quiet hum of uncertainty. But as I sat with it, I realized that these moments, uncomfortable as they are, carry their own kind of opportunity. Flexibility isn’t just a survival skill; it’s a mindset. It’s about learning to release the illusion of control without giving up the intention to move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing a job forces you to think hard about identity. So much of how we describe ourselves, to others and to ourselves, begins with what we do for a living. When that’s suddenly stripped away, you’re left asking, “Okay, who am I now?” The answer isn’t immediate, but maybe that’s the point. There’s value in the in-between spaces, in the pause before the next thing begins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watching my son make his own pivot has been a different kind of lesson. As parents, we spend years trying to guide, advise, and nudge, and then there comes a point where our job shifts from steering to simply supporting. His decision reminded me that flexibility is just as important in parenting as it is in careers. Sometimes the best thing you can do for someone you love is to trust their instinct to change course, even when it surprises you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s where I am right now, somewhere between endings and beginnings, figuring out what’s next. I don’t have it all mapped out, and maybe that’s okay.

You worked until a certain age, collected a gold watch and a farewell dinner, and then stepped into a quieter life of golf courses, morning walks, and long vacations. Retirement meant stopping. It meant putting down the tools and closing the office door for good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the closer I get to that stage, the more I realize that picture doesn’t fit. Stopping entirely isn’t the goal. In fact, what excites me isn’t the idea of doing nothing, but the freedom to reshape what I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask if I’m thinking about retiring, what they really mean is leaving my demanding corporate role. And yes, I think about it often. But stepping away from one kind of work doesn’t mean I want to stop working altogether. It means shifting the balance, redistributing my energy toward the things that matter most in this season of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, that might look like helping a company in a smaller, more flexible capacity. It might look like writing. It might look like mentoring younger professionals. It might even look like teaching college accounting, something I’ve often thought would be both meaningful and energizing. It will certainly mean being more available for family, especially as my youngest child sets out on his own path. Retirement, as I’ve come to define it, is less about leaving the game and more about choosing a different table.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-75" height="1024" src="https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is freedom in that redefinition. When you stop thinking of retirement as an on-off switch, you open up the possibility of many in-between stages. You can move from full-throttle to part-time, from demanding to flexible, from career-driven to purpose-driven. That spectrum allows for contribution without burnout, for learning without pressure, for presence without constant distraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I notice among friends and peers is that those who thrive after retirement don’t stop being useful. They simply redirect. Some become deeply involved in community work. Others launch second careers in entirely different fields. Some finally give attention to long-neglected passions, whether it’s music, art, or volunteering. The common thread is not absence of work but freedom in the kind of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, redefining retirement requires courage. Our culture still measures worth by productivity and titles. Walking away from the familiar markers of success feels risky, even when you know it’s the right move. But the deeper risk is clinging to an outdated definition of retirement and missing the chance to live a more balanced, meaningful chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t see retirement as the end of usefulness. I see it as the chance to redefine it. To trade in endless urgency for chosen commitments. To replace old demands with new rhythms. To measure value less by output and more by alignment with who you are becoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So no, I am not looking forward to stopping. I am looking forward to reshaping. Retirement, for me, is not a finish line. It is a redesign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And maybe that’s what it has always been meant to be.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/2025/09/22/redefining-retirement/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce6ab42cff977c9257c629feb9e6564cb5af44230695b42e3fdeaac8ee32f59?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2.png?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

But I’ve come to realize that change is just as much about geography. Where we are, and where we’re headed, shapes who we become.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve lived in Ohio for the past twenty years. Its seasons are familiar, its rhythms steady. There’s comfort in the known: the streets you’ve driven for decades, the community that recognizes your face, the office where you can almost walk the halls with your eyes closed. For a long time, I thought of that stability as the backdrop to my story. But lately, I’ve begun to wonder if geography isn’t just the backdrop. It’s part of the script.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-68" height="1024" src="https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Change often starts as a pull toward somewhere else. For me, that somewhere else is Texas. My son will likely be heading to Texas A&amp;M next year, and the prospect of relocating has shifted from hypothetical to something I can feel in my bones. It’s more than a change of scenery. It’s a chance to step into a new rhythm, a new set of habits, even a new version of myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places carry identity. Ohio has given me steadiness, community, and a deep sense of rootedness. Texas, I imagine, will bring openness, expansion, and the possibility of reinvention. Geography can do that. It can pull you into different versions of yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, leaving is never simple. Change means saying goodbye not just to people and places but to the versions of ourselves tied to them. In Ohio, I’ve been the finance leader, the steady hand, the one others count on to navigate complex systems. In Texas, I will not automatically be that. The geography of change strips away old assumptions and asks you to rebuild. That is both unsettling and liberating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve started to think of life as a map with two layers. One layer is the internal map, the values, relationships, and commitments that guide us wherever we are. The other is the external map, the literal geography of cities, communities, and opportunities. When they align, you feel at home. When they don’t, you feel restless.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-66" height="1024" src="https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So much of adulthood is learning to redraw the map. Careers shift. Families grow and scatter. Health and circumstance demand detours. Each move reshapes the landscape, but it also reshapes us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know exactly what Texas will hold, but I do know this: geography matters. And sometimes the surest way to change isn’t to wait for time to work its slow process. It’s to change your place, your view, your horizon line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the geography of change is also the geography of becoming.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/2025/09/17/the-geography-of-change/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce6ab42cff977c9257c629feb9e6564cb5af44230695b42e3fdeaac8ee32f59?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1.png?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.png?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

The chips in front of you may look fine, but the energy, the excitement, and the conviction that kept you in the game have started to fade. That’s often the signal: it’s time to push the chair back, thank the dealer, and step away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been thinking about that a lot lately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most of my career, I’ve been seated at the finance table. The stakes were high, the pace relentless, and for a long time, I thrived on it. Complex deals, leadership responsibilities, deadlines that left no room for error — those were challenges I was proud to take on. But over time, the thrill has shifted. What once felt like the right game has started to feel like the wrong table.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reading the Signals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The signs don’t come with fireworks. They creep in slowly:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>Diminishing returns.</strong> I can still do the work, and do it well, but the energy it takes doesn’t leave much left over.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Competing priorities.</strong> Family calls more loudly than balance sheets. My son will likely be heading off to college in Texas next year, and I want to be present in that transition — not buried under late-night calls and endless travel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identity shift.</strong> I’ve carried titles and responsibilities for decades, but lately I’ve been asking myself a different question: what do I want the next chapter of my life to be about?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These aren’t signs of failure. They’re markers of growth. They’re the reminder that a career is just one kind of table, and that life is bigger than any single game.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Fear of Folding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, leaving isn’t easy. For years, work has been a big part of my identity. Stepping back can feel like walking away from something I’ve built. There’s a voice that whispers, <em>Are you sure?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here’s the paradox: staying too long can be its own kind of loss. In poker, clinging to a hand past its value erodes your winnings. In life, it erodes your energy, your relationships, your health, your chance to explore what else might be possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I’m trying to reframe the choice. It’s not quitting; it’s reallocating. It’s choosing to invest my time, attention, and presence where the returns are higher — whether that’s in family, in writing, in mentoring, or simply being more present for the people I love.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Leaving Well, Beginning Again</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the time comes to leave, leaving well matters. That means preparing others to step in, honoring what the work has given me, and closing the loop with respect. But it also means not rushing to fill the silence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the truth is, there’s always another table. Some tables will look like work. Others might look like learning, creating, or just savoring life in a new place. For me, that may soon mean a fresh start in Texas, surrounded by new rhythms and different stakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision isn’t about whether to leave <em>a</em> table — it’s about whether you’re ready to choose the right one for the season you’re in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is stand up, step back, and trust that the next seat you take will be the one that fits who you’re becoming.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/2025/09/09/when-is-it-time-to-leave-the-table/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce6ab42cff977c9257c629feb9e6564cb5af44230695b42e3fdeaac8ee32f59?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

which he seemed to enjoy and was pretty good at.\u2002It has also limited his ability to do breaststroke going into swim season, but we&#8217;ll see if that eventually comes back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the work front, this was my first full year in my new role, which is more of a business unit finance role instead of my previous corporate controller / treasurer role.\u2002I&#8217;m more of a technical accountant by nature, so I&#8217;m still not the biggest fan of the new position.\u2002It generally requires more travel, which I&#8217;m not able to do because of my wife&#8217;s health issues.\u2002So that has been a challenge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My wife and I finished out the year by taking a short 3-day cruise to the Bahamas.\u2002It was the 5th or 6th cruise we&#8217;ve been on, mostly because my wife&#8217;s parents are big cruise people.\u2002I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;ll ever do one again.\u2002This was the last use of funds for a cruise that we had scheduled with the kids for spring break right when the pandemic started.\u2002We had a generally good time and a fantastic stateroom, but probably not something we&#8217;ll do again.\u2002We had a very disappointing excursion on the second day in Nassau, and that probably soured the experience a little bit.\u2003</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-51" height="1024" src="https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_0827.jpeg?w=768" width="768" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I also got roped into taking over Treasurer duties for my youngest&#8217;s high school water polo and swim teams.\u2002It&#8217;s significantly more work than I was expecting, so I&#8217;ve had to back off of a few other things that I&#8217;m involved in.\u2002I&#8217;ve stopped officiating swimming almost completely and also resigned from the Ohio Swimming Board.\u2002In addition to the high school teams, I&#8217;m also serving as the CFO of my youngest&#8217;s club team, and serving on the board of two local charities &#8211; Recreation Unlimited, which runs camps for children with disabilities, and Star House, a local drop in center for homeless youth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the last big activity during 2023 was continuing to work on my Master&#8217;s degree.\u2002I&#8217;m taking an online Masters of Accounting program through the University of Illinois.\u2002During 2023, I had courses in Management Accounting, Tax and Auditing.\u2002I&#8217;ll be finishing the degree up this spring.\u2002I&#8217;m taking the program because it&#8217;s a credential that I need in order to teach accounting at local universities, something I&#8217;d like to start doing as I approach retirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the year-in-review.\u2002Quite a bit going on.\u2002My hope is to begin posting in this space on various personal musings at least once a week, much like I do with the gaming blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/2024/01/02/2023-year-in-review/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce6ab42cff977c9257c629feb9e6564cb5af44230695b42e3fdeaac8ee32f59?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_0240.png?w=473', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/53262767781_17b3f0de94_o.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_0581.jpg?w=768', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_0827.jpeg?w=768', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I am terrified by what I see as a potential rise of fascism and authoritarianism but especially by the further fracturing of an already divided country.  And I wonder how much of this is the results of external actors trying to force just such a division.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me start by explaining that when you look up white privilege in the Urban Dictionary, there&#8217;s probably a picture of me or some asshole that looks a lot like me.  There&#8217;s a story about my day yesterday that probably sums this up perfectly.  A group is apparently planning to protest my country club today, but I won&#8217;t be able to be there, because I have a Board meeting for the multi-billion dollar public company that I work for.  Yeah, I&#8217;m that kind of dick head.  My country club has members from a variety of minority groups and has always been completely welcoming, but we definitely project the image of a bunch of rich white assholes.  And the reality is that we probably are 85% rich white asshole, but so is the community that I live in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also a pretty liberal guy for a rich white older guy.  Enough so that other members of the senior leadership team at my large public company sometimes feel uncomfortable around me.  They don&#8217;t necessarily like what Trump says or some of the things he does, but they think the things he has done for business are awesome.  I believe in racial justice, in economic equality.  I believe there should be free healthcare for everyone, free college and free day care / preschool.  And I&#8217;d love to be out there supporting the folks that are voicing their outrage and demanding justice, but I also feel like they&#8217;re going to take one look at me and tell me to go home, sit my privileged ass down, shut the fuck up and maybe do some reading or some donating to help their causes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of what I&#8217;m also struggling with is I&#8217;m also questioning the credibility of everything I see.  Everyone has an agenda and that agenda is often being manipulated by algorithms and outside actors that I barely even understanding, influencing what I see on social media and in the news.  I feel like the days where there were a few fairly objective sources of news that you could really trust are long behind us.  Maybe I was just naive then, but I really felt like Walter Cronkite wasn&#8217;t feeding me a line of bullshit.  Even for a self-professed liberal such as myself, I&#8217;ll acknowledge that both the NY Times and the Washington Post are often bringing a slanted perspective and agenda to things.  I feel like NPR remains fairly objective, but I also am confident that my conservative friends would tell me I&#8217;m nuts.  So I struggle with even understanding how much of what I see is true or twisted and taken out of context, by either side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with all that as context, right now I am terrified by what is going on here and in other places around the world.  And that terror is almost immobilizing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in no particular order, here are a few of my thoughts right now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>There is no question that we have a lot of police forces in this country right now where systemic racism is a severe problem.  I&#8217;m not saying that all cops are bad or even necessarily that most of them are bad.  The images from places like Flint clearly show there are good folks out there in blue.  But there are serious problems with police in a huge number of our major metropolitan areas that have needed to be addressed for decades.  We need to stop militarizing our police forces and begin holding them accountable to the same standard we would anyone else when people die or are injured at their hands.</li><li>We need real leadership in the country right now.  I frankly don&#8217;t give a shit if that leadership is Republican or Democrat.  We just need someone that can provide guidance and leadership in a crisis and work to unite, not to divide.  I&#8217;ve said this before on my Twitter feed, but I strongly believe that you could draw five names out of a hat at random and have those five people lead the country for four years, and they&#8217;d do a better job than many of our Presidents of the last century.</li><li>I&#8217;m going to talk in a future post about tribalism and polarization, or at least refer everyone to a really good book that Ezra Klein wrote recently on this topic, but part of the issue that keeps us from being able to reach solutions is the tribalism and us versus them mentality that divides our political system right now.  Neither of our political parties are about ideology right now.  It&#8217;s about making sure the other guy loses and continues to lose at all costs.  That&#8217;s clearly not working and we need to figure out how to undo that in order to move forward.  When the parties were less polarized in the past, it had more to do with racism than it being &#8220;the good old days&#8221;.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>My country feels broken to me right now.  I hear cries for freedom that feel synonymous with an embrace of ignorance.  And it&#8217;s really only freedom for white people, because when people of color come forward with the same cry, we respond with tear gas and rubber bullets.  The part that people are only starting to figure out, is it&#8217;s really just about freedom for rich white people.  For the person working multiple jobs and still struggling to make ends meet, I&#8217;m not sure how much freedom that really is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> So here is what this privileged white dick head is going to do for now.  I&#8217;ve ordered a bunch of copies of a couple of good books that I&#8217;ve seen recommended.  One is &#8220;Me and White Supremacy:  Combat Racism, Change the World, and Become a Good Ancestor&#8221; by Layla Saad.  Another is &#8220;How to Be an Antiracist&#8221; by Ibram Kendi.  I&#8217;m reading one of each and donating the rest to my local library.  I&#8217;m also donating to some organizations supporting Black Lives Matter.  I&#8217;ve always been a card carrying member of the ACLU, and I&#8217;ll be increasing my donations there and also adding donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, the Black Visions Collective and Campaign Zero.  People smarter than me that I respect on these topics have recommended these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More to come on these pages.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://musingsoverpintsandcoffee.wordpress.com/2020/06/03/thoughts-from-a-privileged-white-asshole/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce6ab42cff977c9257c629feb9e6564cb5af44230695b42e3fdeaac8ee32f59?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

The story is told in flashback, with a framing story of an interrogation of protagonist Amelia to explain the events that transpired.</p>\n<p>Those events have Amelia heading home after studies in a self-driving car after having a call with her boyfriend about a new D&amp;D campaign he is writing; perhaps the ending will be enough to get Amelia\'s online best friend Iris to visit. The night takes a turn for the worse for Amelia, as the car takes her far from Paris, to her childhood home of Haven, a castle on the Brittany coast.</p>\n<p>And there, Iris assures her (via a swiftly disappeared phone), Amelia will play a game. Guaranteed she will not get hurt, and she can leave anytime she likes, but she probably should just play.</p>\n<p>The <em>plot</em>\xa0deals with Amelia finding out some uncomfortable truths about her family and their long history. The <em>mechanism</em>\xa0is through tactical RPG battles. The <em>conceit</em>\xa0is that all the enemies she faces act according to strict rules from which they do not deviate. The <em>twist</em>\xa0is that you don\'t know what those rules are until you defeat an enemy type at least once. (A little bit of scribble on a whiteboard spoils the first enemy\'s).</p>\n<p>The demo consists of, as far as I can tell, two regular battles, a boss battle, and two challenge battles. You can rest, but doing so resets all battles (aside from boss battles) and locks all unlocked doors. You\'ll likely need to rest to replenish a resource called <em>plasma</em>\xa0which protects you in battles &#8212; the battle instantly ends when you take enough plasma damage. You\'ll need that plasma, not only to protect yourself, but to 3D print your fighters. The first couple are free; more costs plasma. (It is possible to earn more maximum plasma as you continue through the game).</p>\n<p>You get the template for your first fighter for free (rogue-type). You meet the second one (archer-type) in a robot bar (yes). You meet the <em>third</em>\xa0one (tank-type) in a cell, but I don\'t believe it is possible to recruit him in the demo. He wants you to kill a specific boss, but the one boss in the demo was not that one.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to this one.</p>\n<p>I should have put this post on the other blog. Oh well.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://westkarana.blog/2025/10/19/finished-dissimilar-demo/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2', 'post-id': '83'}

You can see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type">a full list of markers available from base HTML on MDN</a>, and there are more than you might think, but you can also just put in your own unicode character. Bear in mind not all characters are available on all fonts. The clamp on the <code>padding-inline</code> causes the padding to reduce on smaller screens to make it more compact.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/* lists and nested

margin on the <code>.toc</code> div are what allows it to be about half the size of the body (~326px) on wider screens but take up the whole width of the body on smaller screens. It also reduces the padding on smaller screens to make it more compact, even moreso than in the default list style. You can use <a href="https://clampgenerator.com/tools/layout-spacing-size/">a clamp calculator</a> to adjust these properties. My font sizes also reduce based on screen size with a clamp using <a href="https://fluid.style/type">this other calculator</a>.</p>\n<p>To prevent the browser fallback stylesheet from adding unwanted padding and margins I have used many instances of <code>unset</code>. It doesn\'t look like much, but it took me a really long time to figure out where my lists were getting random padding and margins from.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span

It is based off of my ToC HTML design and may break in fun an unusual ways if you decide to do anything differently, but it works!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I\'ve been hunting for a better method to generate complex table of contents from a markdown file since I did <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-09-16-continental-op-slang/">the Continental Op slang post</a>. For the ToC in that post I wrote all those headings and links out by hand and it was not great.</p>\n<p>I use <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a> to write in and I\'m not looking to change writing software. I like it. It does what I want, nothing more or less. However, if you want to insert a ToC it does so by inserting a <code>[TOC]</code> block which is only generated into an actual list when you export the file using pandoc to something else. And the resulting TOC HTML as generated by the default styles is really not great. I could write a new style to apply, but that is a lot of work for just one element.</p>\n<p>So for <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20-bearblog-css-infobox-v1/">the long Infobox post</a> with complicated headings I tried a couple online generators. I\'m not a huge fan of using them because I don\'t really need or want my text to be captured by some random stranger, but it\'s better than the alternative. And the text itself <em>is</em> going online on the open internet eventually.</p>\n<p>The first one I tried didn\'t handle the special characters in the headings properly. The second one I tried worked. It\'s <a href="https://github.com/derlin/bitdowntoc">BitDownToc by derlin</a>. You can download the tool and run it locally, but also, ugh. I\'ll think about it. If I can get it to work it will save some steps.</p>\n<p>For now, here\'s the process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Drop Markdown text into the converter.</li>\n<li>Copy out the resulting plain Markdown list ToC.</li>\n<li>Paste into a draft post in Bearblog.</li>\n<li>Save Draft. Open Preview.</li>\n<li>Open View Source and find the ToC and copy it out.</li>\n<li>Paste it into the Markdown file and find-and-replace add in my styling classes. Wrap it in a div.</li>\n<li>Copy and paste result back into Bearblog editor. Save Draft.</li>\n<li>Double-check Preview.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The only thing I changed from the Default settings is set the character used for the list to just <code>-</code>. If I want a numbered list replacing the resulting <code>ul</code> with <code>ol</code> is faster.</p>\n<p>It\'s not great, but it\'s faster than hand-writing all those links, believe it or not.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20-generating-a-toc">Generating a ToC</a> last edited: 1\xa0day, 14\xa0hours ago</div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20-bearblog-css-infobox-v1" title="Bearblog CSS: Infobox - Version 1">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-22-bearblog-css-table-of-contents" title="Bearblog CSS: Table of Contents">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': "I've been hunting for a way to generate complex table of contents from markdown files for a while.", 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20-generating-a-toc/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': "I've been hunting for a way to generate complex table of contents from markdown files for a while."}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'bearblog', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-20T20:35:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=20, tm_hour=20, tm_min=35, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=293, tm_isdst=0)}

I don\'t want to have to copy and paste or write all that every time I want to put one in a post. However, as I would learn later, if I had just done it with nested divs I wouldn\'t have run into about five thousand problems. (This is foreshadowing).</p>\n<p>I spent a lot of time agonizing over the value of using a svg icon vs just a unicode character, and the value of using a background image in a div vs using <code>:before</code>. In terms of accessibility they\'re both basically invisible to a screen reader so something else has to be done to announce that the text is meaningful in some way. Maybe we can find some way to do it that semantically makes sense and doesn\'t require an <code>aria-label</code>?</p>\n<p>They can be made with a <code>blockquote</code>, that\'s a ready-made box for putting text in. But semantically misleading.</p>\n<p>I found an example that used <code>aside</code> that seemed like a good idea. But then I read up on that and it doesn\'t quite fit semantically either. This isn\'t something "tangentially related" (although I do that plenty too) it\'s an interruption or break in the text. So when I actually clicked through from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/aside">MDN</a> to the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-aside-element">HTML spec</a> I had to pause. How are <em>they</em> doing their little callout boxes for notes?</p>\n<p>Well. It\'s just a <code>p</code> .</p>\n<p>😐</p>\n<p>I\'m not sure I really like that to be honest. (I should have listened to this feeling.)</p>\n<p>But you can\'t argue with the literal HTML spec.</p>\n<p>And I tried it and it worked fine. (At first.)</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;infobox info&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Hello, world!

People seem to have a lot of different opinions on the best way to flag content in the middle of other content. I have yet to find anything by an actual screenreader / keyboard-only user saying what they prefer, though, that is really what I would like to find and am still hunting for amid the absolutely disgusting amount of "beginner web development" slop.</p>\n<p>What I <em>imagine</em> would be ideal is to have some sort of role akin to a heading or a <code>hr</code> that would flag this as a stopping point and not just another paragraph. Because, obviously, they may wish to stop to read the warnings before reading the rest of the content.</p>\n<p>However, there are no ARIA roles that make sense for something like this. The only option is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/region_role">the generic "region" role</a> with an appropriate aria-label to describe what the region is.</p>\n<p>Inserting a heading to provide a natural stopping point and built-in aria label is the easiest option. The reason why I resisted it is because it complicates the heading hierarchy. A <code>H3</code> should always follow a <code>H2</code> and precede an <code>H4</code>. So what header I use in the box depends on where in the document it is placed. This is going to be annoying. Is the sin of breaking the header hierarchy better or worse than just leaving it alone?</p>\n<p>This is what lead me to using <code>strong</code> which <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/strong">MDN actually explicitly says</a> can be used for indicating "notes or warnings within the text of a page". Huzzah! There was a simple solution all along. Unfortunately this small victory just lead me further down the path to destruction…</p>\n<h2 id="the-consequences-of-making-a-paragraph-a-flexbox">The Consequences of Making a Paragraph a Flexbox</h2><p>I gave the paragraph <code>display: flex;</code> so that it would be easier to align relative to the stuff outside it and the stuff inside it.</p>\n<p>However, I eventually discovered that if you make a paragraph a flexbox every item wrapped in tags within it becomes it\'s own flex child. That includes html tags like bold, italic, emphasis, and strong and even strings of text separated by a <code>br</code> are separate children. I\'m guessing this happens because they\'re all <code>span</code> underneath it all.</p>\n<p>At first this was fine and good. I already wanted to use  <code>strong</code> to put text like "spoiler" next to the icon on the left and it being a child item means it naturally floats to the left centred the same as the <code>:before</code> content. I could have stopped there and said you just can\'t use any other tags inside these special paragraph boxes without it looking weird and called it a day.</p>\n<p>But of course I did not call it a day.</p>\n<h2 id="display-is-pretty-complicated-actually">Display is Pretty Complicated Actually</h2><p>I did a lot of reading of the documentation on MDN about flexbox, grid, and then the display property itself. As it turns out, <code>display:</code> is technically two values: <code>display-inside</code> and <code>display-outside</code>. Outside refers to how the block is interacting with the elements around it and inside sets how the <em>contents</em> of the block will be laid out. This was less important back in the day when we were just changing things to be either block or inline but becomes more relevant with grid and flex.</p>\n<p>If you set something to be <code>display: flex</code> you are actually setting <code>display: block flex</code> such that the outside of the box is now a block and the inside is flex and the first-order children are on the outside a block and the inside a flex. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/multi-keyword_syntax_of_display">The page on MDN that explains all this</a> actually uses <code>em</code> within a <code>span</code> as an example of how this works. But still doesn\'t quite resolve my issue.</p>\n<p>How do I make <em>some</em> child items of a flexbox forget they are a block and sit inline nicely as they are supposed to?</p>\n<p>Obviously the first thing I tried was to set it as <code>display: inline</code> but it did not respect that even with an <code>!important</code>.</p>\n<p>I tried the strange and half-supported <code>display: contents</code> which briefly gave me hope. It functionally does what I want to do, which is remove the "boxiness" of an element. However the consequences of using it are that the actual contents of the tag disappear from the html. They\'re rendered, but if you use inspect the html the text is literally not there, as is the case when you set a <code>content:</code> property in CSS.</p>\n<p>You can test this out on this page by using developer tools, select some random element, and then add the <code>display: contents;</code> property to it. Then look at the HTML pane and see how the tags are now "empty". So, in short, this is not a good solution.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I think it is literally impossible to make the first order child of a flexbox stop being a block.</p>\n<h3 id="fun-with-selectors">Fun with Selectors</h3><p>I am going to summarize a lot of time spent fighting with <code>:first-child-of-type</code> and say: yes it is possible to select only the first <code>strong</code> and style it to be centred to the left by the icon, but because it is <em>not</em> possible to make all the rest of the tags in the box behave normally inline it is a moot point.</p>\n<h2 id="last-ditch-attempt-to-use-paragraph">Last Ditch Attempt to Use Paragraph</h2><p>Giving up on making the paragraph a flexbox entirely, can we align the things inside the box such that it looks like it did with the flex?</p>\n<p>In short, not really. We can use padding and relative positioning and all the usual old fashioned stuff to make the icon and text roughly vertically centred within the box and use a hanging indent to push any wrapping text away from the symbol at the beginning, but it is very finnicky and doesn\'t look great to my eyes. I gave up on it pretty quick. But it can be done.</p>\n<h3 id="flex-less-css">Flex-less CSS</h3><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">infobox</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">border-radius</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">padding</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0.65</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">text-indent</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">hanging</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c">/* the key addition */</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n\n<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">info</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">background</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">--color-info</span><span class="p">);</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n\n<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">info</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nd">before</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">content</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">\'\\2042\'</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">--size-title</span><span class="p">);</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">padding-right</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0.65</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">300</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n\n<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">warn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">border</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">solid</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">rgba</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">229</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">77</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">46</span><span class="p">);</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">background</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">rgba</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">229</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">77</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">46</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0.4</span><span class="p">);</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n\n<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">warn</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nd">before</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">content</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s1">\'\\26A0  CW:\'</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">--size-h2</span><span class="p">);</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">padding-right</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0.65</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">600</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n<h2 id="hindsight-is-2020">Hindsight is 20/20</h2><p>With the benefit of hindsight, all this probably makes sense within the way that flexbox is intended to be used. Second-order children of a flexbox <em>aren\'t</em> flex, and that non-intuitive break in the inheritance makes more sense when you go through all the shit I did. The problem I\'m running into with this is because a <code>p</code> is basically a <code>div</code> with various <code>span</code>s within it. Normally, you would almost always put a chunk of text within a div into a <code>p</code> tag, meaning the <code>strong</code> type formatting tags become second order children and therefore sit inline the way they\'re supposed to.</p>\n<p>If you\'re making a static box with text like a button or a modal window you can just put the text into the div without a paragraph wrapper and make sure all the words are in the correct place with <code>position:</code> , which automagically breaks the flex curse. However if you want to be able to change the text inside the box the way I do you can\'t be positioning individual words with css. I mean maybe you can but it\'s beyond me.</p>\n<h2 id="the-final-paragraph-version">The Final Paragraph Version</h2><p>So here is the final result of using a paragraph as a div. If you choose to use this HTML/CSS combo you will just have to remember not to put any other tags within the box. If all you want to do is e.g. make one "spoilers" box and put some fixed text into it and copy paste that into your posts this will work fine. If you want to be able to change the text in the box depending on the situation you will have to wait for the second edition of this infobox after I gave up on using the paragraph as a wrapper.</p>\n<p>I wanted a general info callout type thing and a more attention-grabbing box for content warnings and spoiler warnings. So there\'s two classes per box, but you could add as many classes as you want different types of box, e.g. a "spoiler" box, a "NSFW" box, an "important note" box, etc.</p>\n<p>Also if you want multiple lines you need to put a <code>br</code> in because, obviously, the text is inside a paragraph already.</p>\n<h3 id="about-unicode-symbols">About Unicode Symbols</h3><p>I originally tried using the <a href="https://symbl.cc/en/1F6C8/">unicode symbol for information (i in a circle)</a> for my information box, however as it turns out Android\'s default fonts (Roboto) simply do not actually include a big chunk of unicode. Mind-boggling oversight by the world\'s most widely adopted mobile OS. Apparently most of the third-party Android OSs patch in more unicode, but not the Pixel. This particular "information" symbol was added in 2014 so they\'ve certainly had time to do it. Once again, what is the point of having a standard if nobody adheres to the standard. The <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter web font</a> I\'m using also does not include that symbol so it just displays as a blank rectangle on Android, regardless of browser. So I had to use something else. Something to consider if you are wanting to change the symbol I used – make sure that the glyph is included in one of your web fonts. If you really want to ensure the icon looks the same everywhere <a href="https://thecommabandit.bearblog.dev/cohost-infoboxes/">follow what thecommabandit did</a> and link to or <a href="https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/how-to-add-svgs-with-css-background-image/">embed a svg</a>.</p>\n<h3 id="about-colours">About Colours</h3><p>I couldn\'t really decide on colours and I had to do different colours for light and dark mode so I made quite a few variations. I\'ve put together four options. These colours are all taken from the <a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/scales">Radix colour scales</a>, but somewhat arbitrarily. I also learned about doing <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp">transparency with rgba colours</a> so one of these uses that. I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp">a colour converter</a> to go from hex to rgb values.</p>\n<p>I\'ve used codepen this time like one of the cool kids so you can actually see all the options in action.</p>\n<h3 id="0-basic-html-and-css">0.

But this post is already 3000 words so I\'m splitting off the actual solution and that will go up later. I don\'t like to say this was a complete failure because I did learn a lot in the process, and the final product of the "using p as a box" experiment <em>does</em> work as long as you respect the caveats. But it didn\'t actually do what I wanted it to do, so it\'s not a full success either. A smarter person perhaps would have given up much earlier and just used the obvious method of nested divs instead of spending hours trying to solve a problem that is unsolvable because they were so invested in the idea of using <code>p</code> as a box. Knowing when to quit is important.</p>\n<p>If you do end up using these boxes for something give me an upvote or send me an email so I can feel better about myself lol 🥲 And if you\'re thinking "Wow, obviously that would never work, why would you even try to do that" you can keep it to yourself.</p>\n<p>The journey continues...</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20-bearblog-css-infobox-v1">Bearblog CSS: Infobox - Version 1</a> last edited: 3\xa0days, 11\xa0hours ago</div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-19-oct-week-3-digest" title="Oct Week 3 Digest">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20-generating-a-toc" title="Generating a ToC">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'A very long journey into HTML and CSS in a failed attempt to make a box with an icon and some text in it.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20-bearblog-css-infobox-v1/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'A very long journey into HTML and CSS in a failed attempt to make a box with an icon and some text in it.'}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'bearblog', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-20T20:30:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=20, tm_hour=20, tm_min=30, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=293, tm_isdst=0)}

It has been taken down from my preferred read online site so I had to scramble to make sure it was on my private anime/manga tracker. I don\'t think it\'s worth raving about, but it\'s fun for the first 10-ish volumes, especially Nao\'s evolution as a player, and then sort of runs out of steam. The author doesn\'t seem particularly strong at writing meaningful character arcs and it\'s impossible to make the ultimate bad guys interesting or satisfying.</p>\n<p>I do think it has some of the best games of all the death game manga I recommended, in terms of being a simple concept that becomes more complicated the more you think about it, but as a result the readers often have to spend a lot of time keeping track of numbers and rules. There are quite a few games invented by this author like 17 card poker I would love to try IRL. I\'m not saying I\'d be good at it, but it would be interesting.</p>\n<p>I don\'t really like reading manga on my phone, it\'s too small to see the details and zooming in and scrolling is annoying. This is probably why longstrip Korean webtoons have over-taken manga in general popularity. But having my laptop in bed with me to read on it is bad for the sleeping habits. It\'s too tempting to do other stuff. I\'ve never been tempted to own a tablet or e-reader but I guess this is the use case. I wonder if any charity organization near here has some e-waste crap one laying around I could have for free or near-free.</p>\n<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><h3 id="the-celebrity-traitors-s01e03-04">The Celebrity Traitors S01E03-04</h3><p>I am really enjoying this a lot. The producers clearly understand that what we the audience want to see is national treasure level celebrities get dirty and covered in water and stinky bird feathers. There have been some amazing individual moments as well. A++ on that. The puzzles have been pretty good, much better than Series 3 but probably still need to get a bit harder as the days go on because right now the ones who are actually good at missions are being hindered by the people who are not. I guess it depends on who gets taken out.</p>\n<p>The Faithful have honestly been doing better than the regular show\'s players, who usually waste the first 6 of 12 episodes coming up with ridiculous theories based on nothing, but the Celebs have the advantage of actually knowing each other\'s personalities before going in. They also know how producers think – hence the "big dog" theory. Someone even made the point of "just because someone\'s name came up and we didn\'t eliminate them doesn\'t mean they\'re automatically not a Traitor" which is something I and probably many people have been screaming at the TV (esp. Series 1).</p>\n<p>But also the producers know that the game isn\'t fun unless the Traitors have a legit chance to win, so the Faithful can never be allowed to eliminate them all until about the last two episodes. If this was a death game it wouldn\'t just be about figuring out who the traitors are, but also <em>keeping</em> certain people Traitors that you think will take other Faithful out and keep you in. If you eliminate a Traitor early you\'re actually shooting yourself in the foot because then they will recruit someone, and that new Traitor will be in a very strong position having already "proved" they are a Faithful.</p>\n<p>I can\'t believe I\'m trying to pirate podcast extras, but since the BBC geofenced the BBC Sounds app you need a UK IP address to access any content on it.

I wish they would at least stop taunting me by mentioning the extras at the end of every regular Uncloaked episode.</p>\n<p>I would love to find someone to talk about this show with but I don\'t want to venture onto the mainstream social medias 😓  I want to talk about fear of power and dictatorships and unconscious bias and cognitive dissonance.

They\'ll be a big malware target, but it also always have been. Taking sensible security measures will still probably work to protect most people most of the time.\nb) The majority of e-waste is going to come from small/underfunded institutions who legally can\'t be running an unpatched OS and can\'t afford to pay the subscription fee for security updates (and migrating to Linux would be a years-long project even if you could convince them to do it).\nc) this is a perfect example of how "consumer demand" isn\'t actually the primary driver of production.

Because while higher level items do tend to drop better materials, it\'s the difference between your stat and the enemy/node\'s stat that seems to influence drop rates a lot more. If I\'m level 70 and do a level 30 ore I get way more drops than if I\'m level 70 and do the exact same ore at level 70.</p>\n<p>Its the same for Ginormosia. You need to hit Rank 5 for certain enemies to start spawning, but it seems like after that nothing new appears. Maybe that will change with the upcoming DLC. But it means that keeping the areas at rank 5 or 6 is optimal if what you want is to actually farm drops. If you want more EXP maybe higher level enemies are better for that, but honestly my levelling only started slowing down at 70, the EXP curve seems to steepen after that. But if you\'re careful and well equipped you can still beat enemies that are at 80 as a level 60-70. You burn through a lot of healing items and food and need to be careful about SP consumption, but it\'s very doable. The real problem is not getting drops from those high level enemies because my level is similar or lower.</p>\n<p>For the record, my best combat team is usually me as Magician doing offense, Sloane doing heals, Glenn who has a buff against crown enemies, and either Odin, who has high aggro and defence, or Laura if the enemy is Dark element because her Light move does big numbers.</p>\n<p>Going back to the treasure grove, I\'ve figured out the strategy a bit better. It\'s a lot kinder than most randomized dungeons in games I\'ve played. You can swap team at each floor, you can move through floors you\'ve already cleared automatically, and you can leave whenever you want with no penalty. And the dungeon layout stays the same so you don\'t even have to start again at the beginning. Honestly it\'s even easier than the actual dungeons in this game because you can just open the menu and leave whenever instead of having to run all the way out.</p>\n<p>The only disadvantage is if you find a good room you can\'t just farm it – but the internet says that if you don\'t actually complete the mission for the floor and quit the dungeon it doesn\'t get greyed out and you can just go back in. I haven\'t tested it yet though and I\'ve already read wrong information about this game online before. Like that dark energy and slates only drop from shadow enemies once you hit floor 500. Nope! I just finished floors 200-300 and got plenty.</p>\n<p>So now that I\'ve finished getting all the Ginormosia areas up to Rank 5 or higher I\'ve just been spending a bit of time there toggling the towers back and forth to see if I can get a legendary to spawn and farming so I can restock the veggie stands and make acorns. Which I can then spend on the ultra-rare materials and recipes from the travelling merchants.</p>\n<p>I am going to continue pushing down into the Treasure Grove until I hit something too difficult to get past, but it is really tempting to just keep replanting at floor 300. I\'m getting great stuff every time I go in there. It\'s a grab bag but it feels like a better use of time than killing 5000 bees and collecting 5000 pine logs that I don\'t need.</p>\n<p>I\'ve also collected enough Slates now to get a ton of new recipes I don\'t have the materials to make and unlocked two of the Dark Magic gates. One just had some chests behind it with one recipe, but the second had a recipe and a Luminous Dark Tree which is very good for materials. Unfortunately only one though, and not close enough to the door to actually be an easy thing to farm. Sigh. Treasure Groves really are the way to go.</p>\n<p>When I was digging around lately I found two good resources via reddit:</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasylife/comments/1l0eyd6/ginormosia_area_rank_map_monsters_resources_16/">A hand-drawn map of Ginormosia with the key Rank 5 Gathering spawns</a> by Skyeacreon (Reddit)</p>\n<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qhzobmkJ9U2wv5iFIl6u6xfgzxBspkUALkxTuclykqk/edit?usp=sharing">A spreadsheet of the monsters in each zone and a checklist for the ones required for rank up</a> by ???

And I came across some upscaled versions of old MacOS wallpapers. And got a bit nostalgic.</p>\n<p>Definitely the last OS update I\'ve ever been genuinely excited for was Mavericks. That introduced native Dark Mode. There were a few helpful features after that, and the change to storage type was probably necessary, but that was really the perfect OS for me. It had everything I needed. I stopped updating my 2015 MacBook Pro at Mavericks because I really wasn\'t confident newer OS versions would be ok on the older hardware. It was already struggling with basic stuff. And I had a lot of software that had stopped supporting OS versions that old, but I didn\'t want to upgrade to newer versions because I would have to start paying a subscription fee instead of the one-time payment I had made however many years before.</p>\n<p>I definitely feel like moving to Windows 11 was a step backwards in a lot of ways. There are a lot of features and programs I just took for granted on MacOS that Windows still doesn\'t have. Even though I have stripped out all of the ad and AI bullshit and telemetry and shit, I do genuinely feel like Win11 is a worse OS than a version of MacOS from 10 years ago. It\'s just actively unpleasant to use.</p>\n<p>But I did spend a huge amount of time perfecting my Mac setup too. I told myself I\'d just have to spend that much time again getting Windows to work the way I want it to. But after a year of using it I still feel like Windows is constantly fighting me.</p>\n<p>The thing is, in my experience since switching off of MacOS and having to switch to mostly FOSS software for financial reasons the experience is still, generally, worse. I don\'t want to hear that I\'m just more familiar with MacOS and that\'s why I like it more. I started out on Win 95 and used Win XP up until university, I taught myself Command Prompt commands to deal with my shit-ass school-mandated Dell laptop and the million ways in which it would break. Then I switched to OSX for undergrad and it did, genuinely Just Work. I customized the hell out of it, but it wasn\'t because the built-in default software didn\'t work or because the settings were ass, it\'s because that\'s just the type of person I am.</p>\n<p>I used OSX/MacOS from 2007 to 2023. My first was a black plastic MacBook that just barely got me through my honours thesis – the hard drive was failing and the OS would get too corrupted and start repeatedly kernel panicking about once a month so I had my school files all backed up online and a full disk image on an external hard drive so whenever it failed I would reboot from the image, reinstall the OS, and then keep chugging away until it failed again. When I got to graduation I convinced my parents to buy me a new MacBook Pro for my masters. That lasted another four years before I bought a 2015 MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>I couldn\'t justify replacing it with another MacBook at the price they\'re at while I\'m unemployed. They\'ve always had a brand tax, but before I felt it was worth it. They had very good quality control and designs and you didn\'t have to compare a million different models at a million different prices. Now, the gap between them and the comparable budget to medium quality laptop is higher and the benefits seem less. MacOS has been iOS-ified and locked down. I learned how to program on MacOS and now they don\'t even want people to be able to install unsigned software.</p>\n<p>So I bought a Windows PC with the full intention of installing Linux. I did a lot of research and I tried dual booting PopOS, got it installed, and then somehow in the process of trying to figure out how to add GNOME extensions (the most unintuitive process I have ever seen) and get Bluetooth to work it crashed and it was unrecoverable even with Rescuezilla. I probably messed something up in my fiddling around with keyboard layouts trying to get it to use the Windows key in the same way Mac keyboards use the ⌘ key. Using CTRL+ as a modifier key is very un-ergonomic with small hands. I have to hold it with my left pinky finger.</p>\n<p>Anyway, had to wipe the whole thing. Didn\'t have the energy or motivation to try again at the time. Reinstalled Win11. I know that it might only take half an hour to an hour to get the actual OS installed, but the process after that of making it actually usable? Will my duplicati file backups even be read okay by a different file system? And then troubleshooting everything that breaks? Spending hours reading <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth_headset">that fucking Arch Linux wiki trying to diagnose what part of the 40000 ways Bluetooth can break</a> just so I can use my headphones?? (No disrespect to the Arch Linux wiki it\'s incredibly detailed.)  Yeah, I\'ll try again when I have the patience.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you hate Windows and you can\'t afford Mac you\'ve only got Linux, right? But the thing is. As I have experienced over the past year of having this laptop and trying to self host things on my NAS. FOSS often feels like a step down. Like, it\'s hard to find a piece of properly maintained open source software that is the same or better than comparative corporate / proprietary options in terms of functionality, reliability, and ease of use. They might be better in terms of security or privacy or ethics, and learning more about how computers actually work may be good for people overall, but you have to show people the real trade-off they\'re making.</p>\n<p>I genuinely think it\'s irresponsible to recommend Linux / de-googling / FOSS to normies as if it\'s going to be a 1-to-1 replacement and then throw up your hands when they complain and say it\'s just open source you can\'t expect too much. If you\'re prepared to actually provide hand-holding one-on-one tech support for someone as you transition them to another OS / software, which they have to use every day and rely on for life-critical things, then I salute you. Godspeed.</p>\n<p>So anyway. <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/default-mac-wallpapers-in-5k/">Here are the MacOS default wallpapers upscaled to high res</a> at 512pixels. I picked MacOS Monterey\'s dark mode for now, but downloaded a few. If I had found this earlier I maybe would have just colour sampled it and use it as my blog theme colours.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 1\xa0week ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-16-fast-beginner-instant-pot-recipes" title="Fast Beginner Instant Pot Recipes">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-17-fantasy-life-i-150-hrs-update" title="Fantasy Life i - 150 hrs update">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Some nostalgia for old MacOS versions triggered by looking at default wallpapers and a short rant about FOSS.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-17-i-miss-osx/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Some nostalgia for old MacOS versions triggered by looking at default wallpapers and a short rant about FOSS.'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'journal', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'tech', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-17T16:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=17, tm_hour=16, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=4, tm_yday=290, tm_isdst=0)}

I buy and portion and freeze them so they\'re always ready. There are a lot of frozen veg that will cook for about the same amount of time as frozen chicken thighs so you can also just keep that in the freezer. <a href="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/instant-pot-chicken-thighs/">Here\'s the times I use for chicken.</a></p>\n<p>Stewing beef (off-cuts) is also good for the instant pot, but you need to brown it before cooking it to lock in the juices and be sure all the pieces are the same size so they cook evenly. Over-cooked beef really isn\'t great so you have to get the timing right.</p>\n<p>Calrose, arboro or other shortgrain rice can be cooked separately (6 mins high + 10 mins natural release) and put in the fridge and then cook the chicken thighs when you want them to put over top.</p>\n<p>Season before putting things into the pot.</p>\n<p>And my hot tip is you can fry bacon in the bottom of the pot and then take the bacon out. Anything you cook with the leftover bacon fat at the bottom of the pot will be extra tasty.</p>\n<p>My go-to recipes are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-07-15-chicken-rice-soup/">Chicken rice soup with veg</a> - very much dump it all in and go</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.happyfoodstube.com/instant-pot-chicken-risotto/">Chicken mushroom risotto</a> - requires a bit of sauteing to start but super warm and filling. I have bastardized this to remove the mushroom and onion and added in other veg.</li>\n<li>Chicken cacciotore (kind of) - chicken thighs in tomato puree. Generous italian seasoning (basil, oregano, black pepper, thyme, parsley) on the chicken thighs. Tomato puree in the pot with some water, whatever frozen veg you have (I usually do spinach cubes, but other firm veg like carrot or peas are usually also ok), bit of soy sauce and cooking wine, grate or chop some parmasean or grana padano in. Put the chicken thighs in on top, they don\'t need to be covered by the sauce. Same cooking time as linked above. Serve over rice.</li>\n<li><a href="https://funwithoutfodmaps.com/low-fodmap-beef-stew/">Beef stew</a> - great in cold weather but with the price of beef these days I don\'t do it much</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can see you can basically do chicken thighs + some sort of sauce or soup stock + rice + veg in any combination. Softer veg like raw tomatoes might go mushy or wilt but sometimes that\'s fine. All of these take 60 mins or less for me, but probably more like 90 when I was just learning and still modifying the recipe.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 1\xa0week ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-13-fantasy-life-i-140-hrs-update" title="Fantasy Life i - 140 hrs update">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-17-i-miss-osx" title="I Miss OSX">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Some short instant pot tips and a few starter recipes.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-16-fast-beginner-instant-pot-recipes/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Some short instant pot tips and a few starter recipes.'}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'cooking', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'instant pot', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'recipes', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-16T18:50:15.851632+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=16, tm_hour=18, tm_min=50, tm_sec=15, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=289, tm_isdst=0)}

I\'m quite overlevelled of course. The story of the game overall was a bit underwhelming, but I liked the references to the original game and it wasn\'t bad per se. The best parts of the game are taken from the first game in general, but I can\'t deny it has kept my attention for this long.</p>\n<p>I don\'t know if I\'ll bother getting the two combat jobs that I haven\'t levelled at all up to Hero. It means a lot of grinding of mooks. I prefer just playing the jobs I can do on muscle memory. But now I have most of the Ginormosia areas up to rank 5 I have access to a lot more rare enemies and materials without having to go back down into the dungeons, which are so annoying to get in and out of. Today I finally saw a gold crown sheep enemy that drops a type of fleece that I need for my hero crafting.  So I\'m getting there. While I grind I\'m making an effort to get as many comrades up to full hearts as possible, it doesn\'t seem completely impossible.</p>\n<p>Based on what I read about the post-game content I\'m going to need to kill a lot of shadow enemies to get drops from them and there\'s two main ways to do that: the fortress or the treasure groves. The fortress means guaranteed spawns, the treasure grove means getting more other stuff at the same time. I have a necklace with item drop+ on it, but I need to try to make some more other stuff with that skill on it as well to make best use of my time. I might need some more of those remake cube currency things.</p>\n<p>I also know that I need to get the shadow energy balls dropping from shadow enemies to unlock the gates throughout the game. It\'s going to be annoying going back through every dungeon to find them all. I wish this game had a "repel spray" item or the dragon quest mechanic of weak enemies running away from you. Even if you can totally ignore them and they don\'t do any damage hitting you it\'s still annoying.</p>\n<p>I hadn\'t even touched the treasure groves before finishing the story, so I\'ve only made it down to floor 200 now (each floor goes by 10 so it\'s not as much as it sounds). I thought I probably would have to grind all the way down until I got to the level 50 layer to find anything good, but I\'ve already had ultra-rare materials spawn at level 20-30. Maybe it\'s because I\'m already level 70-ish in all my combat/gathering lives? But I\'m very happy to finally see some Magic Ore. I still haven\'t even seen any in Ginormosia.</p>\n<p>It\'s annoying that the Encyclopaedia in-game isn\'t super comprehensive. It mostly only shows you the first place you can find something. It still might be available elsewhere. And all the wikis/walkthroughs these days are bloated and ugly, even with quite strict ad-blocking you have to spend ages to find out one fact. The title of the page will be like "Location of Magic Ore" and then you have to scroll multiple times to find the single line of text that tells you where it is. The rest is just junk. And then you have to check somewhere else to confirm and they disagree. Argh.</p>\n<p>So when I play now my tasks are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy more shadow carrot seeds.</li>\n<li>Plant seeds and water.</li>\n<li>Go to Ginormosia and finish levelling areas to rank 5.</li>\n<li>Check for good legendary spawns and do those.</li>\n<li>Clear the first floor of the fortress for shadow enemies.</li>\n<li>Go back and check on the seeds to water them again.</li>\n<li>Do a treasure grove run.</li>\n<li>Turn in the shadow slate things for recipes.</li>\n<li>Restock veggies at stands and find merchants to spend acorns on rare materials and new recipes.</li>\n<li>Collect Celestia flowers.</li>\n<li>Check on the gallery (because it affects the island rank up).</li>\n<li>See what new things I can craft now that I have a few more new materials – I especially want to get at least one more legendary tool going.</li>\n<li>Talk to the Plundering Jaguar for upgrades to the legendary equipment.</li>\n<li>Craft some more food and potions.</li>\n<li>Harvest vegetables.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I guess I\'ll keep playing as long as I\'ve still got TV to watch while playing it. I\'m sure my brain will just turn off it suddenly at some point, as it does.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 1\xa0week, 3\xa0days ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-13-bearblog-theme-css-v10" title="Bearblog Theme CSS v10">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-16-fast-beginner-instant-pot-recipes" title="Fast Beginner Instant Pot Recipes">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Beat the game story, still grinding up Ginormosia, killing shadow enemies, and venturing into Treasure Groves.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-13-fantasy-life-i-140-hrs-update/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Beat the game story, still grinding up Ginormosia, killing shadow enemies, and venturing into Treasure Groves.'}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'fantasy life i', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'video games', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-13T20:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=13, tm_hour=20, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=286, tm_isdst=0)}

I didn\'t 100% adhere to it, but it was good for having a guide so I didn\'t spend all day trying every possible combination. So for e.g. violet-1 and 2 are for backgrounds and violet 11 and 12 are for text.</p>\n<p>I also didn\'t actually use the scale itself in the css, I copied and pasted the values into my own naming scheme, which I may end up regretting.

I\'m just going to leave them as is for now.</p>\n<p>I\'m not entirely satisfied with how it turned out, it\'s a bit <em>too</em> monochrome now, but I feel better having a solid base to work off of. It would be nice to have multiple "button" colours depending on the actual button\'s purpose and I\'m not entirely happy with the link styling either. But we\'ll see.</p>\n<h2 id="font-sizes">Font Sizes</h2><p>I\'ve been using clamp-based responsive font sizes <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-08-25-bearblog-theme-css-update/#font-sizes">for a while</a>, but the smaller font sizes are a bit too small on mobile. So I adjusted those. They\'re still pretty close to what they were nobody will probably notice the difference much. Just me, the person who spends the most time staring at the site.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">\t</span><span class="nt">--size-xsmall</span><span

id="mark-and-code">Mark and Code</h2><p>Added styling for <code>mark</code> and <code>code</code> html elements. I haven\'t actually used mark to highlight anything yet but I might want to? And code is for small bits of code in-line with text of course.</p>\n<h2 id="suffering-with-accordions">Suffering With Accordions</h2><p>I\'ve tried out the <code>details</code> tag and it seems good for truncating long text in the middle or end of a post. Most of the other css-only code snippets I found for the purposes of collapsing long text were more focused on full-on accordion menus or truncating long text into a modal window type thing. I don\'t want to have to make a whole elaborate thing that I\'ll have to copy and paste into a post every time I want to use it. So I thought for the purposes of posts like this where I\'m going to include a long block of text I\'m going to stick with <code>details</code> until it becomes a problem.</p>\n<p>The HTML looks like:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">details</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">summary</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Text that goes on the button<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">summary</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\nThe text you want to hide<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">details</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n<p>You can style it differently depending on if its open or closed and you can change the little arrow marker like it was a list marker.</p>\n<p>But then of course when I actually tried it to collapse a long piece of code the Markdown fenced code block doesn\'t render. So I tried to make the same kind of code block that markdown renders by hand in just html and now I don\'t have syntax highlighting any more. Because there aren\'t the bazillion little <code>span</code>s to target. 😩 So yeah I guess it\'s one or the other unless I figure out something else.</p>\n<h2 id="full-theme-code">Full Theme

I\'m not doing anything special for it, other than watch the Blue Jays. Canadian Thanksgiving doesn\'t have quite the same colonialist trappings as the US version, even when I was a kid it was just a harvest festival that had nothing to do with the subjugation of indigenous people. I don\'t know if they teach more indigeneity around the holiday in schools now. It was my favourite holiday as a teenager because unlike all the other official school holidays or my birthday it didn\'t have any negative memories associated with it and I got to eat good food made by my relatives. The fact that my parents can\'t cook beyond boiling things or heating things up in the microwave is well known in my extended family. Just being able to have homemade food, including apple pie for dessert, made the forced socializing worthwhile. Unfortunately I cannot see the point of cooking for one and apples now extremely reliably give me IBS cramps. 😭</p>\n<div class="toc">\n<h2 class="toc-head">Contents:</h2>\n<ol class="toc-list"><li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#reading">Reading</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#watching">Watching</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#listening">Listening</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#playing">Playing</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#living">Living</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#bookmarking">Bookmarking</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><h3 id="emmurder-at-the-black-cat-cafeem-by-seishi-yokomizo"><em>Murder at the Black Cat Café</em> by Seishi Yokomizo</h3><p>I did finally read it the night before it was due back at the library. 😅 It was disappointingly short because even though it is a slim book to begin with it\'s actually two totally separate novellas rather than one, and the second one isn\'t listed anywhere on the front or back cover. It\'s a nice cover design, but confusing choice by the publisher. The second story is "Why the Well Wheel Creaked" and actually is much more emotionally moving and scary than the main one. But they both hinge on the mystery trope of a dual identity.</p>\n<p>There is something calming or satisfying about Yokomizo\'s stories, they\'re always perfectly complete puzzles. There might be lots of red herrings, false alibis, and multiple suspects, but at the end when you find out the solution from Kindaichi you don\'t feel tricked but rather that it was perfectly put together. The first story feels like it could have been drawn out to at least small novel length; if you read it right through as I did you won\'t have time to really try to come up with a solution by yourself unless you\'re very disciplined and stop midway on purpose. Unfortunately, one black cat does die. :(</p>\n<p>The second story is on a theme that Yokomizo has touched on before with Gokumon Island: soldiers returning changed from the war. The history of a rural noble family is told and their conflicts with other local families and you can see with the set-up what is probably going to happen, but the way the story unravels in epistolic form with a signature Yokomizo twist is still tragic and horrifying. No Kindaichi in this one either.</p>\n<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><h3 id="the-celebrity-traitors">The Celebrity Traitors</h3><p>As mentioned last week, <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-11-the-traitors-death-game-manga/">I did end up making a rec list of death game manga</a> that have a somewhat similar set-up to The Traitors or are focused on trust/lying and psychological manipulation.</p>\n<p>The first episode of Celeb Traitors was incredibly enjoyable and a fun variation on the original. It wouldn\'t replace the original because part of the appeal of the original is that it\'s just normal everyday people participating and these are all people who have public personas and know how to act for a camera. But Alan Carr turning into a puddle of anxiety is very, very funny to watch.</p>\n<p>Deeply irritated to find out that you can\'t access the tie-in podcast outside a UK IP address. let-me-in dot gif. It\'s hosted by Ed Gamble, of course, because I\'m only already listening to two other podcasts by him.</p>\n<h3 id="sportsball">Sportsball</h3><p>Blue Jays vs Mariners is a 7 game series which feels like it\'s going to take forever, even if they only take breaks during travel days. Baseball games are <em>so long</em>. The first game starts Sunday at 8pm. I always start watching a half hour or hour late so I can use the catch-up feature to skip the ads and boring bits, but I still haven\'t quite learned what parts of the game are safe to skip.</p>\n<p>Hackey has started. The Leafs will be playing the same afternoon as the Jays game at the ACC, so that area of the waterfront is going to be an absolute nightmare of people tomorrow. Not that I was planning on going down there. Raptors basketball doesn\'t start until the 22nd, I\'ll have to find a google calendar of their schedule to plug into mine.</p>\n<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2><p><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-04-oct-week-1-digest/#listening">Same as last week.</a></p>\n<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2><h3 id="jigsaw-puzzle">Jigsaw Puzzle</h3><p>I\'ve been working steadily at it and it\'s almost halfway done now, but I\'m slowing down again as I hit a vague white/beige/yellow/pink area in the middle. I might start working from the top down now, the areas with more saturated colours are easier to find the pieces for. Running out of room on the board to actually put the loose pieces.</p>\n<p>I haven\'t seen any new puzzles at the charity shop, alas. I might have to try the nearest Value Village, but they\'ll definitely be more expensive.</p>\n<h3 id="fantasy-life-i">Fantasy Life i</h3><p>Ran credits on Fri night after beating the final bosses handily.  I\'m quite over-levelled. Didn\'t cry, surprisingly, but it was a nice ending. I also did my first Treasure Grove to get a feel for it. I\'ve done some reading and it seems I will have to do some serious grinding if I want to get access to the recipes and materials needed to rank my crafters up to Hero. But what else am I going to do during these 4 hour long baseball games??</p>\n<h2 id="living">Living</h2><p>Despite feeling somewhat better mood-wise after last week, I\'m still having an absolutely awful time trying to sleep. I don\'t know if it\'s residual background stress or what. As a result I\'m also finding it hard to motivate myself to get things off the to do list because I\'m just tired and headachey all day. I haven\'t even really been working on CSS, although I still have a few things on my list to fix/change. I need to get back to cleaning and working on job applications.</p>\n<h2 id="bookmarking">Bookmarking</h2><p><a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/guide">Defetive by Design\'s Guide to DRM-Free Living</a></p>\n<p>This is an old link, DBD has been around for a long time, but I saw a mastodon post about someone asking where to find DRM-free ebooks and this list came to mind.</p>\n<p><a href="https://robertbirming.com/bear-blog-plugins/">Bear Blog Plugins</a> by Robert Birming</p>\n<p>A javascript pagination plug-in and a link to a github repository with a few other plug-ins.</p>\n<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2019/12/why-details-is-not-an-accordion/">Why </details> is Not an Accordion</a> by Dave Rupert</p>\n<p>When I was looking up methods of making an accordion with just html/css I ran across this blog post that summarizes some social media discussion/warring blog posts about using the html details tag to make accordions. There are a lot of functional and accessibility issues with trying to do that, as it turns out.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/scales">Radix Colors - Scales</a></p>\n<p>I already included this in my <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-07-bearblog-custom-colours/">colours link blog post</a>, but I think it\'s what I\'m going to use for the blog once I get around to inputting all the hex codes and then find and replacing a bunch of stuff. Specifically the Mauve-Grey and Violet swatches. I really appreciate all the information in this guide on how to use the colour swatches as well, it makes things quite straight forward and eliminates the need to do contrast checking and tweaking by myself.</p>\n<p><a href="https://discourse.32bit.cafe/t/resources-list-for-the-personal-web/49">32 Bit Cafe Resources List</a></p>\n<p>Has a nice long list of links for everything from accessibility to webrings.</p>\n<p><a href="https://blog.avas.space/influencers/">a frank piece about influencers</a> by ava</p>\n<p>I don\'t spend enough time in the spaces that influencers occupy to know any of them, but that is intentional. The whole thing feels quite skeevy and I hate having other people\'s perfect clean homes and perfect faces and immaculately decorated desks constantly shoved in my face. I had always assumed most of them were lying/faking their prosperity, but Ava goes into some of the specific tricks influencers use to make themselves look good in a way that is functionally impossible to replicate.</p>\n<p>I know people talk about the decline of literacy in the American (and Canadian) youth all the time, I don\'t really buy into it, but I especially think that they are probably much more video literate and savvy about this stuff than people like me. People have always lied on the internet, but people my age and older have also always been trained to see photo/video as the truest "proof" of authenticity there is. I wonder if there have been any studies on skepticism and literacy of video across age categories. But even if you\'re aware it\'s mostly a lie it still really fucks with your self-esteem to see it all the time.</p>\n<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20121218-00/?p=5803">Why was pinball removed from Windows Vista?</a> by Raymond Chen</p>\n<p>By the guy who actually did the code porting of 32 to 64 bit Windows.

It&#8217;s a bit of an interesting spin on the genre, too, being set in &#8216;Depression era&#8217; New York, but where magic of various forms has taken the place of certain aspects of technology developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m torn on having Goodreads count it as a single book though. It&#8217;s >1,800 pages for the five books, which is not out of the question but certainly on the longer end of my typical books, but each individual book is shorter than my typical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still- I think I&#8217;ll hit my 15 book target easily enough even counting it as just the one, so eh! :)</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-september-2025/">Time to Loot Journal: September 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com">Time to Loot</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-september-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2', 'post-id': '65691'}

I&#8217;m convinced the first cave-teenager to suffer a break-up took to banging rocks together in a rhythmically satisfying way, rather than talking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could absolutely have been that cave-teenager. Finding music that resonates with the soul, or at least the big feelings of the moment, is cathartic in a way almost nothing else can be. Even if it does take a bit of mental gymnastics to make every line fit your situation sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a>. You may&#8217;ve heard of it &#8212; but if not, it&#8217;s an AI that can create songs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d heard of it before. But honestly? I had simply assumed it&#8217;d be little more than a toy. Somewhere along the line I got the idea you had to provide your own vocals, and the AI just acted like a souped-up auto-tune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>can</em> use it like that, sure. But you can also simply write your own lyrics and have it go at it. Heck &#8212; if you&#8217;d rather, you don&#8217;t even need to do that. Just describe what you want, like any other LLM, and it&#8217;ll spit out your response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only this time it comes with a soundtrack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://suno.com/s/YfVE4FBgRpdZWnZF"><em>Shadows and Neon</em></a> is one such created in this way. I could not have expended any less effort on it if I <em>tried</em>. I can&#8217;t even recall what my prompt was, but I know I didn&#8217;t even bother prompting for specific styles. I just wasn&#8217;t invested yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it made me sit up and pay attention because I couldn&#8217;t hand on heart tell you I&#8217;d definitely have identified it as AI-generated if I hadn&#8217;t just clicked the &#8216;Create&#8217; button myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thus Starts my Crash Course in Song Construction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I <em>like</em> music, I couldn&#8217;t have told you a few days ago what a &#8216;prechorus&#8217; was (beyond the obvious), or what precisely a &#8216;bridge&#8217; is meant to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of this learning was just feeding in basic prompts and seeing what came out, but I also took a bit of a stab at seeing if I knew enough to take inspiration from other, much better, songs and seeing if Suno could get me anywhere close. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was even reading song and album reviews for crying out loud. It was a bit like learning a new language adjacent to, but not quite the same as the one you&#8217;re native to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/jJSVX5qAs2KcYbK6">What Never Relents</a></em> is one such attempt, where I was looking to see if I could craft a style prompt to hit a similar feel to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUe9UhcUtEI">Specter by Bad Omens</a></em>. It does tickle me that the generated lyrics here used &#8216;Specter&#8217; without specifically being prompted to or given the lyric directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not an unqualified success (particularly not on the vocal stylings), I was, once again, somewhat impressed. And I hadn&#8217;t even realised that you could enfold section-specific direction to vocals and music in the lyrics as well yet!<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-1-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-65184" title="I mean, it will ignore you completely 9 times out of 10, but still, you can!"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Toy to Therapist</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point, a switch flicked. Don’t ask me how or why &#8212; I couldn’t tell you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I do know is that I realised I’d still been treating Suno as a toy, when it was clearly more than that. So… I did something I haven’t done in <em>many</em> years.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-2-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65184" title="Probably not since I was that rock-bashing cave-teen myself."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote something like poetry — only this time, I had a way to give it a soundtrack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we call those songs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because she’d been on my mind a lot lately, I wrote one about my mother. Let me tell you &#8212; I was <em>not</em> ready to hear the words sung back at me. Jesus H. Christ. I&#8217;m uncertain what context to give. Perhaps none, and leave it to what I&#8217;ve already <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/goodbye-mum/">said in the past</a>. Songs are meant to speak for themselves anyway, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hit me harder than I expected. Harder than I was ready for. And yet, I kept working on it. It took a fair bit of finessing of lyrics and style guides to get where I wanted it &#8212; and Suno really does not like being told what to do if you introduce the concept of a second voice &#8212; but I ultimately found my way to this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/zQ6jTxGIw1ClJRnT">The Weight of Love</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s still a sombre piece overall, the more I tweaked, the more small notes of light started slipping in. Verse 3, for example, wasn’t in the first draft at all &#8212; it only emerged as I kept writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, for starters, I think I finally get why some albums feel like they’re circling one idea over and over. Apparently, when something matters, you don’t just&#8230; wring it out in a single track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So of course I had to do another. I had more work through here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just like that, I think I&#8217;m on the path to just creating a whole (virtual) album. Whodathunk? Certainly not me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not blind to the issues such AI technologies pose, whichever side of the fence you sit on. I can&#8217;t say I know how ethically the models have been trained (but&#8230; I could guess). Nor do I relish a future where the world is drowning in &#8216;AI Slop&#8217; in the music field as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the transition of considering Suno from Toy to Therapist is perhaps telling of my perspective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to spell it out; I don’t think anything I make with it should soar to the top of the charts, or replace the work of genuinely talented artists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as something personal — a way to process, to experiment, to speak feelings I’d struggle to put into words otherwise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s powerful stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first cave-teenager banged rocks together to make sense of big feelings. I guess I’m doing the same, only now the rocks have been swapped for an algorithm and a pair of headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bonus Track</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/hjZv4nd55jkbFif0">Remember Me (That Way)</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second (made, but maybe not in final placement) track from this hypothetical album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honouring Mum&#8217;s request for how she wished to be remembered &#8212; but without burying the truth for those left behind, either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a trickier one to land, asking Suno to balance minor and major sections to hit the right overall tone. Last night I was <em>just about</em> ready to come to the conclusion Suno simply couldn&#8217;t do it. After changing my approach to the in-lyric style notes and the main style guide, here we go!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/">Accidentally, Songs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com">Time to Loot</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'post-id': '65184'}

My interest has increased the further on I&#8217;ve gone though, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was to point out the key reason for enjoying this one less, it would be the tie-in to real-world, actual history.  I shant elaborate further as to what or when, but I will explain a little more my issue with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it isn&#8217;t the subject matter itself, nor the philosophical or ethical lean Lawrence is aiming for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m on board with all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it removed all subtlety from the proceedings. It no longer asked the reader to think through implications and parallels for themselves and instead became a mallet to the face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strength of fiction, done well, is that whole stimulation of thought. Creating (or perhaps more accurately, finding) the links for yourself. I believe it truly holds the power to change hearts and minds in a way that a raw recounting of history cannot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than that though, no-one enjoys being preached at, even when they already agree with the message. While I wouldn&#8217;t quite accuse Lawrence of that here with the third book, it started feeling like it might toe that line to begin with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all that &#8212; I&#8217;m still more than curious to see where the series ends, and it does little to dampen my enthusiasm for Lawrence as an author on the whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

Beyond that though the decision gets a fair bit trickier. Both FFXIV and Wuthering Waves are doing their darndest to be the one. Wuthering Waves had its 2.6 patch this week, with a character banner I was actually interested in<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-3-65003"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/wuthering-waves/screenshot-saturday-wuthering-waves-2-6-edition/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-65003" title="I haven&amp;#8217;t gone for anyone since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D9K2rz3Uvk&quot;&gt;Cartethyia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=optr9r9VkoQ&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;)"><sup>3</sup></a></span> and what looks to be a finale-feeling storyline for the Rinascita story arc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Although it is possible, actually, that this trailer is representing more than just 2.6. Perhaps a 2.7 is in our future to close out Rinascita. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know yet because I haven&#8217;t actually <em>started</em> the 2.6 Main Story Quest yet, let alone finished it. Actually- that&#8217;s not 100% true. I have done the preamble/character introduction bits, but then paused just shy of getting started <em>properly</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead I&#8217;ve caught up on the Overture quest from 2.5, which, come to think of it, is pretty similar in nature to the between-expansion quest lines of FFXIV. Just&#8230; <em>much</em> shorter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; Alright, I&#8217;ve gone on this long. I was going to outline the case for FFXIV before deciding, but perhaps that can just occupy next week&#8217;s slot! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-columns wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65007" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250828220450_2-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Won Augusta 1st night of the patch!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65008" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250830020819_1-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Did <em>not</em> win weapon first night.

The mindblowing nature of this fact is pretty intense. I realise this. I did warn you though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This truth wasn&#8217;t revealed to me in a dream, but rather while I was writing <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/final-fantasy-xiv/the-far-edge-of-fate/">yesterday&#8217;s post</a>. I was on a deadline, albeit a self-imposed one. I had things to do. &#8230; Thing to do. <em>Alright, geez,</em> I had a game to play. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have our own motivations, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonight I don&#8217;t have quite the same need. I made it through the end of Heavensward, hit credits (<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/final-fantasy-xiv/rolling-credits-on-heavensward/">again</a>), and got the Stormblood title drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-64967" height="529" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250827233112_1-940x529.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV:</em></strong> Passing the Wall, into all new lands.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, I lied, I do have the same need. I want to play more. The start of Stormblood is great so far. Plus! I now know who the lady in red in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt1h1MinlLI">Stormblood trailer</a> is! All these years, and I just assumed she was a class trainer from the expansion. Eesh!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. I&#8217;m getting distracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; If focus is the key, I might be in trouble. ! <em>Althooough</em>, I got distracted <em>while</em> writing this time. So I&#8217;m going to call that progress. Surely it&#8217;s better than stopping mid-post to reply in Discord or Google some random thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I think it might be actually, is channelling that&#8230; <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/writing-comments-vs-posts/">comment writing energy</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The linked post goes into more detail, but as a brief recap if you haven&#8217;t the foggiest what I mean&#8230; Something that&#8217;s true for me, and others, and maybe you&#8217;ll recognise it as well after I explain it, is that writing a post&#8230; Man, that&#8217;s <em>work</em>. It takes time. Serious time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments though? Even if they end up being post-length in nature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Easy</em>. They just flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a whole other part of your brain gets engaged. Or&#8230; Perhaps more accurate to say that in &#8216;comment&#8217; writing, a part of your brain <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> get engaged. Namely, the critic. The editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All to say, I found Wilhelm&#8217;s post today both incredibly timely, <em>and</em> incredibly enlightening, <em>and</em> amusing to boot.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>Basically, the secret to my success is low standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8211; Wilhelm Arcturis (2025), <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/08/27/blaugust-motivation-where-do-all-these-words-come-from/">Blaugust Motivation – Where Do All These Words Come&nbsp;From?</a> (The Ancient Gaming Noob)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And I should also add: accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should take the time to read the post yourself, so I don&#8217;t want to give it all away &#8212; but one last part I can&#8217;t help but to voice agreement with. I have the time to blog more. Write more. It is absolutely a choice to prioritise other pursuits (*cough* games) more often than not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps if I consciously leaned into this style more often, I could have my cake and eat it too&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;Thoughts for another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Games await.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Full List of Blaugust 2025 Participants</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/blaugust-2025-is-here/">little while</a> since I posted the list of Blaugust participants.

And if you look at it funny and kinda squint a little bit, you might stretch me to two and a quarter. Maybe even two and a half &#8212; as the missing game I <em>had</em> played before, at its PlayStation release. I just thought I might pick it up again on PC, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong> is, frankly, amazing. The gameplay trailers we saw in the four years of development often seemed as if coming directly from a game designer&#8217;s fever dream. Such doubts didn&#8217;t stop me in the slightest from feeling an unhealthy degree of hype for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-medium is-resized wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-58475" height="264" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blackmyth-Wukong-470x264.jpg" style="width: 400px;" width="470" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I knew what I was doing, and it was certainly at the back of my mind that it could <em>never</em>.

Turns out, there <em>was</em> a reason my friends and I have played through all three Borderlands games to date, sometimes multiple times! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was with that lens some of the gameplay coming out from content creators grabbed my attention a bunch more, and here we are, considering prioritising it against even Hollow Knight: Silksong!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Battlefield 6 &#8212; 11 October</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/other-games/battlefield-6-open-beta/">The beta</a> was enough to convince my friend group that we want in. It was a <em>blast</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been a while since we have all done a Battlefield game together. We had some interest in 2042 (in fact&#8230; it made an appearance in the <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/gaming/coming-games-of-interest-2021-edition/">Games of Coming Interest &#8212; 2021 Edition</a>), but, uh&#8230; That one didn&#8217;t end up being so good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This seems a real return to form, with destruction on par with what my memories tells me Bad Company 2 had. (And no, I&#8217;m not interested in going back and proving myself wrong or removing my nostalgia goggles. It&#8217;s my favourite!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; This is the second game on the list that has some dependence on Borderlands 4; namely &#8212; are we done with it by the time this rolls around?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If not, perhaps it awaits a sale, or at least the Christmas break.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where Winds Meeting &#8212; 15 November</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell you what game <em>isn&#8217;t</em> dependent on Borderlands 4 though &#8212; it&#8217;s this one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has actually been on my radar for at least a couple of years, I think the Arekkz channel first introduced me to it. What I didn&#8217;t appreciate until quite recently is that it isn&#8217;t just a Singleplayer game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is there co-op, but you can even (optionally) go into a full &#8216;Online&#8217; mode where it is more of an MMO-lite, with world events/bosses, and the whole nine yards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh- it&#8217;s also free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which can be boon or bane; but at least how the devs are talking now &#8212; the monetisation seems restricted to cosmetics only. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a slew of sponsored videos like this one, where there is clearly a desire to build interest in the West before the release later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is coming across as a bit of an &#8216;everything to everyone&#8217; game at the moment, which again&#8230; Could be concerning. But the responses so far seem, on the whole, quite positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So bring on my SP/Co-Op/MMO Wuxia Souls-Like Action Combat Life Sim game! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Borderlands 4 and Where Winds Meet are the two definites on this list. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There isn&#8217;t a world in which those two get missed. Although if I had been forced to choose between the two&#8230; I think it would be Borderlands 4 that got the boot, honestly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other two are trickier to call. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I would say that I reckon even should Hollow Knight: Silksong ride the deferral bus for a bit, I&#8217;m much more likely to circle back to it. Battlefield 6 on the other hand, if we let that one slide now&#8230; Eh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe we pick it up on a sale somewhere down the line?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guess we&#8217;ll see when the next one of these comes around!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

I had already gone far enough last time to be into the 3.3 content, and end the major conflict of the expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I returned, I was on the MSQ (Main Story Quest) titled &#8216;Choices&#8217;, which had a bit of &#8216;Anime Beach Day&#8217; energy to it, albeit with far less fan service. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-64854" height="529" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250823225638_1-940x529.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mission was to bring the various city-states together in a Grand Melee, as a sign of breaking Ishgard out of its previously insular footing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was actually fairly impressed that the melee itself had some systems attached. Simple ones, sure &#8212; but more than I expected. The winner is first to 100 points, where any regular soldier is worth just 1 point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, each side will always have one fighter marked by a beam, indicating they are worth 10. You need to take down their big point targets while protecting your own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And</em>, the whole thing culminates in a boss battle which I shan&#8217;t spoil, although I do I have to admit&#8230; *cough* &#8230;it took me a few tries. Because I <em>thought</em> it was a simple DPS race (I was <em>very</em> close to achieving it this way), but I was underestimating the game again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a mechanic there which needed to be respected. Again, not complex, nothing you wouldn&#8217;t have seen before even within FFXIV up until that point.

Cyberpunk 2077, for all its launch faults, is in fine form now. It wasn&#8217;t abandoned or given bare minimum technical touch-ups. Instead, it had literal <em>years</em> of additional development effort put in to make it sing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bring it up in the context of a brilliant post by <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/">Frostilyte</a>, asking the question: &#8220;<a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/18/is-it-wrong-to-support-grounded-2-in-early-access/">Should <em>Grounded 2</em> even be <em>allowed</em> to utilise <em>Early Access</em>?</a>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My title probably spoils this, but: <em><strong>yes</strong></em>. Not only <em>should</em> Grounded 2 be &#8216;allowed,&#8217; I wish more big titles had the guts to wear the Early Access label when it fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyberpunk sure should have. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, gamers were left feeling anything &#8212; or everything &#8212; from frustration to disappointment, or even betrayal. Slap the EA badge on it and suddenly? The consumer transparency preserves a mountain of goodwill and space to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281" height="461" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190826000049_1-830x461.jpg" width="830" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>No Man&#8217;s Sky</em></strong>: Another example where the &#8216;Early Access&#8217; tag really should&#8217;ve been applied.

Although I would hope not a controversial one: <em>If, for whatever reason, you&#8217;re not going to finish the game before putting it out, maybe at least be honest about this fact.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Frostilyte had more than just us consumers in mind. He was interested in watching out for the Indies, and that&#8217;s where the debate perhaps gets a little more complicated. Early Access was, after all, born as an indie lifeline — a way to keep the lights on and build community while development continued. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It provided a path that maybe <em>didn&#8217;t</em> ask Indies to re-mortgage their house in trade for a year of development time in the hopes of not (literally) losing it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when AAA shows up in that space, the worry is whether it tilts the field even further against the smallest studios. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-53598" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CS2Header-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Cities: Skylines 2:</em></strong> Even now, this one should still be wearing an Early Access badge.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And from that concern, there are a couple of additional paths beyond consumer transparency that my mind goes down, but neither of them changes my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>Indies and AAA <em>already</em> co-exist; and Indies aren&#8217;t just catering to a small niche of interest any more.</strong><br />Indies and AAA&#8217;s already co-exist in the market today, having broadened from a once scrappy niche with only occasional breakouts to something with a higher degree of awareness in the gaming zeitgeist. AAA&#8217;s adopting &#8216;Early Access&#8217; doesn&#8217;t materially change things for the worse, and in fact, there is an argument to be made that says such a move would further legitimise &#8216;Early Access&#8217; and broaden the range of people willing to try it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>What even is an &#8216;Indie&#8217; anyway?</strong><br />The term covers a vast spectrum, from the solo dev mortgaging their house we mentioned, to &#8216;indie elites&#8217; like Supergiant, Team Cherry, or Larian, pulling in millions with sizable teams. Depending on how you define it, even CD Projekt Red might qualify as indie, given they self-publish.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-8-64743"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-shouldve-launched-in-early-access/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-64743" title="Albeit with an employee count in the 4-digit range."><sup>8</sup></a></span> The gulf between struggling solos and elite indies is at least as significant as the gap between elite indies and AAA, which makes drawing the exclusion line at AAA feel arbitrary.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-47980" height="264" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20221221014306_1-940x264.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide:</em></strong> Yep, you guessed it.

Although this thing has been in the works so long, it certainly has been placed &#8212; for the purposes of retaining sanity &#8212; in my mind into the category of &#8216;never going to turn up in my natural lifespan&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do think a shadow drop at the end of this is not out of the question, but at minimum, I expect we&#8217;ll come away with a release date to go alongside the additional gameplay teaser.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lords of the Fallen II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve only somewhat recently started playing Lords of the Fallen (2023) after their 2.0 update, when they added in co-op by way of a free &#8216;Friends Pass&#8217;, which is a neat addition I always love to see for any game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re not done with it yet, hard to say if we even will (my co-op partner is not much of a Souls-like afficiando), but the experience while not a top-notch-shining-example of the genre was good enough that I&#8217;m holding some interest in seeing where they go next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Europa Universalis V</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not given the Europa Universalis series anywhere near as much time as Crusader Kings, and in fact &#8212; EUIV is the only one I&#8217;ve touched at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is just something about the more personal relationships and stories of CK that pulls it ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so &#8212; colour me interested. Getting in at the ground floor on a Paradox game is generally a good idea if you want to have any hope of learning the game in question without reliance on extensive &#8216;let&#8217;s play&#8217; styled tutorial videos. xD</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Silent Hill <em>f</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230; <em>think</em>&#8230; I&#8217;m interested? I&#8217;ve actually never played a silent hill game before. The concept has always interested me (insofar as I understand it, at least) &#8212; just never made the jump to actually doing anything about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I watched the movie though, if that counts? xD</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, similar to EUV above &#8212; I&#8217;ll await reviews and see how it lands before deciding, but will keep it on my radar in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enshrouded &#8212; Wake of the Water Update</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick search tells me that the only prior mention of Enshrouded on Time to Loot was the <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-january-2024/">January 2024 Journal</a>. Said mention? Just a sole entry logging ~5 hours of play time, and that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll say now what I didn&#8217;t say then: I <em>loved</em> almost everything about my time with Enshrouded, even at that early point (which must&#8217;ve basically been at release).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was just one disappointing factor for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In multiplayer, the quest state is (was? I should look into this) determined by the world state. And not just for things where maybe it makes sense (e.g., rescuing an NPC) but for <em>everything</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you, as I do, prefer to have independent bases *in addition* to the more communal setup&#8211; so far as the quests are concerned anyway, too bad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is absolutely a nitpick, and even if that is unchanged, the look of this update, let alone whatever may have come up to this point, might be the point at which I let it go and jump back in regardless. It looks <em>great</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resident Evil Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My &#8216;real&#8217; introduction to Resident Evil (*cough* outside of the movies) was with what I believe to be the first of the modern entries &#8212; Resident Evil VII: Biohazard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still need to make my way through the frankly amazing-looking remakes at some point, but they may have to wait a bit longer after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Black Myth: Zhong Kui</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yes</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Myth: Wukong, somewhat amazingly, <em>actually managed to live up to the hype.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhong Kui isn&#8217;t just a DLC as earlier speculation suggested, but rather a full-on sequel. I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb and suggest there probably won&#8217;t be as long of a wait this time around, assuming a lot of technology (and perhaps even asset) re-use from Wukong.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vampire: the Masquerade -Bloodlines 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno about this one anymore. It has been through an incredible amount of development hell and studio handovers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might still come out of the oven OK, but I&#8217;d place the chances of that being <em>very</em> slight. Which is a shame, as this occupied the #1 spot on my Steam wishlist for probably a good few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess I might be listing it here now more out of morbid curiosity than anything else. It&#8217;s coming out October 22, 2025 &#8212; so I guess we&#8217;ll know soon enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

Shortly after entering the City of Tears for the first time, you’re greeted by Hornet. She’s a recurring boss fight character, but this time she’s here with information instead of a challenge. We’re told that we need to seek a Grave of Ash, and then she takes off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The grave in question is a large monument located within the Resting Grounds, and is a required pit stop for players along the main quest of <em>Hollow Knight</em>. Despite this, no additional direction is provided by Hornet, nor is the location of the grave marked on your map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, <em>Hollow Knight’s</em> developer, <em>Team Cherry</em>, provided 4 different access points to the Resting Grounds for players to stumble upon. If you’re curious, the 4 paths are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>A tram from Forgotten Crossroads if the player has found the Tram Pass in Deepnest</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A path through Blue Lake if players have acquired the Crystal Heart</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A (seemingly) bottomless pit which you can accidentally fall down while exploring the Crystal Peaks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>An elevator located on the East side of the City of Tears that allows you to approach the graveyard from below</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Map from Hollow Knight showing the 4 entry points into the Resting Grounds." class="wp-image-9648" height="346" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/resting-grounds-from-hollow-knight_edit.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>By providing 4 different entry points into the Resting Grounds, <em>Team Cherry</em> has dramatically increased the odds for players to find this essential part of the game. As such, they don’t need to explicitly spell out where to go next. Instead, players are free to explore, and stumble into the Resting Grounds of their own accord.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This whole sequence &#8211; a vague hint resulting in the discovery of the Resting Grounds &#8211; was the key to what made <em>Hollow Knight’s</em> exploration tick. <em>Team Cherry</em> trusted that I’d get where I needed to go, so I was able to explore as I deemed fit. That made my whole journey feel like an adventure even though I was doing, and going exactly where the developers intended at every step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t just the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> that encourages this type of organic exploration: the sequel <em>Silksong </em>does too. For example, after clearing the tutorial, we come across a dilapidated settlement called Bone Bottom. Here we’re informed that we’ll need to make a pilgrimage to the holy city, the Citadel, which sits at the apex of Pharloom. From there, we’re left to find our way up the mountain, and discover the entrance to the Citadel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh. My mistake. It appears <em>Silksong </em>has actually marked the location of the Citadel on the map. That’s&#8230;a little disappointing. Though, I suppose that does clearly articulate where the game wants us to go, while also showing how much progress we’ve made towards our destination.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Map of Pharloom from the beginning of Hollow Knight: Silksong." class="wp-image-9651" height="346" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/map-at-beginning-of-game.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>That’s not really an example of organic exploration though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How about after we enter the Citadel, and encounter Lace for the second time. She fulfills a role similar to Hornet from the first game, and informs us that we need to ascend to the top of the Citadel to find, and defeat the God who cursed the entire kingdom of Pharloom.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Map of the Citadel shortly after meeting with Lace." class="wp-image-9653" height="346" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/map-within-citadel.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Oh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again with the quest marker showing exactly where we need to go next. That’s a little frustrating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fairness, Lace did give us fairly explicit instructions for where we ought to go next. That’s a stark contrast from the previous game where Hornet shouted about a grave, and took off without providing any context. On that basis, I suppose it isn’t that egregious to mark where we’re headed next on the map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re 0 for 2 here, but I promise that I’ve got the perfect example this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reaching the peak of the Citadel, we’re greeted by a locked lift. We’re then informed that in order to unlock the lift, we’ll need to search around the Citadel for 3 ancient melodies &#8211; 1 for each of the major factions within the holy city. Once we’ve collected all 3, the way forward will finally open, and we can break the curse that has beset Pharloom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect! I bet this’ll be when Team Cherry finally relinquishes the responsibility of exploration. It’ll be just like how finding the Resting Grounds was left entirely up to the player without any explicit guidance, or quest markers to get in the way of organic exploration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right?</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Map of the Citadel after defeating the Cogwork Dancers, and being assigned the quest to find the 3 songs of the Citadel." class="wp-image-9655" height="346" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/map-after-cogwork-dancers.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this juncture, there’s no point in pretending anymore: there is no moment in <em>Silksong </em>that’s akin to discovering the Resting Grounds. The game is way too afraid of letting players become lost for that to happen. As such, clear directions are provided at every step of the journey alongside quest markers that spoil the fun of actually discovering anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The single exception to this level of hand holding is the hidden trigger for Act 3. As such, many players will finish <em>Silksong </em>without fighting a third of its bosses, nor seeing its true ending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t get it twisted though: once you’ve started Act 3, the quest markers return in full force. It doesn’t matter that this part of the game is obviously intended for the most dedicated players looking for an additional challenge. Nope. You’re never going to get a chance to flex those navigation chops whatsoever, nor will you be expected to explore the remainder of Pharloom organically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a brief aside, I think it’s also worth mentioning that <em>Silksong </em>provides this same level of guidance within its various side quests too. A perfect example of this can be seen with courier quests where players make deliveries to named NPCs throughout Pharloom. The quest giver lets players know exactly where they’re meant to go, and the delivery only becomes available after they’ve met the recipient. Regardless, a quest marker is still slapped onto the map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also realize that I’m (probably) going to sound like an asshole for complaining about the increased volume of guidance in <em>Silksong</em>. There are several people that I’ve spoken to over the years who bounced off <em>Hollow Knight</em> because of how directionless it felt. Having quest markers to clearly define where players are expected to go completely sidesteps this problem, which is a huge boon for anyone who couldn’t get into the original game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me though, I can’t help but feel like something was lost in translation going from <em>Hollow Knight</em> to <em>Silksong</em>. The sequel doubles down on challenging platforming with areas like Bilewater and Mount Fay, while introducing several bosses like Karmelita, Trobbio, and Last Judge which meet or eclipse the difficulty of <em>Hollow Knight’s</em> most infamous fights. By comparison, I’ve felt starved for the quiet exploration that made the original such an enjoyable experience. That lack of direction made <em>Hollow Knight</em> unique in a way few games dare to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all that, I’m left asking the question: is it wrong of me to want less guidance in <em>Silksong</em>? Perhaps. There’s a not insignificant chance that these changes have made <em>Silksong </em>far more accessible to a wider range of players when compared to the original game. That’s gotta count for something, even if these changes are a massive turn off for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I don’t really want <em>Silksong</em>, or games like it, to be made exclusively for rat-brained people like myself. Rather, I’d appreciate an option to disable quest markers, and explore as I see fit. Just give me a chance to actually breathe in Pharloom, and explore at my own pace instead of whisking me through a guided tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

Most of your playtime will be spent looking for clues, or interviewing the various guests of the titular manor. Once enough information is uncovered, the game will prompt the player to make a deduction, which involves filling in the blanks of a sentence with colour-coded words, and phrases. It should all look very familiar to anyone who has played either of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2024/11/30/devilish-deduction-the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review/">The Golden Idol</a></em> games, and is just as satisfying here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, for my money, the reason to put <em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em> on your radar is the spooky flourishes. There’s some grade A sound design on display in the demo, and there were a couple of moments where the occasional flash of an otherworldly creature caused me to lurch in my chair. I don’t know that any of these were jump scares per se, and they tied in nicely with the supernatural themes and spooky atmosphere of the game, so I’d call it all fairplay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other notable difference for <em>Blake Manor</em> from its contemporaries is the inclusion of a timer. Every interaction costs 1 minute, which limits the number of items that a player can reasonably interact with while solving particular quandaries throughout their journey. As such, players need to think carefully about what they do, and don’t interact with, which I thought was a refreshing twist over indiscriminately interacting with everything. Though, I actually enjoy the added tension of a good timer, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, <em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em> is definitely 1 to keep your eyes on if you’re into Detective games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="moonsigil-atlas">Moonsigil Atlas</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A Deckbuilder where your cards cost physical space on the game board to play instead of energy/mana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3284290/Moonsigil_Atlas/">Moonsigil Atlas</a></em> was 1 of 3 different demos that I had to pull myself away from early, so that I could continue playing the other demos that I had downloaded. If that doesn’t speak volumes about how fun it is, then I don’t know what does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the basic idea here is that every card has a sigil inscribed onto it. You’re then able to play said card as long as you can find room for it on your game board. At the end of each turn, your board is cleared, and you draw a new hand. In this way, <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> replaces a typical energy system with the ability for players to continue playing cards as long as they can find, or make space for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s really neat about this system is how it influences the rest of the game’s design, which is why <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> felt so fresh to play. For example, effects that create new cards require players to plan ahead so that they actually have the available space to play said cards. Likewise, any card with the Persist keyword will remain on the board, which also requires a bit of foresight so that you don’t end up inadvertently screwing yourself on a future turn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upgrade system is also affected by this design, and allows players to alter the shape of a card’s sigil in addition to augmenting its effects when played. Heck, there’s even an upgrade that allows you to swap the sigils of 2 cards, which can be useful for giving a powerful card a much smaller shape that’s easier to play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, you’ll also have to consider a card’s shape in addition to its effect before drafting it. Consideration for a card’s energy cost is also present in traditional Deckbuilders, but the higher degree of shape customization means that <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> has more granularity for what will, and won’t work well within a given deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s just so many interesting things that cascade throughout <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> because of this single foundation change. It feels like something I haven’t played before, and that’s always a welcome sight with Deckbuilders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-heavy-morning">A Heavy Morning</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>An interactive story about coping with depression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>I think it’s a really powerful feeling when you see yourself represented in a piece of media. It’s almost like you’re being acknowledged &#8211; like someone out there has seen you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, it can be a reminder that others have gone through similar experiences as you. That can be a really comforting sensation, especially while you’re actively working through those same experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say all of this as someone who has been attending therapy for depressive symptoms for over a year now. And it was really comforting to see some of my experiences represented so earnestly within <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3509400/A_Heavy_Morning/">A Heavy Morning’s</a></em> demo. It was a reminder that I’m not alone because of the authenticity, and sincerity with which the subject matter was presented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also liked how cognitive reframing, and box breathing were represented. Obviously, a video game isn’t going to fully capture the experience of using different cognitive behavioural therapy techniques to deal with depression, but I thought that <em>A Heavy Morning</em> did a faithful job of recreating both as interactive mini-games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably won’t be for everyone, but I’m glad that <em>A Heavy Morning</em> exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="monsters-are-coming">Monsters are Coming!

Instead of plopping your towers down from on high, you’d be right in the thick of it collecting resources, and defending your mobile fortress-city while fortifying its defences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I didn’t expect was that all of the actions performed by the player character would happen automatically. This puts Monsters are Coming inline with the deluge of other would-be successors to <em>Vampire Survivor’s</em> crown over the Bullet Heaven subgenre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, I thought <em>Monsters are Coming</em> was really damn compelling, and I had to tear myself away from it. There’s so much going on between collecting resources for your town, to actually building up your fortress’ economy, and defences. This meant that I was constantly bouncing around the screen trying to do something in service of the overarching goal of surviving the oncoming hordes. The result was a game that I found really compelling to play on a moment-to-moment basis, and the screen wasn’t a complete stimulus overload either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you, like myself, have found that Bullet Heaven games aren’t quite your cup of tea, then give <em>Monsters are Coming</em> a looksie. You might be pleasantly surprised like I was after finishing a few runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tearscape">Tearscape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>What if <em>Bloodborne </em>was 2D, and available on the <em>Gameboy Color</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>I’m not sure what <em>Bloodborne </em>did to everyone who played it, but I’m more than happy to keep trying games that are inspired by it. Doubly so if those games abandon the third dimension, and slap on a pleasantly nostalgic <em>Gameboy Color</em> aesthetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite that earlier comparison, the focus in <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3216340/Tearscape/">Tearscape</a> </em>isn’t exclusively on combat: it’s also a little puzzley. Though I wouldn’t say it’s puzzley in a traditional sense. Rather, <em>Tearscape </em>is puzzley in the same way that older games tended to be.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a quick example of what I mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While roaming around the graveyard at the start of the demo, I saw a locked chest off in the distance. I couldn’t get to said chest because it was behind a locked gate. I did however notice that there were some stairs next to the chest, so my assumption was that there must be an underground path that I’d missed. This was proven true a few screens over when I discovered the entrance to said tunnel hidden among a couple tombstones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that this sort of thing won’t be to everyone’s taste, but I felt really smart for identifying, and actually finding my way over to that chest. The contents of the chest weren’t even that substantive &#8211; the real reward was the dopamine hit from solving the puzzle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That aside, <em>Tearscape’s </em>combat was simple, but satisfying. It almost felt like 2D <em>Zelda </em>(which I believe is intentional), though the addition of a dodge roll, and parry do add a bit of necessary spice to the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re at all like me &#8211; easily won over by a game with a nostalgic artstyle, and some modern QoL tweaks &#8211; then <em>Tearscape </em>is something you should put on your radar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dead-weight">Dead Weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>Grid-based Tactics with sky pirates, defenestration, and a Roguelike twist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>You know what’s great? Defenestration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeatedly knocking people out of windows was part of what made last year’s <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2024/11/26/lets-get-tactical-tactical-breach-wizards-review/">Tactical Breach Wizards</a></em> such a joy to play. It almost feels like you’re cheating because you’ve effectively 1-shot an enemy, but done it in a way that doesn’t seem like it should be allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mention all of this because that same principle was adopted by <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2646720/Dead_Weight/">Dead Weight</a></em>. It’s a grid-based Tactics game where every character has a push action, and you can leverage that to send enemies to their untimely demise instead of doing things the old fashioned way. And I’m very much in the market for another game all about shoving people to death given that <em>TBW </em>was my favourite game from last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, it should be said that you can still do things the old fashioned way. In fact, leveraging a mix of both standard combat abilities, and defenestration proved vital in completing the tutorial run that was showcased by <em>Dead Weight’s</em> demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I still have some questions about how much run-to-run variance there will actually be in <em>Dead Weight</em>, I enjoyed what I played enough to throw it on my wishlist. The cadence of combat, and focus on positioning (for both offence, and defence) made for a strong impression, as did the excellent pixel art.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="whiskerwood">Whiskerwood</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A City Builder with <em>Redwall </em>vibes where you manage a village of anthropomorphic mice, and pay taxes to your cat overlords.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Gosh. Where do I even start with <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/">Whiskerwood</a></em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose I can start with the game’s visual appeal. I feel like I don’t need to explain that one too much. The folks at <em>Minakata Dynamics</em> could have used any muridae, but Mice do make for a particularly cute group of settlers. Plus, the different building designs are chock full of rustic appeal. I see enough glass, steel, and concrete in my day-to-day to where that’s a huge plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not all aesthetics that <em>Whiskerwood </em>has going for it though &#8211; the management side of things isn’t too shabby either. Right from the get go, you’re given taxes from the royal kingdom of cats that you’ll need to figure out how to pay. They send someone around to collect payments once every 3 days, so keeping on top of your economic exports is imperative to success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this isn’t too different from the kinds of drains that you’d find in other City Builders, I appreciate how it can be filled by whatever resources a player has on hand. Ore like copper, and gold go for the highest price, but if you’d like to save some of your reserves for later payments then you can opt to fill the remainder of your tax quota with excess lumber, fish, or thatch. It’s a nice addition that makes managing your economy in <em>Whiskerwood </em>feel a little less singularly focused on prospecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that I really liked about the <em>Whiskerwood </em>demo was how your mining activities terraform the playspace. I don’t know exactly how to articulate it, but it gives the world a sense of physicality, and place that other City Builders lack. I’d also hazard a guess that in longer playthroughs than my (limited) time with the demo, the constant erasure of space (thanks to continued mining) will lead to some interesting logistical problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="barrel-roll">Barrel Roll</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A Western themed Deckbuilder where your deck consists of the bullets in your revolver. Also, there are robots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp; </strong>I don’t think it’s a secret that I enjoy Roguelike Deckbuilders. I’ve been writing this blog for almost a decade now, and a new card game has made it onto my “best of” year-end list just about every single year. Heck, last year there were 2, and I have it on good authority that there’ll be another 2 Deckbuilders claiming top 10 spots for 2025 as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s all a really long way of saying that I’m keen to find, and play new takes on the genre. So you can imagine my excitement when I watched the Steam trailer for <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3860590/Barrel_Roll/">Barrel Roll</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it might not be a Deckbuilder in a wholly traditional sense, <em>Barrel Roll</em> has all the typical trappings that I look for from the genre. You’re drafting abilities, you have limited access to said abilities, and it takes careful planning and forethought to properly execute your strategy. It just so happens that you’re shooting your cards out of a revolver because they’re bullet-shaped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing that really set <em>Barrel Roll</em> apart for me though was how players are expected to manage their resources. You can only shoot each of your bullets once before you need to reload, and you’re limited to the next 3 bullets in the revolver when choosing your next shot. This makes the process of actually navigating your shots, and choosing when to reload a big part of your overarching strategy, which I really enjoyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The visuals, and music were also killer. I mean…just look at it. The use of cell-shading really works wonders here for giving <em>Barrel Roll</em> a striking appearance to set itself apart from other games. And the twangy Western sounds alongside a classic rock guitar riff for the main battle theme was chef’s kiss.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="xanthiom-2">Xanthiom 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A Metroidvania with open-ended exploration where you customize your weapon on the fly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts:\xa0 </strong>It’s a quiet, moody Metroidvania. That’s basically my favourite breed of this sort of thing, and <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2555390/Xanthiom_2/">Xanthiom 2</a></em> hit all the right notes for me. Doubly so since I was able to explore as I saw fit following the briefest of tutorials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well…okay that’s a bit of a misnomer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would’ve been able to explore as I saw fit, but the demo was limited in scope to just a handful of areas. Despite this, I still managed to find the entrances to 3 different areas that were off limits in the demo, which I’m going to take as meaning that I <em>could </em>have explored more freely were I not playing a demo. It was a promising sign, and has me hopeful that the full game will actually let me roam freely even if I get myself killed in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other really neat thing here was the return of modular gun customization from the original game. This lets players tweak the properties of their weapon for both puzzle solving, and combat related challenges. For example, one of the doors in the demo requires your weapon to have both a 50% range increase, and 50% fire rate increase mod installed to trigger the locking mechanism. It’s a really neat system with a ton of potential, and I’m keen to see exactly how it’s leveraged throughout the full game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think it’s high time I finally get around to the original game, <em>Xanthiom Zero</em>, which I’ve been meaning to play for a couple of months now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cairn">Cairn</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A game about rock climbing. I promise that’s way more interesting than I just made it sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>It’s a little surprising to me that it took until (relatively) recently for games to start exploring rock climbing as a form of movement. In my mind, it shares a lot of overlap with one of video gaming’s oldest genres: platforming. The core difference being that you’re deciding where to place your character’s hands, instead of where to place your character’s feet. In both cases, there is a large focus on movement, and figuring out how to reach your destination with said movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there’ve been an array of indie titles released over the past few years to rectify this shortcoming from <em>Valley Peaks</em>, to <em>Jusant</em>, to <em>PEAK</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, thus far there hasn’t been a game that’s tried to realistically simulate the experience of rock climbing. All of those aforementioned titles sacrifice realism for accessibility, and a smoother gameplay experience. That is not the case for <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">Cairn</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say that <em>Cairn </em>is painfully realistic would be an understatement. When you misplace your footing, you fall. When you land, it hurts. A lot. And the injuries impede your ability to climb back up to where you fell from. Plus you’ll need to keep Aava, <em>Cairn’s </em>protagonist, fed and hydrated because she’ll build up fatigue a lot faster without any fuel in the tank, which will only make climbing harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you know what? There’s a strange sort of serenity born out of accepting all of this, and silently overcoming it. I had a few tumbles, but I kept getting back up until I eventually conquered the demo. This all left me with the impression that <em>Cairn </em>will be an almost meditative experience for a certain type of person, and I think that I’m here for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, if anyone from the development team happens to read this: y’all need someone, or a team of someones to make the game run a smidge better. I ran into a lot of performance issues with the demo, despite running it on the lowest settings. I eventually managed to get a stable framerate, but using the flashlight at night still tanked performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it’d be a shame if optimization related shenanigans mire the reception to <em>Cairn </em>as it’s a really interesting experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="crashout-crew">Crashout Crew</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>a new co-op game from <em>Aggro Crab</em> (the co-creators of <em>PEAK</em>) where you, and up to 4 friends play forklift drivers in a mayhem filled warehouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I feel like I might catch some flack for this (since I didn’t really like <em>PEAK</em>), but I had a lot of fun playing <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583210/Crashout_Crew/">Crashout Crew</a></em>. I think a lot of that comes down to the common DNA that it shares with <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2019/01/20/overcooked-2-review/">Overcooked</a></em>. Driving around a warehouse to prep a variety of ridiculous deliveries while meteors shower down from the heavens has a very similar energy to the chaotic kitchens of <em>Overcooked’s </em>best levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I do feel like <em>Crashout Crew </em>doesn’t have the same sorts of levers for ratcheting up tension as <em>Overcooked</em>. While playing with my wife, it was very easy to segregate different tasks, so that we never had to actually cross paths with one another. And a lot of the game’s difficulty bottoms out when you’re not crashing into one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that might have been a result of us not using proximity voice chat since we’re sitting less than 10 feet from one another. I have to assume <em>Crashout Crew</em> is a lot more chaotic when you can’t clearly relay information between 2 players who’re constantly on opposite sides of a level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those f-king chickens still got us once they started running around though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I think it’s fair to say that <em>Aggro Crab</em> has the makings of another hit multiplayer game on their hands here. The simplicity of <em>Crashout Crew</em> keeps the skill floor low enough so that anyone with a willing group of friends can jump right in, and have a good time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh right. Hats! The game has funny hats. My favourite thing!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-medium"><img alt="Funny Karen hairstyle from Crashout Crew." class="wp-image-9638" height="293" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/karen-hair.png?w=300" width="300" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>One of them is even this ridiculous Karen looking hair. If that doesn’t make <em>Crashout Crew</em> an all timer then I don’t know what does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, we’re done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m acutely aware of how late I’ll be posting this. Thankfully, most developers leave their demos live after <em>Next Fest</em> concludes, so you should be able to play the demo for any titles that caught your eye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, again, don’t forget about wishlisting. It’s free, and helps a ton.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

Here’s the list of games I was playing throughout September:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#ggst">Guilty Gear Strive</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#sudoku">Sudoku</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; it was a bit of a light month. That’s entirely my fault.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ggst">Guilty Gear Strive</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m sure this will come as a surprise to no one: <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> dominated my gaming time throughout September. The addition of the <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/">newly improved ranked mode</a>, and proper matchmaking made <em>Strive </em>a lot more fun to play when compared against my previous experience with the game. Turns out I’ll actually stick around for longer sessions if I’m not constantly being bombarded by messages about connection failure. Who’d a thunk it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the main draw for my time commitment throughout September was twofold: updating my <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/01/19/guilty-gear-strive-may-guide-for-beginner-combos/">May Beginners Guide</a>, and playing more Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The May guide took about 10 days of on again, off again work to actually hammer through, but I’m fairly pleased with how it turned out. In general, I think the guide does a better job of handing new players safer combo routing that they can use as a springboard for playing May.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also ended up redoing all of the videos for said guide, which meant that I could finally remove all of the background noise. I didn’t even realize it, but <em>Strive </em>plays a wind sound effect passively in the background of every stage. Normally, this extra sound is imperceptible because of the game’s music, but it’s very apparent when you have said music muted so people can’t tell how often you’re cutting between shots in an edited combo video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, those videos feel like they’re better put together now. It was definitely worth the effort even though it took me over a day’s worth of effort to capture, edit, and render 22 new videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing the May guide, my attention fell squarely on Dizzy. Originally, I’d intended to keep bouncing back and forth between her, and May. However, I had so much fun playing Dizzy that I just kept playing her, and eventually reached parity between the 2. At least, that’s true as far as my online ranking is concerned. I’m still far more comfortable using May in bracket, and am much better at putting together loose spaghetti combos with May than I am with Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Dizzy is far more fun to play now than she was before, which I was really surprised by. I wrote about it in length <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/09/27/revisiting-dizzy-at-the-end-of-strive-season-4/">here</a>, but the short version is that Dizzy has more situations where she can score a knockdown which increases her consistency. This is a stark contrast to when Dizzy first launched, and stray hits wouldn’t result in any follow through unless you had Ice Field active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I won’t profess to be an expert, I have had a lot of fun using Dizzy’s different tools to completely lock down my opponents. Nothing feels quite like keeping someone jailed at the far end of the screen while they helplessly flail around. Doubly so because smothering someone to death is non-trivial thanks to the bevy of movement options that exist. I guess Totsu was right all those months ago when he told me that I’d probably enjoy playing a zoner in <em>Strive</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I think the biggest takeaway here is that I’ve been enjoying the process of learning again. Fighting games, specifically <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, were starting to feel really stagnant for me over the past few months. Returning to <em>Strive</em>, and focusing (mostly) on a new character have helped to really reignite my passion for the genre. I think there might be something to that, but I’d prefer to explore it in detail within a dedicated post, so I’ll put a pin in that for later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sudoku">Sudoku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; I’ve continued to play <em>Sudoku</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t have a whole lot to say on this front, but I’ve gotten a lot better at solving the <em>NYT</em>, and <em>LA Times’</em> boards by sticking to Schneider notation. This involves only marking out when a number can appear in 2 different cells within a box, row, or column. The main advantage here is that you don’t clutter the entire <em>Sudoku </em>board with information that can’t be acted upon, while also providing yourself with better information to fill in additional spaces whenever you place another number.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This video probably explains it better, honestly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, as someone who typically struggles to solve boards when there are too many candidates listed across several spaces, I really like Schneider notation. It makes many of these more challenging puzzles a lot more approachable than they were when I’d get buried in the weeds of numerous different candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is an unfortunate downside of Schneider notation: it forced me to learn at a pace that I didn’t find particularly accommodating. Schneider notation is heavily reliant on the <em>Sudoku </em>player’s ability to reliably spot, and infer intersections while solving the puzzle in question. As a result, I had to get a LOT better at spotting this pattern so I could actually make use of this particular solving strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, it’s cool that I can use Schneider notation as I find it far easier to solve puzzles by using it. On the other hand, I’d have appreciated a more gradual build up to this point. Instead, I feel like I immediately rushed hard mode, which added a lot of friction to the entire learning process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, <em>Sudoku </em>is still very fun, and very satisfying. I’d highly recommend checking it out, especially if you’re looking for a way to give your brain a daily mental workout.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like so many other people, I was playing <em>Silksong </em>throughout September. What might surprise you is that I didn’t start playing it until the 20th, so I’ve not actually finished the game yet. I do think I’m over the halfway mark though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also going to skip actually introducing what <em>Silksong </em>is because I’m assuming everyone, and their dog already knows about this game. It was the source of many memes, and much speculative hype right up until it came out. This was swiftly followed by people complaining about the game being too hard, which I can&#8217;t comment on because I started playing it after the first difficulty nerf patch went live.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, <em>Silksong </em>is a game of high peaks, and low valleys for me. The areas where it meaningfully improves upon its predecessor make <em>Silksong </em>among one of my favourite games to bless the Metroidvania subgenre. However, there are a few aspects of <em>Silksong </em>that I actively question because they repeatedly interrupt the flow of exploration, and largely contribute to it feeling like a less well put together package than its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I kind of want to cover off exactly what I mean by all of that in a longer post, but I’m afraid I’ll get lost in the weeds while writing so here’s the Cliff’s notes version:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>The music by Chris Larkin is fantastic</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The wider variety of environments, and greater use of colour are a welcome change</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hornet’s movement abilities feel fantastic to use, and help to immediately distinguish her from the previous title’s hero</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enemy and boss designs (both visual, and mechanical) are great</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The newly added Crest system provides a much needed revamp to the Badge system of the previous title</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Side quests actively detract from the game, and feel like unnecessary padding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The propensity for <em>Silksong </em>to lock players into combat arenas with a deluge of common enemies is boring, predictable, and also feels like unnecessary padding</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, I’ve been having a lot of fun exploring every corner of the game, but I can’t shake the feeling that <em>Silksong </em>is collapsing under its own weight. It feels a lot more overtly video game-y, and bloated in the way that open world games do thanks to the inclusion of really nebulous side quests, and combat arenas. When I’m able to quietly explore, and untangle its labyrinthine maze of a world, I’m at my happiest. However, <em>Silksong </em>seems <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/10/20/i-dont-want-to-hold-your-hand-silksong/">hellbent on ensuring that those moments are few and far between</a> thanks to an endless deluge of unnecessary interruptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully that explains what I meant by high peaks, and low valleys.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I decided that I wanted something less action-y to play in my evenings so I started up <em>Strange Horticulture</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I say that, but I also wanted to see if I even enjoyed the game. The reason being is Mir wanted to play the sequel, <em>Strange Antiquities</em>, alongside me instead of playing it alone like she did with the first game. As such, I’ve been working my way through <em>Strange Horticulture</em> the past few evenings, so I could give an informed yay or nay to that request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who were as blissfully unaware of this game as I was, <em>Strange Horticulture</em> is a game where you run a shop by the same name, which sells strange plants. Unfortunately, none of the plants are actually labelled, so it’s your job to research, and deduce which plants are which. Ergo, this is a bit of a Detective game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, most of the puzzles haven’t been that involved, and it doesn’t seem like that’ll change either. Instead, the occult story that’s been brewing in the background is starting to take hold, so that appears like it’ll be the focus of the back half of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little disappointed by the lack of puzzles, but I am keen to see where the story goes. Hopefully <em>Strange Horticulture</em> can wrap things up in a satisfying sort of way before I completely check out due to the lack of puzzle variety, and challenge though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for whether I’ll play the sequel with my wife, I guess you’ll have to tune in next month to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, I think we’ll call it for September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, as always, for reading if you made it this far, and stay safe out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

The announcement and release of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/07/23/every-card-is-a-puzzle-in-monster-train-2/">Monster Train 2</a></em> was totally unexpected, <em>Silksong </em>&amp; <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/06/19/surface-runs-add-a-fresh-new-twist-to-hades-2/">Hades 2</a></em> both shadow dropped this month, and <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/"><em>Strive </em>received a proper ranked mode</a> 4 years after its initial release. There were also games like <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/09/02/month-in-review-duck-detective-peak-grounded-2-more/#ooo">Öoo</a></em>, <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/29/tactical-space-invaders-starvaders-review/">StarVaders</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/07/genius-deduction-the-roottrees-are-dead-review/">The Roottrees are Dead</a></em> which totally blew me away despite the limited fanfare they received in the lead up to their respective launch dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, 2025 doesn’t appear to be slowing down with the surprises because a demo for <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> dropped 2 weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who aren’t already aware, this is the next project from <em>Radical Fish Games</em>, the creators of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2018/11/21/crosscode-review/">CrossCode</a></em>. Yes &#8211; that <em>CrossCode</em>. The same <em>CrossCode </em>with gorgeous pixel art, fantastic puzzle-filled dungeons, and one of the most heartfelt narratives that I’ve ever experienced in a video game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say that I’m a little excited about <em>Radical Fish Games’</em> next project would be an understatement. Learning about, and subsequently playing the demo for <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> was akin to my experience with <em>Monster Train 2</em> earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, said demo has fanned the flames of my excitement, and now I’m very much looking forward to the <em>Early Access</em> release of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>, which is (currently) slated for the first half of 2026.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself (again).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome back to another <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/tag/demo-dive/">Demo Dive</a></em> where today we’ll be taking a look at <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>, <em>Radical Fish Games’</em> follow-up to <em>CrossCode</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, let’s start by answering the question: what is <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to <em>CrossCode</em>, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> is an Action RPG with many of the trappings of RPGs from the 16-bit era. That is to say it has the simple, but satisfying combat of something like <em>Diablo</em>, but the narrative structure and cadence of something like <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, or <em>Earthbound</em>. It’s a blending that works quite well for someone like myself who has little patience for simple turn-based combat, but otherwise doesn’t mind the winding narrative structure typical in this sort of RPG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I appreciated some of the changes that <em>Radical Fish</em> has made when compared to their previous work namely as it relates to combat. If memory serves, <em>CrossCode </em>was very button mashy in the combat department with a simple 3 hit combo, alongside a handful of special moves. By comparison, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> features a few more combo types, which players can access by inputting their attacks with a slightly different rhythm. It’s akin to how many other 2D action games have implemented their combo systems, and it makes a welcome appearance here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> features several weapon types which each have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, the sword is fast, but deals less damage than the bulky hammer making it ideal for players who want to attack more aggressively. However, the sword only deals slicing damage, which makes it totally ineffective against enemies with tough shells. That’s where the hammer will come in handy. As such, players need to adjust their approach in combat to account for the different weaknesses of what they’re fighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a really big fan of this addition as it makes combat just that little bit more involved. It’s not so overbearing as to become the focus of the game, but it does lend itself to making fights feel like an active component of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> instead of the thing you do to fill time in between everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from combat, the other aspects that <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo was keen to showcase are the return of Zelda-esque dungeons, and the narrative hook for the story. Unfortunately, you’re only allowed to explore the first dungeon up to the point where you unlock the dungeon’s key item, meaning that the majority of the interesting puzzles, and combat encounters are locked beyond the confines of the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I wouldn’t be upset about being cut off were I not having fun. What’s on offer was really enjoyable even if it was limited in scope. Besides, <em>CrossCode </em>has some of the best constructed puzzle dungeons that I’ve ever played through, so I have every confidence that <em>Radical Fish</em> will deliver in full force with this area of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final bit that I wanted to touch on with regard to <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo is the story. I won’t be speaking about the specifics &#8211; the demo is around 2 hours long, so you can play it yourself if you’re curious. Instead, I wanted to focus on how <em>Radical Fish</em> smartly uses hooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The demo begins with a brief introduction that speaks of a world ending apocalypse (named Nyx), which is swiftly followed by a tutorial section wherein you play as some of the chosen heroes meant to repel said apocalypse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things don’t quite work out though, so everything is a little out of sorts once players take control of <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> protagonist Juno.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then learn that Juno was meant to be travelling with the group of heroes we saw during the tutorial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my money, this setup was perfect. It immediately introduced the game world, set up 2 different sources of conflict, and left me with questions that I’m interested in pursuing the answers to. For example, why wasn’t Juno with the party of chosen heroes? That immediately introduces some intrigue, while also setting up a source of conflict to build the story around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might sound like I’m praising <em>Radical Fish</em> for doing the bare minimum, but you’d be surprised just how many games get this wrong. Basically any author worth their salt knows this sort of introduction is an easy way to draw the reader into your story. It gives them something to latch onto so they can cruise through the remaining character introductions throughout the opening act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, writing is rarely the focal point for many games. As such, games are usually a lot more reliant on visual set pieces, or mechanical complexity for drawing players in. It’s for this reason that I found <em>Radical Fish’s</em> use of narrative hooks so refreshing. Doubly so since it communicated to me that they’re looking to make the story of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> as much of a focal point as it was in <em>CrossCode</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, I’m typically a much more mechanically minded player &#8211; I think even a cursory glance at my other written work will reveal as much &#8211; so <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> getting its narrative hooks into me has gotta count for something, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I close out here, there are 2 other things that I wanted to (briefly) mention: the artwork, and music. I already thought <em>Radical Fish’s</em> previous work looked great, but the pixel art, and character animation are even more well done here. It’s almost unbelievable how good the game looks. Kudos to the art team!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along those same lines, I thought all of the music within <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo was great. Every track fit the accompanying locale, cutscene, or set piece to a tee which did a lot of heavy lifting for setting the appropriate tone throughout the demo. Again, big kudos to the folks responsible for the music as you absolutely nailed the assignment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that I think I’ve covered everything that I wanted to say about <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>. Obviously, I’m coming at it from the lens of someone who both played, and really enjoyed <em>CrossCode</em>, which might not be true for all of you. I feel like the demo showed that <em>Radical Fish</em> are doubling down on what made <em>CrossCode </em>so great, and I’m very eager to get my hands on the full release whenever they finish cooking it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I’ll have to wait a fair bit as <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> is planned for an <em>Early Access</em> launch in the first half of 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, if you’d like to check out the demo for yourself &#8211; and I think you should as it’s fantastic &#8211; then you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3110760/Alabaster_Dawn/">here via <em>Steam</em></a>.

My general takeaways were mostly negative even though I found her really fun to play. There were a lot of small reasons for that, but the biggest unifying theme of my complaints was that her design felt muddled. Her tools seemed built with zoning in mind, but she was fairly mediocre at keep-out. She wasn’t much better at traditional strike-throw offense either, which left Dizzy in this weird limbo state where she couldn’t do anything particularly well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t the only person who came to this conclusion about Dizzy either. Over the next several weeks, countless tier lists were published by different notable players, and every single one of them put Dizzy in the bottom tier. Heck, some even said she was the worst character in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this isn’t the first time that people have claimed a newly released character was the worst in <em>Strive</em>, so it’s important to take such claims with a grain of salt. Infamously, some said that Happy Chaos was trash when he was first released. In the following months, Happy Chaos crept to the top of most player’s tier lists, and also won <em>EVO </em>2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, in fairness, that <em>EVO </em>win came after Happy Chaos received totally unnecessary buffs to the majority of his attacking moves. This was done as a way to compensate for a nerf to the character’s zoning capabilities, but many considered this change a massive net positive for the Happy Chaos playerbase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the point remains that many people had grossly underestimated the strength of Happy Chaos upon his initial release. As such, it wasn’t unreasonable to think that myself, and others might have missed the mark with Dizzy too. Perhaps there was something we’d missed that would unlock the true potential of the character.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as weeks turned into months, people continued to nod their head in agreement about Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, this was extremely vindicating. I don’t always have the most confidence in my opinions as it relates to Fighting games, so it was nice to see a bunch of other players (at various levels of play) all coming to the same conclusion that I did with my initial assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this also kind of sucked because I really enjoyed playing Dizzy (when she worked). That sort of sentiment shouldn’t ever stop you from playing a character that you enjoy, but it’s hard to maintain a consistent level of enthusiasm when you’re reminded how much easier it’d be to just play somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there were 2 major balance patches to <em>Strive </em>between when I last played Dizzy and now. Surely, <em>Arc System Works</em> buffed her to a point where she can actually compete, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>…Right?</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Guilty Gear Strives version 1.43 patch notes for Dizzy where she was nerfed just as much as she was buffed." class="wp-image-9603" height="508" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dizzy-patch-notes-v-143.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Guys?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All joking aside, here’s the list of (relevant) changes that Dizzy received across those 2 patches:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>For Roasting Chestnuts (236K)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>First hit no longer counts as a projectile &amp; hitbox size increased</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Causes a knockdown on hit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can now neutralize other projectiles</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Far Slash (f.S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Increased hitbox</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crouching Slash (2S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Increased hitbox</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Michael Sword (214S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Causes a knockdown on hit</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I Used This to Catch Fish (236S|H)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>More than doubled the active frames of the attack</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frozen State\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>No longer (erroneously) triggers a wall break</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a change that buffed the power of Yellow Roman Cancel, and damage was nerfed across the board. Both of these changes were huge for Dizzy since it increased her defensive utility, and brought her damage output inline with the rest of the cast. In fact, you could reasonably argue that Dizzy was one of the biggest beneficiaries of both changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, after a few more weeks of playing Dizzy, what do I think of her now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a short video that I believe accurately captures my impressions:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This character is a lot better at zoning now. Her tools actually compliment one another thanks to the additional knockdown opportunities afforded by both versions of Michael Sword, and Chestnut. In all cases, Dizzy has the option to set up additional projectiles, Wings of Light, or Ice Field which allows her to run her gameplan a lot more consistently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, she has stronger tools (namely For Roasting Chestnuts) for challenging the other cast members when she gets into a zoning war. This means that she doesn’t feel completely defenseless like she used to when she had to rely solely on I Used This to Catch Fish, which was too slow to meaningfully challenge most of the cast with any degree of consistency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the massive buff to I Used This to Catch Fish is certainly the highlight of the current patch, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find the changes to Chestnut from the previous patch to be more impactful. It’s actually wild how much mileage I can get out of this special attack now. It helps to keep folks locked down, and the added knockdown makes it very easy to consistently place Ice Field. This is notable as the added icy terrain makes it much harder for opponents to approach Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I can’t overlook the changes to I Used This to Catch Fish. The almost <em>40 frames</em> that this attack is active for is insane. I’ve caught so many people off guard with this attack because it’s active for so long. I think it sits firmly in gimmick territory, but I’d be lying if I said that it wasn’t an effective gimmick. And that makes it a nice option to exercise, especially against players who’re unfamiliar with Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also loving the hitbox changes on Dizzy’s Slash normals. The extended hitbox on Far Slash has led to several instances where I’ve had it clash with an opponent’s reversal (invulnerable get-off me attacks like Shoryuken), which led to an advantageous follow-up for me. This is the sort of power I was used to wielding while playing May, and having it now on Dizzy has made her feel a lot better overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Crouching Slash is basically just May’s Crouching Slash from before it was nerfed to be 10% slower. That attack was best-in-class prior to the nerf, so Dizzy having an equally strong attack here feels so good. Plus, Crouching Slash was (it still is, honestly) my favourite way to control space with May, and it works just as well on Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All said, I think Dizzy is in a much better place now than she was when she first released. She feels like a solid middle of the pack character, with well defined strengths to accompany her many weaknesses. She has a very strong presence from everywhere on the screen, and can easily suffocate her opponent after she builds up some momentum. That said, all of her attacks have exploitable dead zones, and she still struggles to cover the space above her head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I’ve continued to have a ton of fun playing Dizzy. More so than before I’d wager. I wasn’t expecting much given how few changes she’s received over the past year, but it seems like those changes targeted the areas where Dizzy needed the most help. Now she feels like a strong zoner with unique tools, instead of direction-less generalist with meagre damage output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also felt comfortable enough to use Dizzy last week in bracket at locals, and I won all 5 games where I played her. Granted, I was still playing May for the majority of my games, but it was nice to finally show off the work I’ve been putting in with Dizzy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s hoping that I continue to have fun as I progress even further with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

I have a really hard time empathizing with how tricky someone else will find different types of puzzles. That can make it hard to communicate exactly why a particular Puzzle game did or did not work for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as an example, my friends Charlie and Thomas are both very logical thinkers, and can juggle a bunch of abstract information in their minds. As a result, they find a lot of Puzzle games far too simple. There’ve been very few instances over the years where I’ve recommended a Puzzle game to either of them, and had them come back saying they actually enjoyed it. Instead, I usually get hit with, “It was neat, but a little too simple.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So…you know…that doesn’t exactly make me very confident in my abilities to recommend Puzzle games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I finished a demo for <em>The Art of Reflection</em> earlier this week, and I had to talk about it. Mostly because it is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, I’ll start Demo Dive with a brief overview of <em>The Art of Reflection</em>, though I think the attached trailer does a fairly good job of showcasing what the game is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Art of Reflection</em> is a First-Person Puzzle game with realistically simulated mirrors. Also, you can enter the mirrors. This is the foundation from which <em>The Art of Reflection</em> builds all of its puzzles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a quick example of exactly what that entails, 1 of the first puzzles that players are asked to solve in the demo involves a locked door, and a key. Unfortunately, the door requires a mirrored version of the key that you’re provided with. Luckily, you can pop through a mirror, grab a mirrored version of the key, and return to the original door which you’ll now be able to open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s notes: I only realized after the fact that this is the first puzzle in the trailer, and now feel like a doofus for using it as an example. Still &#8211; you get the idea!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a fairly basic puzzle, but that should give you an idea of what <em>The Art of Reflection</em> has going on. It’s puzzles built around reflection, and perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, I was a little dubious about how much mileage the developers <a href="https://x.com/hydrozoagames">Hydrozoa</a> could get out of that idea, but the demo did a lot to assuage my concerns. Every new room I entered either presented a completely new idea, or meaningfully built upon a previous puzzle. That gave the whole demo a great sense of momentum, and also made the whole thing very satisfying to unravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I do have to call out my favourite moment from the demo, so skip this paragraph if you don’t want to be spoiled. The first time I entered a mirror on the ceiling, and inverted gravity was so cool. I was not expecting that at all, but playing around with gravity by flipping the entire world upside down was a really neat twist on the game’s core mechanics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also got the sense that I missed a few different puzzles throughout the demo. There were these collectible pillars that you were awarded for completing several consecutive rooms. Each one seemed to increase the amount of music playing for all of the levels attached to a particular hub. I figured that the demo didn’t contain all of the levels, specifically so the developers could showcase the breadth of ideas that they had, but the message at the end of the demo makes me think that I just missed several puzzles that were hidden off the beaten path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that’s the case, that’s also really neat. I’m always a fan of Puzzle games hiding additional puzzles behind these sorts of challenges. It’s a bit of a twist on simply solving a level to unlock the next since you need to work out exactly where the hidden thing is in the first place. That’s a commitment to puzzle solving that I can appreciate in a Puzzle game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you miss those hidden levels, it’s not really a big deal? Most Puzzle games are satisfying to solve irrespective of whether or not you completed all of their most tricky conundrums. Hell, most players won’t even notice that they’ve missed anything unless you tell them. My experience is proof positive of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I think <em>The Art of Reflection</em> looks very promising. The demo has certainly wet my appetite for the full game, which releases on November 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to try <em>The Art of Reflection</em> for yourself, there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2290770/The_Art_of_Reflection/">demo currently available on Steam</a>. And don’t forget to wishlist the game if you enjoyed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

As mentioned in <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-state-of-my-wow-ing.html">a previous post</a>, I wasn\'t quite sure what to expect - while I enjoyed MoP Remix, the news I\'d seen coming out of the PTR about this new installment didn\'t sound particularly encouraging, and unlike many, I don\'t have any nostalgia for Legion since I wasn\'t subscribed for that expansion. I only experienced its story for the first time <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2021/10/more-on-legion.html">about four years ago</a>, when the husband and I levelled a pair of demon hunters through Legion Chromie Time, and while I came away with a vague feeling of "I can see why people enjoyed this at the time", it\'s not the same thing as when you were there yourself.</p><p>Anyway, last week "Lemix" finally arrived, and it\'s been pretty fun! In a departure from our usual tendency to roll tank/healer duos, and considering how superfluous I\'d ended up feeling as a healer in MoP Remix, I created a Kul Tiran blood death knight as my first character, and my husband accompanied me as a gnome warlock. I\'d forgotten just how fast you fly through the levels in Remix, and we levelled this first set of characters all the way to the cap right there on that first weekend.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3ws4vRlhA5nhKxPsqKNvLYgBhL1c8j3vI88nYIvSOfvKpRNErc099ikoGdEUlsM0faUxNmZUpn74qrlTjBfllDm3d0HZdq-74abDnJL0Tz2U9wOxZLB4e7cjxqE77f4-SMFSkw6C4G_Lk-KSCpuDeLfVLB7MhfNGH1y5GWtt8AaB6vhAtZqcHvMKXBo-V/s1673/Kinta%20and%20Wopek.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Kul Tiran death knight sitting down at Krasus\' Landing to be face to face with a male gnome" border="0" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3ws4vRlhA5nhKxPsqKNvLYgBhL1c8j3vI88nYIvSOfvKpRNErc099ikoGdEUlsM0faUxNmZUpn74qrlTjBfllDm3d0HZdq-74abDnJL0Tz2U9wOxZLB4e7cjxqE77f4-SMFSkw6C4G_Lk-KSCpuDeLfVLB7MhfNGH1y5GWtt8AaB6vhAtZqcHvMKXBo-V/w400-h200/Kinta%20and%20Wopek.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><i>When you have to sit down to be at eye level with your spouse.&nbsp;</i></p><p>I will say that I was also reminded of some of the things that I <i>didn\'t</i> like about the last Remix at the beginning - the sheer speed of progression is extremely good at/bad for making you feel larger than usual levels of FOMO, because you log in for the first time on day three and people who\'ve had nothing else to do during that time are already running around one-shotting everything, making you feel like you\'re hopelessly behind and will never catch up. But of course that\'s not true - progression is very quick for <i>everyone</i>; I just can\'t deny that it\'s a bit intimidating at first. Never mind the prompt on the character selection screen that constantly tells you that there are only X days left in Remix.</p><p>I\'d also forgotten about my ambiguous relationship with the dungeon rushing meta. Sometimes it\'s funny to zone in and see some demon hunter just zoom ahead and kill everything before you can even get anywhere close. Other times though it just feels tedious to spend the whole dungeon jogging after someone else, unable to actually contribute anything and possibly not even getting any loot (the Postmaster will only recover certain types of items). It just requires a certain mental adjustment that whenever I zone into a pug instance, I can\'t expect to have much fun and have to accept that I\'m just gonna be in and out to get something specific done/get my participation medal.</p><p>(The glorious exception to this that actually made me squee with delight was the Court of Stars run in which I was the one to successfully identify the spy at the end. People have explained to me in the past how that puzzle works, and I figured I\'d understood it, but in practice I\'d just never been the first one to find and talk to the right NPC. Actually having that honour for the first time felt weirdly validating and exciting.)</p><p>Anyway, I\'d like to talk a bit about what\'s the same and what\'s different in Legion Remix compared to the MoP variant.</p><p>Lore-wise, the Infinite Dragonflight is experimenting again and we\'re time-travelling to help them out. I think the quest writers must have had a lot of fun coming up with explanations for certain mechanical changes that poke fun at the game while also making a weird kind of sense in-universe. Legion is one of those expansions where everyone addresses you as "champion" because the presumption was that your character would\'ve levelled through the five previous expansions and defeated all kinds of potential world-ending threats. How do you reconcile that with dropping a freshly created level 10 into the storyline at this point? Your Infinite Dragonflight companion has answers:</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN3E3tkyryxgNE75BIIhHkSPN1xht8HNTczxYtRybh8XX26mpqB7KUhWfjWxyjuh9FClMONWLgZoGZe7M4mcITRCUMvXDPkKeLqSrVEgFy7Tfp9wdx3aHet3PwdgEmt6NFuikxvq27CdCLVdt9Mja3N6VWxRVdek2IgtI9UIeyLWbhRlnZav-58OFzJwfv/s655/Moratari%20explains%20your%20amnesia.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A WoW &quot;talking head&quot; quest pop-up.

So, we have to be wise about how we spend our time." And then the quest just auto-completes. Considering they included these kinds of mobile-style waiting games in four expansions until they eventually left them behind with Shadowlands, it just cracked me up to have your in-game guide effectively admit that these systems are a waste of time, never mind.</p><p>Gear-scrapping and Bronze dropping as a currency everywhere are back, though the latter can no longer be used to increase your item level and <i>only</i> serves as currency to buy cosmetics this time, something that many people requested after the last Remix. I\'m actually not sure how the gearing up works this time around. I tried to read up on it but found even the guides a bit unclear. It doesn\'t seem to matter though as simply doing various bits of content every so often rewards me with gear boxes that increase my item level ever so slightly, so I guess I\'ll just keep doing that and maybe it\'ll become more clear over time.</p><p>Instead of a magic cloak that constantly increases in power, we got the Legion artifact weapons growing with us this time. This generally seems to work well, except (in my opinion) for the missions to acquire the artifact weapons for your other specs, as these force you to respec and unequip your current artifact, making you feel terribly weak for the duration of those quests. There\'s also no power transfer to alts this time around, not even a little bit, with the exception of the event\'s XP bonus.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh48AE3zo6xUGfjslSGI0RhqVKqQgoBj68oioS3gWMmR0jAROj3wwouTVSEYnRbPGbxvy75qpCX-P4DHf_vrmc3TfOi89ZWu5Fzon5XWBnJP8zS2WGUPYb4bGx9vmmTrTD7VK6pbkdU_GXG7arNRqgBWrmeOvDhXAjEmpPjRL4r3ANM70PIxuxUS4ZHiSce/s221/Legion%20Remix%20XP%20buff%20on%20a%20new%20alt.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The tooltip for &quot;Infinite Power&quot; shows that my alt has +83% experience gain but only +1 stamina." border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh48AE3zo6xUGfjslSGI0RhqVKqQgoBj68oioS3gWMmR0jAROj3wwouTVSEYnRbPGbxvy75qpCX-P4DHf_vrmc3TfOi89ZWu5Fzon5XWBnJP8zS2WGUPYb4bGx9vmmTrTD7VK6pbkdU_GXG7arNRqgBWrmeOvDhXAjEmpPjRL4r3ANM70PIxuxUS4ZHiSce/s16000/Legion%20Remix%20XP%20buff%20on%20a%20new%20alt.jpg" /></a></div>Things that are new are "heroic world tier" and obelisks, which are basically temporary power-ups that sometimes appear after you kill things in the open world. The latter led to one of my most memorable Remix experiences so far as it turns out there\'s at least one type of obelisk that doesn\'t actually power you up but summons a doomguard instead that you have to fight.

As mentioned in <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-state-of-my-wow-ing.html">a previous post</a>, I wasn\'t quite sure what to expect - while I enjoyed MoP Remix, the news I\'d seen coming out of the PTR about this new installment didn\'t sound particularly encouraging, and unlike many, I don\'t have any nostalgia for Legion since I wasn\'t subscribed for that expansion. I only experienced its story for the first time <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2021/10/more-on-legion.html">about four years ago</a>, when the husband and I levelled a pair of demon hunters through Legion Chromie Time, and while I came away with a vague feeling of "I can see why people enjoyed this at the time", it\'s not the same thing as when you were there yourself.</p><p>Anyway, last week "Lemix" finally arrived, and it\'s been pretty fun! In a departure from our usual tendency to roll tank/healer duos, and considering how superfluous I\'d ended up feeling as a healer in MoP Remix, I created a Kul Tiran blood death knight as my first character, and my husband accompanied me as a gnome warlock. I\'d forgotten just how fast you fly through the levels in Remix, and we levelled this first set of characters all the way to the cap right there on that first weekend.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3ws4vRlhA5nhKxPsqKNvLYgBhL1c8j3vI88nYIvSOfvKpRNErc099ikoGdEUlsM0faUxNmZUpn74qrlTjBfllDm3d0HZdq-74abDnJL0Tz2U9wOxZLB4e7cjxqE77f4-SMFSkw6C4G_Lk-KSCpuDeLfVLB7MhfNGH1y5GWtt8AaB6vhAtZqcHvMKXBo-V/s1673/Kinta%20and%20Wopek.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Kul Tiran death knight sitting down at Krasus\' Landing to be face to face with a male gnome" border="0" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3ws4vRlhA5nhKxPsqKNvLYgBhL1c8j3vI88nYIvSOfvKpRNErc099ikoGdEUlsM0faUxNmZUpn74qrlTjBfllDm3d0HZdq-74abDnJL0Tz2U9wOxZLB4e7cjxqE77f4-SMFSkw6C4G_Lk-KSCpuDeLfVLB7MhfNGH1y5GWtt8AaB6vhAtZqcHvMKXBo-V/w400-h200/Kinta%20and%20Wopek.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><i>When you have to sit down to be at eye level with your spouse.&nbsp;</i></p><p>I will say that I was also reminded of some of the things that I <i>didn\'t</i> like about the last Remix at the beginning - the sheer speed of progression is extremely good at/bad for making you feel larger than usual levels of FOMO, because you log in for the first time on day three and people who\'ve had nothing else to do during that time are already running around one-shotting everything, making you feel like you\'re hopelessly behind and will never catch up. But of course that\'s not true - progression is very quick for <i>everyone</i>; I just can\'t deny that it\'s a bit intimidating at first. Never mind the prompt on the character selection screen that constantly tells you that there are only X days left in Remix.</p><p>I\'d also forgotten about my ambiguous relationship with the dungeon rushing meta. Sometimes it\'s funny to zone in and see some demon hunter just zoom ahead and kill everything before you can even get anywhere close. Other times though it just feels tedious to spend the whole dungeon jogging after someone else, unable to actually contribute anything and possibly not even getting any loot (the Postmaster will only recover certain types of items). It just requires a certain mental adjustment that whenever I zone into a pug instance, I can\'t expect to have much fun and have to accept that I\'m just gonna be in and out to get something specific done/get my participation medal.</p><p>(The glorious exception to this that actually made me squee with delight was the Court of Stars run in which I was the one to successfully identify the spy at the end. People have explained to me in the past how that puzzle works, and I figured I\'d understood it, but in practice I\'d just never been the first one to find and talk to the right NPC. Actually having that honour for the first time felt weirdly validating and exciting.)</p><p>Anyway, I\'d like to talk a bit about what\'s the same and what\'s different in Legion Remix compared to the MoP variant.</p><p>Lore-wise, the Infinite Dragonflight is experimenting again and we\'re time-travelling to help them out. I think the quest writers must have had a lot of fun coming up with explanations for certain mechanical changes that poke fun at the game while also making a weird kind of sense in-universe. Legion is one of those expansions where everyone addresses you as "champion" because the presumption was that your character would\'ve levelled through the five previous expansions and defeated all kinds of potential world-ending threats. How do you reconcile that with dropping a freshly created level 10 into the storyline at this point? Your Infinite Dragonflight companion has answers:</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN3E3tkyryxgNE75BIIhHkSPN1xht8HNTczxYtRybh8XX26mpqB7KUhWfjWxyjuh9FClMONWLgZoGZe7M4mcITRCUMvXDPkKeLqSrVEgFy7Tfp9wdx3aHet3PwdgEmt6NFuikxvq27CdCLVdt9Mja3N6VWxRVdek2IgtI9UIeyLWbhRlnZav-58OFzJwfv/s655/Moratari%20explains%20your%20amnesia.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A WoW &quot;talking head&quot; quest pop-up.

So, we have to be wise about how we spend our time." And then the quest just auto-completes. Considering they included these kinds of mobile-style waiting games in four expansions until they eventually left them behind with Shadowlands, it just cracked me up to have your in-game guide effectively admit that these systems are a waste of time, never mind.</p><p>Gear-scrapping and Bronze dropping as a currency everywhere are back, though the latter can no longer be used to increase your item level and <i>only</i> serves as currency to buy cosmetics this time, something that many people requested after the last Remix. I\'m actually not sure how the gearing up works this time around. I tried to read up on it but found even the guides a bit unclear. It doesn\'t seem to matter though as simply doing various bits of content every so often rewards me with gear boxes that increase my item level ever so slightly, so I guess I\'ll just keep doing that and maybe it\'ll become more clear over time.</p><p>Instead of a magic cloak that constantly increases in power, we got the Legion artifact weapons growing with us this time. This generally seems to work well, except (in my opinion) for the missions to acquire the artifact weapons for your other specs, as these force you to respec and unequip your current artifact, making you feel terribly weak for the duration of those quests. There\'s also no power transfer to alts this time around, not even a little bit, with the exception of the event\'s XP bonus.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh48AE3zo6xUGfjslSGI0RhqVKqQgoBj68oioS3gWMmR0jAROj3wwouTVSEYnRbPGbxvy75qpCX-P4DHf_vrmc3TfOi89ZWu5Fzon5XWBnJP8zS2WGUPYb4bGx9vmmTrTD7VK6pbkdU_GXG7arNRqgBWrmeOvDhXAjEmpPjRL4r3ANM70PIxuxUS4ZHiSce/s221/Legion%20Remix%20XP%20buff%20on%20a%20new%20alt.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The tooltip for &quot;Infinite Power&quot; shows that my alt has +83% experience gain but only +1 stamina." border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh48AE3zo6xUGfjslSGI0RhqVKqQgoBj68oioS3gWMmR0jAROj3wwouTVSEYnRbPGbxvy75qpCX-P4DHf_vrmc3TfOi89ZWu5Fzon5XWBnJP8zS2WGUPYb4bGx9vmmTrTD7VK6pbkdU_GXG7arNRqgBWrmeOvDhXAjEmpPjRL4r3ANM70PIxuxUS4ZHiSce/s16000/Legion%20Remix%20XP%20buff%20on%20a%20new%20alt.jpg" /></a></div>Things that are new are "heroic world tier" and obelisks, which are basically temporary power-ups that sometimes appear after you kill things in the open world.

However, design-wise it\'s got more in common with the more northern Tol Barad, in the sense that both are fairly dreary islands full of ruins and ghosts. That\'s not to say that Balor is Turtle WoW\'s version of Tol Barad though - reading around a bit, I found out that the inspiration for it actually came from the <a href="https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness_manual#Map_of_Azeroth" target="_blank">map of Azeroth in the Warcraft II manual</a>.

Some liked it, but a common criticism was that the quests required too much running around, or even swimming. The latter would then usually lead to someone pointing out that there\'s a vendor offering swim speed potions, which should alleviate that particular issue. I\'m glad I knew about this going in, though I\'ll say right off the bat that I don\'t think the swim speed potions were <i>that</i> much of a&nbsp;help, at least not the first time around. They seem to count as conjured items specific to the zone or something, so you can\'t stock up on them if you ever plan to hearth out, as they\'ll just vanish the moment you do that. They also last only five minutes, which is fine if you <i>know</i> that you need to swim from one end to the island to the other with no interruptions, but in the early stages where you might pause at various points to pick up quests or just explore, you\'ll just end up wasting a lot of the timer on the effect.</p><p>Anyway, let\'s back up for a moment: What <i>is</i> Balor? One of the quests in Northwind actually teaches you a lot of lore about the island if you pay attention. It\'s basically an off-shoot of Stormwind that got rich from the local gold mines, but then <i>something</i> bad happened there and we\'re not sure what. As Alliance you start on a little bit of rock off the main island, where SI:7 has erected a base, and from there you basically set out to explore.</p><p>The main island is indeed a royal pain to uncover, with steep cliffs all around so that you can only actually go inland at around four different points on the map. The actual land mass then follows a similar pattern of steep, winding paths that make you loop around a lot with minimal shortcuts. I can see why people would find that annoying, but I actually kind of loved it because it made the place a proper challenge to fully explore. Just when I thought I\'d already been absolutely everywhere, I made it to the very end of yet another narrow path to find a little camp with a dwarf and a night elf quest giver in it. It was delightful!</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwzoaKgRq0-uleQk0IZhewNSwYPQuA4dzhzX5C-XyRJZhU89IIZ8dUVzZ6MYVBz7wqHZPxXsNYUKK6ECq51r1Jd7Zm8A3xOw_PUwEBDliUK0ymoSWTjTurZyjPwwR0nuTxJZvRe3Ujuy_3j62oX5MSuTBnwqXIQPUu7EPYtSP2DLGv3eTyZ1Z7fzpYxtjR/s1920/Fishing%20on%20Balor.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female high elf fishes in a stagnant river on Balor, with a dead crocolisk, a wooden bridge and several trees visible nearby" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwzoaKgRq0-uleQk0IZhewNSwYPQuA4dzhzX5C-XyRJZhU89IIZ8dUVzZ6MYVBz7wqHZPxXsNYUKK6ECq51r1Jd7Zm8A3xOw_PUwEBDliUK0ymoSWTjTurZyjPwwR0nuTxJZvRe3Ujuy_3j62oX5MSuTBnwqXIQPUu7EPYtSP2DLGv3eTyZ1Z7fzpYxtjR/w400-h225/Fishing%20on%20Balor.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>(Side note, after being unable to fish in Northwind, I was also pleased to find that fishing worked in this zone, and there were plenty of pools to both level up my skill and add to my gold stockpile.)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Mind you, all this did make my first-time questing experience extremely slow and inefficient. For example I got sent into the exact same cave to kill the exact same demons twice in a row - if only I had known and had picked up both of those quests at the same time!

However, design-wise it\'s got more in common with the more northern Tol Barad, in the sense that both are fairly dreary islands full of ruins and ghosts. That\'s not to say that Balor is Turtle WoW\'s version of Tol Barad though - reading around a bit, I found out that the inspiration for it actually came from the <a href="https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness_manual#Map_of_Azeroth" target="_blank">map of Azeroth in the Warcraft II manual</a>.

Some liked it, but a common criticism was that the quests required too much running around, or even swimming. The latter would then usually lead to someone pointing out that there\'s a vendor offering swim speed potions, which should alleviate that particular issue. I\'m glad I knew about this going in, though I\'ll say right off the bat that I don\'t think the swim speed potions were <i>that</i> much of a&nbsp;help, at least not the first time around. They seem to count as conjured items specific to the zone or something, so you can\'t stock up on them if you ever plan to hearth out, as they\'ll just vanish the moment you do that. They also last only five minutes, which is fine if you <i>know</i> that you need to swim from one end to the island to the other with no interruptions, but in the early stages where you might pause at various points to pick up quests or just explore, you\'ll just end up wasting a lot of the timer on the effect.</p><p>Anyway, let\'s back up for a moment: What <i>is</i> Balor? One of the quests in Northwind actually teaches you a lot of lore about the island if you pay attention. It\'s basically an off-shoot of Stormwind that got rich from the local gold mines, but then <i>something</i> bad happened there and we\'re not sure what. As Alliance you start on a little bit of rock off the main island, where SI:7 has erected a base, and from there you basically set out to explore.</p><p>The main island is indeed a royal pain to uncover, with steep cliffs all around so that you can only actually go inland at around four different points on the map. The actual land mass then follows a similar pattern of steep, winding paths that make you loop around a lot with minimal shortcuts. I can see why people would find that annoying, but I actually kind of loved it because it made the place a proper challenge to fully explore. Just when I thought I\'d already been absolutely everywhere, I made it to the very end of yet another narrow path to find a little camp with a dwarf and a night elf quest giver in it. It was delightful!</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwzoaKgRq0-uleQk0IZhewNSwYPQuA4dzhzX5C-XyRJZhU89IIZ8dUVzZ6MYVBz7wqHZPxXsNYUKK6ECq51r1Jd7Zm8A3xOw_PUwEBDliUK0ymoSWTjTurZyjPwwR0nuTxJZvRe3Ujuy_3j62oX5MSuTBnwqXIQPUu7EPYtSP2DLGv3eTyZ1Z7fzpYxtjR/s1920/Fishing%20on%20Balor.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female high elf fishes in a stagnant river on Balor, with a dead crocolisk, a wooden bridge and several trees visible nearby" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwzoaKgRq0-uleQk0IZhewNSwYPQuA4dzhzX5C-XyRJZhU89IIZ8dUVzZ6MYVBz7wqHZPxXsNYUKK6ECq51r1Jd7Zm8A3xOw_PUwEBDliUK0ymoSWTjTurZyjPwwR0nuTxJZvRe3Ujuy_3j62oX5MSuTBnwqXIQPUu7EPYtSP2DLGv3eTyZ1Z7fzpYxtjR/w400-h225/Fishing%20on%20Balor.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>(Side note, after being unable to fish in Northwind, I was also pleased to find that fishing worked in this zone, and there were plenty of pools to both level up my skill and add to my gold stockpile.)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Mind you, all this did make my first-time questing experience extremely slow and inefficient.

I made a point of going there in the official game to take a screenshot for comparison purposes, and it\'s literally a huge swathe of boring mountainside separated only by a small nondescript sea inlet.<p></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfB6Cqy32bXKIr9zPR9TtVsZ-vIeJuH7Q7tE8iUERnG2eXBks2XVKZLRSHv8lOuVzjtql32GXOT-dQFPPUQeg-4EuPpekvBVYwCael1H0m1EQovvaFcYKE-nQ3bRGtyT3CUkONUcVWfRnEZ96Ds8M7o3ro0KnZ9f6dYRlLiDR8mkRu8DuOdOsGCVlQZ7x9/s1920/The%20gap%20between%20Stormwind%20and%20Dun%20Morogh.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The mountains north of Stormwind and the mountains south of Dun Morogh, separated by a sea inlet after the Cataclysm" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfB6Cqy32bXKIr9zPR9TtVsZ-vIeJuH7Q7tE8iUERnG2eXBks2XVKZLRSHv8lOuVzjtql32GXOT-dQFPPUQeg-4EuPpekvBVYwCael1H0m1EQovvaFcYKE-nQ3bRGtyT3CUkONUcVWfRnEZ96Ds8M7o3ro0KnZ9f6dYRlLiDR8mkRu8DuOdOsGCVlQZ7x9/w400-h225/The%20gap%20between%20Stormwind%20and%20Dun%20Morogh.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Though taking this screenshot at sunset did manage to make it look a lot better than it really is.</i></p><p>Northwind on Turtle WoW has a lot more interesting things going on. My description above is a bit of an oversimplification, as there\'s also a jousting tournament area and a quarry with Dark Iron dwarves for example. But the general vibe is definitely very similar to Elwynn: a lush forest dotted with human settlements and populated by bears, wolves and boars.</p><p>Weirdly, this was another thing that once again made me appreciate Blizzard\'s artists more because even after ten expansions of adding new terrain, they are still very good at making each zone visually distinctive with new assets and different creative directions. (That\'s why <a href="https://www.whereinwarcraft.net/" target="_blank">WoW GeoGuessr</a> is so much fun!) Even if some zones obviously have similarities at this point, I don\'t think the Blizz devs have ever created a zone that\'s as obviously just a derivative of another zone the way Northwind is of Elwynn Forest.</p><p>That said, obviously part of Turtle WoW\'s charm is that everything they add is "more of the same" in a way, and I thought the zone was very beautiful and enjoyable to quest in. (It <i>does</i> have unique music too.) I did particularly enjoy the thought put into the lore and how a zone in that location would connect to everything around it.</p><p>My favourite bit was probably this mini garden/nook (there\'s probably a better English word for this that I\'m not aware of) that featured a statue of <a href="https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Tiffin_Ellerian_Wrynn">Tiffin Wrynn</a> and has you meeting her elderly mother, who still grieves for her daughter and asks you to carry a gift for Anduin to Stormwind Keep as she\'s not allowed to see her grandson. That hit kind of hard for me because Queen Tiffin is such a minor character in Warcraft lore, seemingly only created in order to die and give Varian something to brood over, it had never even occurred to me that she should probably have some other surviving family members, or to wonder how they might relate to Anduin.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhHwW9WG9yyHHIRccKWMDrla2IJGgh-rDLId8buwad1dVPi2BhSaKrbODZkffN6MLFMnF7dLRWPMRJgoG-RM6m6LcVl0NHhOKh2o3pPTZ-HYnGJOrOq_8AbDcam8AjEAZmGz4X-NvJnR3QVzIMRSVPDhtVSBhcPDqt9NULEuUvnCexGH4dx3AnbjhRymak/s1920/Statue%20of%20Tiffin%20in%20Ambershire.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Ingvild Ellerian awaits the player\'s return next to a statue of her late daughter Tiffin in Ambershire" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhHwW9WG9yyHHIRccKWMDrla2IJGgh-rDLId8buwad1dVPi2BhSaKrbODZkffN6MLFMnF7dLRWPMRJgoG-RM6m6LcVl0NHhOKh2o3pPTZ-HYnGJOrOq_8AbDcam8AjEAZmGz4X-NvJnR3QVzIMRSVPDhtVSBhcPDqt9NULEuUvnCexGH4dx3AnbjhRymak/w400-h225/Statue%20of%20Tiffin%20in%20Ambershire.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>A lot of non-quest NPCs also offer additional chat options to flesh out their characters and paint a richer picture of the zone, and I thought the whole thing felt significantly more coherent than the Thalassian Highlands.</p><p>As for some negatives: Why are all the boars aggressive? Boars are usually neutral mobs in WoW unless they are corrupted or diseased, but for some reason all the boars in this forest hate people and other animals, and you\'ll soon learn to loathe the sound of their angry squeals as you get attacked by one for the 50th time while just trying to pass through. I\'ve seen people meme about this in general chat too, so I know it\'s not just me.</p><p>The bodies of water in the zone are clearly unfinished in some way, because when you dive into one... you don\'t get a breath bar! It\'s apparently a magical forest where everyone can just breathe underwater. Also, while they actually remembered to add fishing pools here (unlike in Thalassian Highlands), you still can\'t fish - or at least I couldn\'t, as I\'d just get an error whenever I tried.</p><p>The worst part of it all though was undoubtedly the Dark Iron quarry in the north-eastern corner. I don\'t know what they screwed up there with the terrain building, but I struggled with mobs evading, falling through the floor, attacking through walls and the like repeatedly, to the point that it made the whole place a royal pain in the arse to quest in.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJIf8xqrzf3Dg7hxsKlnng6Kjiot9hUav-eQaX5u3h6jkCiUpU0tMBqffw_fp5tH4YO2ypbSfy-9_169DwOqpMiuvM3tXpwMIbweevWNtaP-KGl-2eKRBDbT3Th_RKLVVAK04L1J-Y-UgvnrHsTOoyk2IpgbwzzbdbIiASNem1J7HGbyw9AKXoK0gNsf1i/s1437/Northwind%20map.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A map of the Northwind zone in Turtle WoW, showing the town of Ambershire, Sherwood Quarry and other points of interest" border="0" height="301" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJIf8xqrzf3Dg7hxsKlnng6Kjiot9hUav-eQaX5u3h6jkCiUpU0tMBqffw_fp5tH4YO2ypbSfy-9_169DwOqpMiuvM3tXpwMIbweevWNtaP-KGl-2eKRBDbT3Th_RKLVVAK04L1J-Y-UgvnrHsTOoyk2IpgbwzzbdbIiASNem1J7HGbyw9AKXoK0gNsf1i/w400-h301/Northwind%20map.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Another problem I had was that one quest I had in that area was just to search the quarry and return with anything useful I find, with no further details. At first I thought that I\'d be looking for a piece of parchment on a table or something, but after searching the whole area and coming away empty I resigned myself to looking it up outside the game. I found that I was actually looking for a drop from an "Overseer Bragordi", which it turns out I had never come across because she was basically constantly dead.

I do think the location for this zone is an excellent choice as that whole area is basically a big chunk of nothing on the post-Cataclysm version of the Eastern Kingdoms map. I made a point of going there in the official game to take a screenshot for comparison purposes, and it\'s literally a huge swathe of boring mountainside separated only by a small nondescript sea inlet.<p></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfB6Cqy32bXKIr9zPR9TtVsZ-vIeJuH7Q7tE8iUERnG2eXBks2XVKZLRSHv8lOuVzjtql32GXOT-dQFPPUQeg-4EuPpekvBVYwCael1H0m1EQovvaFcYKE-nQ3bRGtyT3CUkONUcVWfRnEZ96Ds8M7o3ro0KnZ9f6dYRlLiDR8mkRu8DuOdOsGCVlQZ7x9/s1920/The%20gap%20between%20Stormwind%20and%20Dun%20Morogh.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The mountains north of Stormwind and the mountains south of Dun Morogh, separated by a sea inlet after the Cataclysm" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfB6Cqy32bXKIr9zPR9TtVsZ-vIeJuH7Q7tE8iUERnG2eXBks2XVKZLRSHv8lOuVzjtql32GXOT-dQFPPUQeg-4EuPpekvBVYwCael1H0m1EQovvaFcYKE-nQ3bRGtyT3CUkONUcVWfRnEZ96Ds8M7o3ro0KnZ9f6dYRlLiDR8mkRu8DuOdOsGCVlQZ7x9/w400-h225/The%20gap%20between%20Stormwind%20and%20Dun%20Morogh.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Though taking this screenshot at sunset did manage to make it look a lot better than it really is.</i></p><p>Northwind on Turtle WoW has a lot more interesting things going on. My description above is a bit of an oversimplification, as there\'s also a jousting tournament area and a quarry with Dark Iron dwarves for example. But the general vibe is definitely very similar to Elwynn: a lush forest dotted with human settlements and populated by bears, wolves and boars.</p><p>Weirdly, this was another thing that once again made me appreciate Blizzard\'s artists more because even after ten expansions of adding new terrain, they are still very good at making each zone visually distinctive with new assets and different creative directions. (That\'s why <a href="https://www.whereinwarcraft.net/" target="_blank">WoW GeoGuessr</a> is so much fun!) Even if some zones obviously have similarities at this point, I don\'t think the Blizz devs have ever created a zone that\'s as obviously just a derivative of another zone the way Northwind is of Elwynn Forest.</p><p>That said, obviously part of Turtle WoW\'s charm is that everything they add is "more of the same" in a way, and I thought the zone was very beautiful and enjoyable to quest in. (It <i>does</i> have unique music too.) I did particularly enjoy the thought put into the lore and how a zone in that location would connect to everything around it.</p><p>My favourite bit was probably this mini garden/nook (there\'s probably a better English word for this that I\'m not aware of) that featured a statue of <a href="https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Tiffin_Ellerian_Wrynn">Tiffin Wrynn</a> and has you meeting her elderly mother, who still grieves for her daughter and asks you to carry a gift for Anduin to Stormwind Keep as she\'s not allowed to see her grandson. That hit kind of hard for me because Queen Tiffin is such a minor character in Warcraft lore, seemingly only created in order to die and give Varian something to brood over, it had never even occurred to me that she should probably have some other surviving family members, or to wonder how they might relate to Anduin.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhHwW9WG9yyHHIRccKWMDrla2IJGgh-rDLId8buwad1dVPi2BhSaKrbODZkffN6MLFMnF7dLRWPMRJgoG-RM6m6LcVl0NHhOKh2o3pPTZ-HYnGJOrOq_8AbDcam8AjEAZmGz4X-NvJnR3QVzIMRSVPDhtVSBhcPDqt9NULEuUvnCexGH4dx3AnbjhRymak/s1920/Statue%20of%20Tiffin%20in%20Ambershire.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Ingvild Ellerian awaits the player\'s return next to a statue of her late daughter Tiffin in Ambershire" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhHwW9WG9yyHHIRccKWMDrla2IJGgh-rDLId8buwad1dVPi2BhSaKrbODZkffN6MLFMnF7dLRWPMRJgoG-RM6m6LcVl0NHhOKh2o3pPTZ-HYnGJOrOq_8AbDcam8AjEAZmGz4X-NvJnR3QVzIMRSVPDhtVSBhcPDqt9NULEuUvnCexGH4dx3AnbjhRymak/w400-h225/Statue%20of%20Tiffin%20in%20Ambershire.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>A lot of non-quest NPCs also offer additional chat options to flesh out their characters and paint a richer picture of the zone, and I thought the whole thing felt significantly more coherent than the Thalassian Highlands.</p><p>As for some negatives: Why are all the boars aggressive? Boars are usually neutral mobs in WoW unless they are corrupted or diseased, but for some reason all the boars in this forest hate people and other animals, and you\'ll soon learn to loathe the sound of their angry squeals as you get attacked by one for the 50th time while just trying to pass through. I\'ve seen people meme about this in general chat too, so I know it\'s not just me.</p><p>The bodies of water in the zone are clearly unfinished in some way, because when you dive into one... you don\'t get a breath bar! It\'s apparently a magical forest where everyone can just breathe underwater. Also, while they actually remembered to add fishing pools here (unlike in Thalassian Highlands), you still can\'t fish - or at least I couldn\'t, as I\'d just get an error whenever I tried.</p><p>The worst part of it all though was undoubtedly the Dark Iron quarry in the north-eastern corner. I don\'t know what they screwed up there with the terrain building, but I struggled with mobs evading, falling through the floor, attacking through walls and the like repeatedly, to the point that it made the whole place a royal pain in the arse to quest in.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJIf8xqrzf3Dg7hxsKlnng6Kjiot9hUav-eQaX5u3h6jkCiUpU0tMBqffw_fp5tH4YO2ypbSfy-9_169DwOqpMiuvM3tXpwMIbweevWNtaP-KGl-2eKRBDbT3Th_RKLVVAK04L1J-Y-UgvnrHsTOoyk2IpgbwzzbdbIiASNem1J7HGbyw9AKXoK0gNsf1i/s1437/Northwind%20map.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A map of the Northwind zone in Turtle WoW, showing the town of Ambershire, Sherwood Quarry and other points of interest" border="0" height="301" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJIf8xqrzf3Dg7hxsKlnng6Kjiot9hUav-eQaX5u3h6jkCiUpU0tMBqffw_fp5tH4YO2ypbSfy-9_169DwOqpMiuvM3tXpwMIbweevWNtaP-KGl-2eKRBDbT3Th_RKLVVAK04L1J-Y-UgvnrHsTOoyk2IpgbwzzbdbIiASNem1J7HGbyw9AKXoK0gNsf1i/w400-h301/Northwind%20map.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Another problem I had was that one quest I had in that area was just to search the quarry and return with anything useful I find, with no further details. At first I thought that I\'d be looking for a piece of parchment on a table or something, but after searching the whole area and coming away empty I resigned myself to looking it up outside the game. I found that I was actually looking for a drop from an "Overseer Bragordi", which it turns out I had never come across because she was basically constantly dead.

Not enjoying retail? Well, Classic\'s right there and could still be earning your sub! Love the original world of Azeroth but Classic is just a bit too same-old, same-old for you at this point? Here\'s Season of Discovery! And so on and so forth.</p><p>I\'m going to neither agree nor disagree with that statement, but I\'ll say that the multiple versions of WoW thing has definitely worked out well for me in terms of getting value out of my subscription, as I\'ve at least <i>tried</i> almost every mode that the dev team has come out with and I tend to enjoy playing more than one of them at a time. Sadly (to me), it often seems that I\'m in a minority in that regard, with most players that I talk to just sticking to the one version they prefer and perhaps even actively disliking the other versions of the game.</p><p>I\'ve been wondering what this means for this blog, because I imagine that if readers just want to read about their favourite version of WoW, me switching back and forth between talking about very different things seemingly at random might be perceived as annoying. I\'ll still write what I want to write, but I thought it might also be useful and interesting to give a general update on where I\'m at with each version of WoW at the moment, so you know what to expect if there\'s one specific mode you\'re waiting to hear about.</p><p><b>Retail (The War Within)</b></p><p>I\'m currently doing four delves a week with the husband but to be honest not much else. K\'aresh has been entertaining enough - I rescued all the wee animals and so on and so forth, but it doesn\'t have the same staying power for me as the final zones of the last two expansions had. Patch 11.2 also killed my desire to play alts temporarily as it broke the Altoholic addon, and the bank restructuring made all my alts\' banks a horrible mess. Altoholic works again now, but those banks are still in chaos and I just can\'t bear to look at them much, so my alts have mostly remained unplayed.</p><p>I\'m generally feeling a degree of end-of-expansion ennui, which feels a bit weird to say when Midnight is still more than half a year away, but it is what it is. I don\'t feel like there\'s much to look forward to before then. I do have a few goals I want to achieve before the expansion ends, such as throwing myself against ?? difficulty Ky\'veza and seeing all of Manaforge Omega on LFR, but none of these things feel particularly urgent at this point.</p><p>Admittedly Legion Remix is coming out in a few days, but I\'m not actually sure how I invested I want to be in that either. I was quite looking forward to it initially (after <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/08/mop-remix-retrospective.html">how much fun I ended up having in MoP Remix</a>), but from everything I\'ve heard since then, the Legion version is actually going to be quite different and I\'m not sure whether all those changes will be good or bad for me. I\'ll still check it out and will probably get a few posts out of it, but I\'m currently not actively hyped for it.</p><p><b>Mists of Pandaria Classic</b></p><p>My "<a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/06/checking-in-on-cataclysm-classic.html">Project Vale of Eternal Blossoms</a>" has kind of stalled because <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/08/struggling-to-enjoy-journey-in-mop.html">I just couldn\'t bear levelling from 84 to 85</a>. Fortunately this one isn\'t something that needs to be rushed, as I should still have several months to complete my goal (until Garrosh destroys the Vale in Classic too). I expect that I\'ll still get back to it in time before then, though I still have no plans to do anything else in MoP Classic.</p><p><b>Season of Discovery</b></p><p>SoD has sadly become another abandoned project. Remember, <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/11/a-return-to-season-of-discovery.html">I wanted to level up so I could see the actual new dungeon Blizzard had added to it</a> (Demon Fall Canyon). However, <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/02/so-incursions.html">Incursions</a> apparently managed to completely sap my will to play. It\'s kind of weird actually, but I really did not deal well with the way they required you to completely clear out your quest log. It made me realise that I really rely on those random breadcrumb quests to give me direction. Even if I technically know in my head which zones to go to for quests at level 45 for example, having to make a choice with no quest guidance whatsoever was weirdly deflating.</p><p>I do remember that I actually got to Searing Gorge and was kind of fascinated by the new Blackrock Eruption event there, but unfortunately this was also when my OP raid gear from BFD in phase one was starting to no longer be <i>quite</i> so good, and questing was starting to feel like a bit of a drag. At some point I just stopped logging in.</p><p>While I wasn\'t playing, the devs actually added a second new dungeon (Karazhan Crypts) and an actual new raid (Scarlet Enclave), followed by an announcement that they\'re stopping development on SoD but also not shutting it down. It\'s been sitting in this weird limbo state ever since where it\'s technically still there and has some people playing, but much of the community considers it dead because new content is no longer being added. (The server selection screen has the largest Europen PvE server listed as low pop at this point, and according to <a href="https://ironforge.pro/population/sod/" target="_blank">Ironforge.pro stats</a>, the number of people still raiding there is about half of what it is on Classic era.)</p><p>Assuming SoD does continue to hang around, I expect I will get back to it eventually to check out more of the stuff I missed, but there\'s also a chance that I won\'t.</p><p><b>Classic era</b></p><p>I\'ve mentioned before that while I love Classic era, I\'ve seen so much of it as this point that <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/10/why-im-not-playing-as-much-classic.html">the novelty has kind of worn off</a>.

I\'m sure the lawsuit has been great advertising for them over the past few weeks, bringing in a lot of new business for the time being.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>I sometimes hear people say that WoW is in a better state than ever because of how many different ways to play it there are nowadays. Not enjoying retail? Well, Classic\'s right there and could still be earning your sub! Love the original world of Azeroth but Classic is just a bit too same-old, same-old for you at this point? Here\'s Season of Discovery! And so on and so forth.</p><p>I\'m going to neither agree nor disagree with that statement, but I\'ll say that the multiple versions of WoW thing has definitely worked out well for me in terms of getting value out of my subscription, as I\'ve at least <i>tried</i> almost every mode that the dev team has come out with and I tend to enjoy playing more than one of them at a time. Sadly (to me), it often seems that I\'m in a minority in that regard, with most players that I talk to just sticking to the one version they prefer and perhaps even actively disliking the other versions of the game.</p><p>I\'ve been wondering what this means for this blog, because I imagine that if readers just want to read about their favourite version of WoW, me switching back and forth between talking about very different things seemingly at random might be perceived as annoying. I\'ll still write what I want to write, but I thought it might also be useful and interesting to give a general update on where I\'m at with each version of WoW at the moment, so you know what to expect if there\'s one specific mode you\'re waiting to hear about.</p><p><b>Retail (The War Within)</b></p><p>I\'m currently doing four delves a week with the husband but to be honest not much else. K\'aresh has been entertaining enough - I rescued all the wee animals and so on and so forth, but it doesn\'t have the same staying power for me as the final zones of the last two expansions had. Patch 11.2 also killed my desire to play alts temporarily as it broke the Altoholic addon, and the bank restructuring made all my alts\' banks a horrible mess. Altoholic works again now, but those banks are still in chaos and I just can\'t bear to look at them much, so my alts have mostly remained unplayed.</p><p>I\'m generally feeling a degree of end-of-expansion ennui, which feels a bit weird to say when Midnight is still more than half a year away, but it is what it is. I don\'t feel like there\'s much to look forward to before then. I do have a few goals I want to achieve before the expansion ends, such as throwing myself against ?? difficulty Ky\'veza and seeing all of Manaforge Omega on LFR, but none of these things feel particularly urgent at this point.</p><p>Admittedly Legion Remix is coming out in a few days, but I\'m not actually sure how I invested I want to be in that either. I was quite looking forward to it initially (after <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/08/mop-remix-retrospective.html">how much fun I ended up having in MoP Remix</a>), but from everything I\'ve heard since then, the Legion version is actually going to be quite different and I\'m not sure whether all those changes will be good or bad for me. I\'ll still check it out and will probably get a few posts out of it, but I\'m currently not actively hyped for it.</p><p><b>Mists of Pandaria Classic</b></p><p>My "<a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/06/checking-in-on-cataclysm-classic.html">Project Vale of Eternal Blossoms</a>" has kind of stalled because <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/08/struggling-to-enjoy-journey-in-mop.html">I just couldn\'t bear levelling from 84 to 85</a>. Fortunately this one isn\'t something that needs to be rushed, as I should still have several months to complete my goal (until Garrosh destroys the Vale in Classic too). I expect that I\'ll still get back to it in time before then, though I still have no plans to do anything else in MoP Classic.</p><p><b>Season of Discovery</b></p><p>SoD has sadly become another abandoned project. Remember, <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/11/a-return-to-season-of-discovery.html">I wanted to level up so I could see the actual new dungeon Blizzard had added to it</a> (Demon Fall Canyon). However, <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/02/so-incursions.html">Incursions</a> apparently managed to completely sap my will to play. It\'s kind of weird actually, but I really did not deal well with the way they required you to completely clear out your quest log. It made me realise that I really rely on those random breadcrumb quests to give me direction. Even if I technically know in my head which zones to go to for quests at level 45 for example, having to make a choice with no quest guidance whatsoever was weirdly deflating.</p><p>I do remember that I actually got to Searing Gorge and was kind of fascinated by the new Blackrock Eruption event there, but unfortunately this was also when my OP raid gear from BFD in phase one was starting to no longer be <i>quite</i> so good, and questing was starting to feel like a bit of a drag. At some point I just stopped logging in.</p><p>While I wasn\'t playing, the devs actually added a second new dungeon (Karazhan Crypts) and an actual new raid (Scarlet Enclave), followed by an announcement that they\'re stopping development on SoD but also not shutting it down. It\'s been sitting in this weird limbo state ever since where it\'s technically still there and has some people playing, but much of the community considers it dead because new content is no longer being added. (The server selection screen has the largest Europen PvE server listed as low pop at this point, and according to <a href="https://ironforge.pro/population/sod/" target="_blank">Ironforge.pro stats</a>, the number of people still raiding there is about half of what it is on Classic era.)</p><p>Assuming SoD does continue to hang around, I expect I will get back to it eventually to check out more of the stuff I missed, but there\'s also a chance that I won\'t.</p><p><b>Classic era</b></p><p>I\'ve mentioned before that while I love Classic era, I\'ve seen so much of it as this point that <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/10/why-im-not-playing-as-much-classic.html">the novelty has kind of worn off</a>. I still log in almost every day to do things like create <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=14342/mooncloth">Mooncloth</a> or put items on the auction house - to what purpose, I\'m honestly not sure. I guess since the population on era is not that large (especially since the anniversary servers went live), I feel like I\'m still making a small contribution to the server community by keeping the auction house stocked. I\'m also still keeping an eye on my guild\'s Discord even if I don\'t have anything of my own to add.</p><p>I currently find it difficult to imagine a scenario in which I\'d go back to playing era as my primary mode of Classic, though I guess you should never say never. It seems more likely to me that one day I will finally tire of just logging in for cooldowns and auction house business and that will be it for me then.

I guess it felt more disruptive in the Deadmines, which I\'ve run so many times that I\'m very familiar with what to expect.

(They also had voice lines, and one orc in particular had such an over-the-top death gurgle, it made me laugh out loud.) The biggest challenge was usually just to get to the boss without accidentally pulling additional trash, and honestly that\'s kind of how I feel like it should be in a Vanilla environment. I don\'t know why the Blizzard devs seemed so enamoured with stuffing the updated fights in Season of Discovery with extra mechanics (which were usually still too boring for retail raiders, but disproportionally demanding compared to Vanilla content).&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of just getting to each boss though, another thing that was interesting was that the last two bosses were hidden behind a locked gate, and to unlock it you needed to create a key from two fragments found within a dungeon. One can be looted from a chest and the other is a guaranteed green drop from one of the earlier bosses. In my first run, everyone greeded on the green drop but we didn\'t keep track of who won it, and when we got to the gate, everyone insisted that <i>they</i> hadn\'t been the one who won the item. This meant we had to abandon the dungeon at that point as we couldn\'t proceed to the last two bosses.</p><p>I initially thought that perhaps this key was a temporary item that you had to assemble every run, kind of like the head on a pike in Lower Blackrock Spire, but later I learned that no, it actually translates into a permanent key, as on my second run the tank already had it and told us not to worry about the drops, which I thought was interesting. The key fragments also don\'t bind and can be bought and sold on the auction house, though you need to be inside the dungeon to assemble them.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA12Dh6IbG_3pLKMezPQSETL_loNvsRLQp76yw9wK5-7VV_uEyjLBvIY3sI-ljcmOEMkbqUSXhvuQlI1CHE5_XKzsOACqi-0FDkmCiIR6ykdv-NXHmyqra6E5AGYuKgcFnwMYWTHdaFZpF5oQvZHZLzM2GF58dt_9EJc8TYl6lg7P4twQ0KACpKCtaq7Ok/s1920/Coming%20up%20to%20the%20dragon%20boss%20in%20Dragonmaw%20Retreat.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A pug group carefully navigates the hallway containing the dragon boss in Dragonmaw Retreat" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA12Dh6IbG_3pLKMezPQSETL_loNvsRLQp76yw9wK5-7VV_uEyjLBvIY3sI-ljcmOEMkbqUSXhvuQlI1CHE5_XKzsOACqi-0FDkmCiIR6ykdv-NXHmyqra6E5AGYuKgcFnwMYWTHdaFZpF5oQvZHZLzM2GF58dt_9EJc8TYl6lg7P4twQ0KACpKCtaq7Ok/w400-h225/Coming%20up%20to%20the%20dragon%20boss%20in%20Dragonmaw%20Retreat.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The last bit of the dungeon hidden behind that gate was definitely the most interesting and impressive part of the experience, as you end up in this giant hallway in which a corrupted red dragon patrols, and you need to sneak around and kill six enchanters around the room to bring down his 95% damage reduction shield. That <i>definitely</i> felt very vanilla.</p><p>The very last boss turned out to be Zuluhed the Whacked, which made me go "oh, I know this guy", though it took me a moment to recall that in official WoW lore, this particular orc leader went to Outland and enslaved the Netherwing there. Not sure it\'s an upgrade for him to become a mid-level dungeon end boss instead, but it was a cool reveal nonetheless.</p><p>Also, shoutout to Hoodedmon the troll shaman, who was our tank on the second run and did a bang-up job both with the tanking itself as well as providing general leadership and explanations of what to do.

The biggest challenge was usually just to get to the boss without accidentally pulling additional trash, and honestly that\'s kind of how I feel like it should be in a Vanilla environment. I don\'t know why the Blizzard devs seemed so enamoured with stuffing the updated fights in Season of Discovery with extra mechanics (which were usually still too boring for retail raiders, but disproportionally demanding compared to Vanilla content).&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of just getting to each boss though, another thing that was interesting was that the last two bosses were hidden behind a locked gate, and to unlock it you needed to create a key from two fragments found within a dungeon. One can be looted from a chest and the other is a guaranteed green drop from one of the earlier bosses. In my first run, everyone greeded on the green drop but we didn\'t keep track of who won it, and when we got to the gate, everyone insisted that <i>they</i> hadn\'t been the one who won the item. This meant we had to abandon the dungeon at that point as we couldn\'t proceed to the last two bosses.</p><p>I initially thought that perhaps this key was a temporary item that you had to assemble every run, kind of like the head on a pike in Lower Blackrock Spire, but later I learned that no, it actually translates into a permanent key, as on my second run the tank already had it and told us not to worry about the drops, which I thought was interesting. The key fragments also don\'t bind and can be bought and sold on the auction house, though you need to be inside the dungeon to assemble them.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA12Dh6IbG_3pLKMezPQSETL_loNvsRLQp76yw9wK5-7VV_uEyjLBvIY3sI-ljcmOEMkbqUSXhvuQlI1CHE5_XKzsOACqi-0FDkmCiIR6ykdv-NXHmyqra6E5AGYuKgcFnwMYWTHdaFZpF5oQvZHZLzM2GF58dt_9EJc8TYl6lg7P4twQ0KACpKCtaq7Ok/s1920/Coming%20up%20to%20the%20dragon%20boss%20in%20Dragonmaw%20Retreat.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A pug group carefully navigates the hallway containing the dragon boss in Dragonmaw Retreat" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA12Dh6IbG_3pLKMezPQSETL_loNvsRLQp76yw9wK5-7VV_uEyjLBvIY3sI-ljcmOEMkbqUSXhvuQlI1CHE5_XKzsOACqi-0FDkmCiIR6ykdv-NXHmyqra6E5AGYuKgcFnwMYWTHdaFZpF5oQvZHZLzM2GF58dt_9EJc8TYl6lg7P4twQ0KACpKCtaq7Ok/w400-h225/Coming%20up%20to%20the%20dragon%20boss%20in%20Dragonmaw%20Retreat.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The last bit of the dungeon hidden behind that gate was definitely the most interesting and impressive part of the experience, as you end up in this giant hallway in which a corrupted red dragon patrols, and you need to sneak around and kill six enchanters around the room to bring down his 95% damage reduction shield. That <i>definitely</i> felt very vanilla.</p><p>The very last boss turned out to be Zuluhed the Whacked, which made me go "oh, I know this guy", though it took me a moment to recall that in official WoW lore, this particular orc leader went to Outland and enslaved the Netherwing there. Not sure it\'s an upgrade for him to become a mid-level dungeon end boss instead, but it was a cool reveal nonetheless.</p><p>Also, shoutout to Hoodedmon the troll shaman, who was our tank on the second run and did a bang-up job both with the tanking itself as well as providing general leadership and explanations of what to do. He was also the first shaman tank I encountered on Turtle WoW, which wasn\'t that new a concept to me considering they were a big hit in Season of Discovery, but I hadn\'t realised that specialisation was available on Turtle WoW as well.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/09/dragonmaw-retreat-custom-dungeon.html'}], 'link': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/09/dragonmaw-retreat-custom-dungeon.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDSwgoJcfI40RbV13gmzGU5aGRgr4nd9PWRzzrIIM_senkRTcelSpZWR2wDY8t7oLCtUpAQVrsw81B95l-_0He12U5m1mQsyraGeti9WoY4RdJ36JZQy3UY1TREXQKJTZZJO-oI78TadFabBSeNsK1je0ZDoeLAw5RANCH83jrYwQ0JggtgiPN6eh1-WSZ/s72-w400-h300-c/Dragonmaw%20Retreat%20map.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

I <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/09/i-decided-to-try-turtle-wow-before-it.html">wasn\'t exaggerating</a> when I compared the experience to 2019 Classic, including the urge to log in whenever I can, even if it\'s only to take care of one small task at a time.</p><p>After I initially completed the <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/09/i-decided-to-try-turtle-wow-before-it.html">high elf starter zone</a>, the thought of going back to the same old content that I\'ve done many times before seemed a bit underwhelming. There doesn\'t currently seem to be a unique new quest hub or zone for Alliance characters in the low teens, presumably because so many people go to Westfall during that time anyway. However, <a href="https://turtle-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Custom_Turtle_WoW_content">based on the Turtle WoW Wiki</a>, new custom content seemed within reach if I could only knock out another ten levels or so, which I figured shouldn\'t be that hard this early in the levelling process.</p><p>So I travelled around several of the classic 10-20 zones, doing a few select quests in each one, and being fascinated by where random new quests showed up mixed in with the old ones. In Elwynn I befriended a sheep called Lulu for example, which then became my pet. And if you ever thought it was odd that Marshal Dughan asked you to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=76/the-jasperlode-mine">explore the Jasperlode Mine</a> just to then not follow up on what you find in there - well, on Turtle WoW he actually asks you to go back there and <i>kill</i> those giant spiders.</p><p>I also found new stand-alone quests in places where they felt like very natural additions, such as the dwarven fisherman down by Loch Modan asking you to kill some threshadons, or the first night elf house you come across when going down to Ashenvale now having a night elven couple in it that ask you to check in on a furbolg and hunt some wolves. Again, I could nitpick about things like odd word choices and typos in the quest text, but I loved that it just felt right that there was something to find in those places now.</p><p>There were other random changes to the world to notice. For example Stormwind has the harbour that was added in Wrath, and the boat from Auberdine to Menethil was rerouted from the latter to go to Stormwind instead - which means no more Wetlands death runs for night elves, but also makes Darnassus as a capital way more connected so it doesn\'t feel too bad to go there now. You can even do your auction business there without it being too annoying because the devs added a mailbox next to the auction house building, meaning it\'s no longer necessary to run all the way back to the bank all the time.</p><p>Fishing has been another interesting exercise. Fishing has always had the reputation of being a decent moneymaker, but my experience in WoW Classic has always been that on the Classic megaservers, there\'s too much competition for pools and it\'s hard to claim any for yourself. Turtle WoW must have increased the spawn rates for fishing pools massively, because even though the server is incredibly busy and I do see people fishing all over the place, there are always more pools to grab. This doesn\'t seem to have hurt demand either: I had about one gold to my name when I decided to stop at the Auberdine docks to fish from some pools that I noticed there - a few hours later I was up to ten gold and could buy myself a 16-slot bag (which was only a fraction of the price you\'d be charged on official Classic servers).</p><p>They clearly made other changes as well - for example I keep finding Sagefish along the coast, which is purely a freshwater fish in regular Classic. Also, the lowest rank Rumsey Rum which you can find in certain pools is usually vendor trash, but for some reason I could sell it for ten silver a pop on Turtle.&nbsp;</p><p>Not everything\'s great, as there are also bugs with fishing - I was unable to fish in Crystal Lake for some reason, and at other times I would catch something but would be unable to loot it and the fish would end up lost. Still, overall fishing has been fun and a great boon.</p><p>Chucking things on the auction house has also felt better than it has in a while, again thanks to small changes I noticed compared to "pure" Vanilla. The maximum listing time has been increased from 24 to 72 hours, and while I haven\'t done the maths, listing fees seem drastically reduced compared to regular Vanilla, with many low-level items not having any at all, which actually makes it viable to throw up low-level crafting mats for a few copper without making a loss. I\'ve been kind of impressed with how materials are simultaneously abundant and affordable, but still sufficiently in demand that you can actually make a small profit off everything you sell (which is once again a contrast to official Classic, where I remember the leather market for example sometimes being so flooded that you were better off just vendoring it all).</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZn3mddNozGOTYb4OBV_NyZpjH4H8JkJA_stb00T3t6tLBX_NTq5U0vVl-EmlNR-bx3kwKHjflO7GfIq6B3xyZIjGAnu6rDLxnM6xLmyi1s6iqORrF0LUjru6kwJRj7PvDiz9Tr-66-DmVRwIfyum0HY5_pMoN7HEVn9_If7qLpbjgOoN7PNBoVL0qqt4s/s993/Tiranea%20riding%20her%20turtle%20mount%20through%20Elwynn%20Forest.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female high elf riding the Turtle WoW turtle mount through Elwynn Forest, with her crimson hawkstrider running along by her side" border="0" height="268" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZn3mddNozGOTYb4OBV_NyZpjH4H8JkJA_stb00T3t6tLBX_NTq5U0vVl-EmlNR-bx3kwKHjflO7GfIq6B3xyZIjGAnu6rDLxnM6xLmyi1s6iqORrF0LUjru6kwJRj7PvDiz9Tr-66-DmVRwIfyum0HY5_pMoN7HEVn9_If7qLpbjgOoN7PNBoVL0qqt4s/w400-h268/Tiranea%20riding%20her%20turtle%20mount%20through%20Elwynn%20Forest.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>At level 18 I could set out to the Darkmoon Faire to get the low-level turtle mount, which matches the server\'s name. It doesn\'t actually speed you up a lot, but around level 20 when you start having to travel around a lot more, it still feels good to be able to go even a little bit faster. (Plus it actually swims if you walk it into a lake or river!) I thought that was quite an elegant solution to making travel just a little bit easier without devaluing the level 40 mount.</p><p>I also really liked the quest text for this one by the way, as I thought it was very clever and fit well into the existing lore. I never really thought about the fact that Torta and Tooga in Tanaris are talking tortoises and how odd that is even in Azeroth, yet nobody ever remarks on it. It seemed appropriate that Silas Darkmoon would be fascinated by magical talking turtles!</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhhPeYIofqfJleYAgTCvCaf5pk5v2uv4LVtWa9kqv7wVsbgO_Zb0G9R47i_vaqrvIOVXYR40kfGnGEedxpOJkRASi-g1sOGjrjHp3ni7kj6GzmmEfv2DnlepBDunpWJ5AWopj9r1vjvLhla0FUBYYthJM_B1rwxZ4VnD4bdLAKgfPFiNKMBwrZ6PWIsjSW/s1197/Torta\'s%20Egg%20quest.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Silas Darkmoon giving the quest &quot;Torta\'s Egg&quot;.

She asked me to find her husband, Tooga. Apparently he got lost a lot, but he also was able to speak! Never in my life have I seen such a thing. But sadly they didn\'t wish to join the Faire, however Torta offered me one of her eggs and that\'s the precious gift I\'m talking about, I think it was about to hatch too. Please, bring back my egg.&quot;" border="0" height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhhPeYIofqfJleYAgTCvCaf5pk5v2uv4LVtWa9kqv7wVsbgO_Zb0G9R47i_vaqrvIOVXYR40kfGnGEedxpOJkRASi-g1sOGjrjHp3ni7kj6GzmmEfv2DnlepBDunpWJ5AWopj9r1vjvLhla0FUBYYthJM_B1rwxZ4VnD4bdLAKgfPFiNKMBwrZ6PWIsjSW/w400-h195/Torta\'s%20Egg%20quest.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>I thought I\'d also queue for a quick Deadmines, because I always love me some Deadmines. I actually got a group instantly, but the experience was not at all what I expected. Four of us arrived at the dungeon before the tank, so I thought we could at least start pulling some mobs in the tunnel, right? As a hunter with a pet I was generally able to take a same-level elite as long as I took a bit of care. Not here, though! The very first mob murdered my pet in only a few hits and then got me too.<p></p><p>It reminded me of how when WoW Classic came out, it turned out that Vanilla private servers were way overtuned in terms of difficulty compared to the real thing, just because everyone remembered things being way harder than they had objectively been at the time. Apparently the Turtle WoW devs never revised that tuning for dungeons, whether intentionally or by mistake, which meant that our progress was very slow as the tank took an absolute beating on every pull, making the healer go almost oom. I don\'t really know how I feel about that. I don\'t like people rushing through dungeons, so making them harder in order to force people to slow down should be right up my alley, but it\'s the freaking Deadmines, your very first dungeon as Alliance - it just felt way over the top.</p><p>I also came to learn that the Turtle WoW devs had added two new rooms with new bosses to this dungeon. The first one was a Defias alchemist guy, and I didn\'t get to see the second one at first as the group wiped, people got separated, and then we disbanded. Not what I expected of the Deadmines! (I did later do another run that actually managed to complete the dungeon, but it also included a wipe and once again felt quite slow and tedious, even with everyone being quite high level compared to the mobs in the instance.)</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFmXhRqPj724rBVfcFHyXCZlB_-cy5doFeZmaydjWtEqIbLjGXG01XZ148yv3n3rq7EzEJb5LjUF_QAPBTO2AmTbUXsk0yKPFClytO-bJe2ApNKe6TRnVY3FJ3EV5Uq5_-oL0ApeBgcU6DmVNKxsdoMRzTIOuLon-Z0W_gDqv99Omt-BplZW9r_pcJU1cD/s1920/At%20first%20new%20boss%20in%20Deadmines.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A party of low level adventurers surrounded by alchemical tanks in the Deadmines, about to face the alchemist Jared Vess" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFmXhRqPj724rBVfcFHyXCZlB_-cy5doFeZmaydjWtEqIbLjGXG01XZ148yv3n3rq7EzEJb5LjUF_QAPBTO2AmTbUXsk0yKPFClytO-bJe2ApNKe6TRnVY3FJ3EV5Uq5_-oL0ApeBgcU6DmVNKxsdoMRzTIOuLon-Z0W_gDqv99Omt-BplZW9r_pcJU1cD/w400-h225/At%20first%20new%20boss%20in%20Deadmines.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Also, another small note on community: I once again got confirmation that there are a number of guilds and groups that are just super dedicated to Vanilla and will always go where it\'s currently at its liveliest. I spotted someone in Stormwind who had "Group Therapy" as his guild tag and went "Wait, like <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2019/10/guilded.html">the guild I was in during early Classic</a> six years ago?"

I <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/09/i-decided-to-try-turtle-wow-before-it.html">wasn\'t exaggerating</a> when I compared the experience to 2019 Classic, including the urge to log in whenever I can, even if it\'s only to take care of one small task at a time.</p><p>After I initially completed the <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/09/i-decided-to-try-turtle-wow-before-it.html">high elf starter zone</a>, the thought of going back to the same old content that I\'ve done many times before seemed a bit underwhelming. There doesn\'t currently seem to be a unique new quest hub or zone for Alliance characters in the low teens, presumably because so many people go to Westfall during that time anyway. However, <a href="https://turtle-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Custom_Turtle_WoW_content">based on the Turtle WoW Wiki</a>, new custom content seemed within reach if I could only knock out another ten levels or so, which I figured shouldn\'t be that hard this early in the levelling process.</p><p>So I travelled around several of the classic 10-20 zones, doing a few select quests in each one, and being fascinated by where random new quests showed up mixed in with the old ones. In Elwynn I befriended a sheep called Lulu for example, which then became my pet. And if you ever thought it was odd that Marshal Dughan asked you to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=76/the-jasperlode-mine">explore the Jasperlode Mine</a> just to then not follow up on what you find in there - well, on Turtle WoW he actually asks you to go back there and <i>kill</i> those giant spiders.</p><p>I also found new stand-alone quests in places where they felt like very natural additions, such as the dwarven fisherman down by Loch Modan asking you to kill some threshadons, or the first night elf house you come across when going down to Ashenvale now having a night elven couple in it that ask you to check in on a furbolg and hunt some wolves. Again, I could nitpick about things like odd word choices and typos in the quest text, but I loved that it just felt right that there was something to find in those places now.</p><p>There were other random changes to the world to notice. For example Stormwind has the harbour that was added in Wrath, and the boat from Auberdine to Menethil was rerouted from the latter to go to Stormwind instead - which means no more Wetlands death runs for night elves, but also makes Darnassus as a capital way more connected so it doesn\'t feel too bad to go there now. You can even do your auction business there without it being too annoying because the devs added a mailbox next to the auction house building, meaning it\'s no longer necessary to run all the way back to the bank all the time.</p><p>Fishing has been another interesting exercise. Fishing has always had the reputation of being a decent moneymaker, but my experience in WoW Classic has always been that on the Classic megaservers, there\'s too much competition for pools and it\'s hard to claim any for yourself. Turtle WoW must have increased the spawn rates for fishing pools massively, because even though the server is incredibly busy and I do see people fishing all over the place, there are always more pools to grab. This doesn\'t seem to have hurt demand either: I had about one gold to my name when I decided to stop at the Auberdine docks to fish from some pools that I noticed there - a few hours later I was up to ten gold and could buy myself a 16-slot bag (which was only a fraction of the price you\'d be charged on official Classic servers).</p><p>They clearly made other changes as well - for example I keep finding Sagefish along the coast, which is purely a freshwater fish in regular Classic. Also, the lowest rank Rumsey Rum which you can find in certain pools is usually vendor trash, but for some reason I could sell it for ten silver a pop on Turtle.&nbsp;</p><p>Not everything\'s great, as there are also bugs with fishing - I was unable to fish in Crystal Lake for some reason, and at other times I would catch something but would be unable to loot it and the fish would end up lost. Still, overall fishing has been fun and a great boon.</p><p>Chucking things on the auction house has also felt better than it has in a while, again thanks to small changes I noticed compared to "pure" Vanilla. The maximum listing time has been increased from 24 to 72 hours, and while I haven\'t done the maths, listing fees seem drastically reduced compared to regular Vanilla, with many low-level items not having any at all, which actually makes it viable to throw up low-level crafting mats for a few copper without making a loss. I\'ve been kind of impressed with how materials are simultaneously abundant and affordable, but still sufficiently in demand that you can actually make a small profit off everything you sell (which is once again a contrast to official Classic, where I remember the leather market for example sometimes being so flooded that you were better off just vendoring it all).</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZn3mddNozGOTYb4OBV_NyZpjH4H8JkJA_stb00T3t6tLBX_NTq5U0vVl-EmlNR-bx3kwKHjflO7GfIq6B3xyZIjGAnu6rDLxnM6xLmyi1s6iqORrF0LUjru6kwJRj7PvDiz9Tr-66-DmVRwIfyum0HY5_pMoN7HEVn9_If7qLpbjgOoN7PNBoVL0qqt4s/s993/Tiranea%20riding%20her%20turtle%20mount%20through%20Elwynn%20Forest.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female high elf riding the Turtle WoW turtle mount through Elwynn Forest, with her crimson hawkstrider running along by her side" border="0" height="268" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZn3mddNozGOTYb4OBV_NyZpjH4H8JkJA_stb00T3t6tLBX_NTq5U0vVl-EmlNR-bx3kwKHjflO7GfIq6B3xyZIjGAnu6rDLxnM6xLmyi1s6iqORrF0LUjru6kwJRj7PvDiz9Tr-66-DmVRwIfyum0HY5_pMoN7HEVn9_If7qLpbjgOoN7PNBoVL0qqt4s/w400-h268/Tiranea%20riding%20her%20turtle%20mount%20through%20Elwynn%20Forest.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>At level 18 I could set out to the Darkmoon Faire to get the low-level turtle mount, which matches the server\'s name. It doesn\'t actually speed you up a lot, but around level 20 when you start having to travel around a lot more, it still feels good to be able to go even a little bit faster. (Plus it actually swims if you walk it into a lake or river!) I thought that was quite an elegant solution to making travel just a little bit easier without devaluing the level 40 mount.</p><p>I also really liked the quest text for this one by the way, as I thought it was very clever and fit well into the existing lore. I never really thought about the fact that Torta and Tooga in Tanaris are talking tortoises and how odd that is even in Azeroth, yet nobody ever remarks on it. It seemed appropriate that Silas Darkmoon would be fascinated by magical talking turtles!</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhhPeYIofqfJleYAgTCvCaf5pk5v2uv4LVtWa9kqv7wVsbgO_Zb0G9R47i_vaqrvIOVXYR40kfGnGEedxpOJkRASi-g1sOGjrjHp3ni7kj6GzmmEfv2DnlepBDunpWJ5AWopj9r1vjvLhla0FUBYYthJM_B1rwxZ4VnD4bdLAKgfPFiNKMBwrZ6PWIsjSW/s1197/Torta\'s%20Egg%20quest.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Silas Darkmoon giving the quest &quot;Torta\'s Egg&quot;.

She asked me to find her husband, Tooga. Apparently he got lost a lot, but he also was able to speak! Never in my life have I seen such a thing.

I actually got a group instantly, but the experience was not at all what I expected. Four of us arrived at the dungeon before the tank, so I thought we could at least start pulling some mobs in the tunnel, right? As a hunter with a pet I was generally able to take a same-level elite as long as I took a bit of care. Not here, though! The very first mob murdered my pet in only a few hits and then got me too.<p></p><p>It reminded me of how when WoW Classic came out, it turned out that Vanilla private servers were way overtuned in terms of difficulty compared to the real thing, just because everyone remembered things being way harder than they had objectively been at the time. Apparently the Turtle WoW devs never revised that tuning for dungeons, whether intentionally or by mistake, which meant that our progress was very slow as the tank took an absolute beating on every pull, making the healer go almost oom. I don\'t really know how I feel about that. I don\'t like people rushing through dungeons, so making them harder in order to force people to slow down should be right up my alley, but it\'s the freaking Deadmines, your very first dungeon as Alliance - it just felt way over the top.</p><p>I also came to learn that the Turtle WoW devs had added two new rooms with new bosses to this dungeon. The first one was a Defias alchemist guy, and I didn\'t get to see the second one at first as the group wiped, people got separated, and then we disbanded. Not what I expected of the Deadmines! (I did later do another run that actually managed to complete the dungeon, but it also included a wipe and once again felt quite slow and tedious, even with everyone being quite high level compared to the mobs in the instance.)</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFmXhRqPj724rBVfcFHyXCZlB_-cy5doFeZmaydjWtEqIbLjGXG01XZ148yv3n3rq7EzEJb5LjUF_QAPBTO2AmTbUXsk0yKPFClytO-bJe2ApNKe6TRnVY3FJ3EV5Uq5_-oL0ApeBgcU6DmVNKxsdoMRzTIOuLon-Z0W_gDqv99Omt-BplZW9r_pcJU1cD/s1920/At%20first%20new%20boss%20in%20Deadmines.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A party of low level adventurers surrounded by alchemical tanks in the Deadmines, about to face the alchemist Jared Vess" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFmXhRqPj724rBVfcFHyXCZlB_-cy5doFeZmaydjWtEqIbLjGXG01XZ148yv3n3rq7EzEJb5LjUF_QAPBTO2AmTbUXsk0yKPFClytO-bJe2ApNKe6TRnVY3FJ3EV5Uq5_-oL0ApeBgcU6DmVNKxsdoMRzTIOuLon-Z0W_gDqv99Omt-BplZW9r_pcJU1cD/w400-h225/At%20first%20new%20boss%20in%20Deadmines.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Also, another small note on community: I once again got confirmation that there are a number of guilds and groups that are just super dedicated to Vanilla and will always go where it\'s currently at its liveliest.

I excitedly pressed the "Let\'s do this!" button and quickly found myself in a group with four Horde characters. Now, I\'d read some stuff about cross-faction play being a thing on Turtle, so that part wasn\'t really a surprise, however what <i>was</i> a surprise - and an unpleasant one at that - was the lack of a teleport to the dungeon.</p><p>So here I was, a level 13 Alliance player in Elwynn Forest, with the rest of my group waiting for me in Orgrimmar. Oh. OH.</p><p>I immediately apologised, telling them that I was new to the server and had expected this automated group finder to work like Wrath\'s, and that it probably wasn\'t worth waiting for me to get over there. I felt profoundly embarrassed, and part of me wanted to quit group right there, but I also hate leaving a group I only just joined, so I kind of hovered for a bit to await the party\'s judgement. Maybe Turtle WoW also had summoning stones? Someone (I think it was the tank but I\'m not 100% sure now) said that it was fine and that they could probably wrangle a higher-level warlock into summoning me over there.</p><p>Still feeling a bit sheepish and uncertain about what to do with myself now, I decided that the best course of action for me was to at least make a good faith attempt at legging it to Orgrimmar in the meantime, even if I was unlikely to get very far. When I arrived in Darkshore, I noticed some strange things happening to the group, with people leaving and re-joining repeatedly, until the whole party was suddenly disbanded - or at least, I was suddenly group-less.</p><p>I just figured that I\'d been kicked after all and felt a little sad, even if I thought it was understandable. As I was already on the road, I kept running south in an attempt to at least make it to Astranaar, since I was already in the area. However, not soon after, I got a re-invite to the group, and this time it included a level 60 troll warlock who sent me a summon. I appeared in Orgrimmar in front of the RFC entrance and thanked everyone once again.</p><p>Aside from me, the group consisted of a bear druid tank, an undead mage, a goblin warlock and an undead priest healer. The mage handed out some water and we quickly seemed to be off to a good start inside the dungeon.</p><p>At one point a green cloak with +2 agility dropped, and since I was still wearing a white, I rolled need on it. I wasn\'t surprised that I didn\'t win, but I <i>was</i> surprised that the other person who had rolled need on it was the warlock. Still, I wasn\'t going to complain - for all I knew, classes might be working differently on this server and I&nbsp;had only <i>just</i> had a demonstration of how little I actually knew about how things worked around these parts.</p><p>However, the mage took note, was not pleased and asked the warlock why they were needing on everything. It was only then that I noticed that the lock had indeed also needed on other items such as random gems. "I\'m a JC" was their defense, which I thought was pretty weak (especially since I was one too) but again I didn\'t say anything. The mage continued to argue and rant about it though, and the lock started passing on everything for a little while, though they later resumed rolling.</p><p>The mage then also started complaining that the lock was just on follow and not actually doing any damage. I couldn\'t tell whether that was true, but it did seem like they were mostly just ambling about and not casting any spells. Still, nobody was responding to these accusations at all, even when the mage started outright demanding that the group leader should just kick the warlock already. It was as if they were just shouting into a void.</p><p>We made it past the first boss, but on one of the trash pulls that followed, my hawkstrider pet suddenly shot off into another group of mobs around the corner. I\'ve played Classic hunter for so long now and have had so many pet accidents, but I still don\'t know what caused this particular one, as he was not on aggressive and the mobs were around a corner and not even visible to me. Either way, the moment I saw what was happening I said "omg, I\'m so sorry, I don\'t know why he did that". We tried our best, but sadly it was too many mobs at once and we wiped.</p><p>The mage made one last complaint about how the warlock was supposedly only auto-attacking, before calling us all the "worst classic group ever" and quitting the party. Everyone else cared about that about as much as they had cared about the person\'s previous complaints, which is to say nobody even commented on it in any way. We just ran back, revived, and then finished the rest of the dungeon just fine with the four of us who remained.</p><p>When we exited the instance, my hearthstone was still on cooldown, so I thought I\'d take a look at this apparently cross-faction-friendly Orgrimmar, but I had barely taken two steps away from the instance portal when a guard ran up and one-shot me. So, uh... so much for that.</p><p>Nonetheless, I thought this was a very educational experience. I can see now why no Alliance players are queueing for RFC, and I\'m not sure why the game would list it as a "recommended dungeon" when you\'re supposed to walk all the way to Org as an Ally. Considering my encounter with the guard, it seems unlikely that a full Alliance group would even be able to make it there without a lot of corpse-running.</p><p>The mage was a weird character because I could kind of understand their complaints (my pet mishap wiping the group was definitely worthy of some disdain I thought) but they were just... <i>so</i> angry about everything. It\'s RFC, man, and maybe that warlock is someone\'s kid or a complete newbie or whatever, no need to get quite so wound up about it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the druid tank was an absolute saint, organising the summon for me and also telling me "no worries" after I\'d caused the wipe. The best and the worst of most Classic environments in a nutshell.&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>I felt that my first dungeon run on <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/09/i-decided-to-try-turtle-wow-before-it.html">Turtle WoW</a>&nbsp;was worthy of its own post, because it turned into quite an unexpected adventure (in both good and bad ways).</p><p>To set the scene, I noticed early on that Turtle\'s UI included the little dungeon finder eye that was added during Wrath of the Lich King as an icon on the edge of the mini map.

OH.</p><p>I immediately apologised, telling them that I was new to the server and had expected this automated group finder to work like Wrath\'s, and that it probably wasn\'t worth waiting for me to get over there. I felt profoundly embarrassed, and part of me wanted to quit group right there, but I also hate leaving a group I only just joined, so I kind of hovered for a bit to await the party\'s judgement. Maybe Turtle WoW also had summoning stones? Someone (I think it was the tank but I\'m not 100% sure now) said that it was fine and that they could probably wrangle a higher-level warlock into summoning me over there.</p><p>Still feeling a bit sheepish and uncertain about what to do with myself now, I decided that the best course of action for me was to at least make a good faith attempt at legging it to Orgrimmar in the meantime, even if I was unlikely to get very far. When I arrived in Darkshore, I noticed some strange things happening to the group, with people leaving and re-joining repeatedly, until the whole party was suddenly disbanded - or at least, I was suddenly group-less.</p><p>I just figured that I\'d been kicked after all and felt a little sad, even if I thought it was understandable. As I was already on the road, I kept running south in an attempt to at least make it to Astranaar, since I was already in the area. However, not soon after, I got a re-invite to the group, and this time it included a level 60 troll warlock who sent me a summon. I appeared in Orgrimmar in front of the RFC entrance and thanked everyone once again.</p><p>Aside from me, the group consisted of a bear druid tank, an undead mage, a goblin warlock and an undead priest healer. The mage handed out some water and we quickly seemed to be off to a good start inside the dungeon.</p><p>At one point a green cloak with +2 agility dropped, and since I was still wearing a white, I rolled need on it. I wasn\'t surprised that I didn\'t win, but I <i>was</i> surprised that the other person who had rolled need on it was the warlock. Still, I wasn\'t going to complain - for all I knew, classes might be working differently on this server and I&nbsp;had only <i>just</i> had a demonstration of how little I actually knew about how things worked around these parts.</p><p>However, the mage took note, was not pleased and asked the warlock why they were needing on everything. It was only then that I noticed that the lock had indeed also needed on other items such as random gems. "I\'m a JC" was their defense, which I thought was pretty weak (especially since I was one too) but again I didn\'t say anything. The mage continued to argue and rant about it though, and the lock started passing on everything for a little while, though they later resumed rolling.</p><p>The mage then also started complaining that the lock was just on follow and not actually doing any damage. I couldn\'t tell whether that was true, but it did seem like they were mostly just ambling about and not casting any spells. Still, nobody was responding to these accusations at all, even when the mage started outright demanding that the group leader should just kick the warlock already. It was as if they were just shouting into a void.</p><p>We made it past the first boss, but on one of the trash pulls that followed, my hawkstrider pet suddenly shot off into another group of mobs around the corner. I\'ve played Classic hunter for so long now and have had so many pet accidents, but I still don\'t know what caused this particular one, as he was not on aggressive and the mobs were around a corner and not even visible to me. Either way, the moment I saw what was happening I said "omg, I\'m so sorry, I don\'t know why he did that". We tried our best, but sadly it was too many mobs at once and we wiped.</p><p>The mage made one last complaint about how the warlock was supposedly only auto-attacking, before calling us all the "worst classic group ever" and quitting the party. Everyone else cared about that about as much as they had cared about the person\'s previous complaints, which is to say nobody even commented on it in any way. We just ran back, revived, and then finished the rest of the dungeon just fine with the four of us who remained.</p><p>When we exited the instance, my hearthstone was still on cooldown, so I thought I\'d take a look at this apparently cross-faction-friendly Orgrimmar, but I had barely taken two steps away from the instance portal when a guard ran up and one-shot me. So, uh... so much for that.</p><p>Nonetheless, I thought this was a very educational experience. I can see now why no Alliance players are queueing for RFC, and I\'m not sure why the game would list it as a "recommended dungeon" when you\'re supposed to walk all the way to Org as an Ally. Considering my encounter with the guard, it seems unlikely that a full Alliance group would even be able to make it there without a lot of corpse-running.</p><p>The mage was a weird character because I could kind of understand their complaints (my pet mishap wiping the group was definitely worthy of some disdain I thought) but they were just... <i>so</i> angry about everything. It\'s RFC, man, and maybe that warlock is someone\'s kid or a complete newbie or whatever, no need to get quite so wound up about it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the druid tank was an absolute saint, organising the summon for me and also telling me "no worries" after I\'d caused the wipe. The best and the worst of most Classic environments in a nutshell.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/09/my-first-dungeon-on-turtle-wow-was-messy.html'}], 'link': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/09/my-first-dungeon-on-turtle-wow-was-messy.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhItQX5jxbV2yG-_hU8ARstovtdDOyCTkedgJZWJQs28d0VzXkQEf2q5yVsGb4EnwO42wIQ7T8RfK7lespcFKeKwI-dNP_nYATX5RAhsSWxyuscnT1EA35K3F3uOiNbVoXLzWBeGkH473LZNCmAnyOy3KcjPr8bc6mk1VQSU3GzjoM0qTKQWONv9qKy__bb/s72-w400-h258-c/Ragefire%20Chasm%20group%20finder%20pop-up.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '3'}

In a video about Turtle WoW from years ago, I\'d seen newly created high elves simply get plopped down in Loch Modan with some starter quests around Farstrider Lodge.

"Come on," you might say, "it\'s kill-ten-rats kind of stuff, how much originality do you expect?" But I\'m not talking about the tasks themselves - rather about the story and theming around them.</p><p>Every WoW starting zone has quests to kill some local wildlife, but the context varies. As a whole, each starting zone paints a picture of the culture your character belongs to, what its values are and what problems it faces. The blood elf starting zone is very different from the human starting zone, which is very different from the undead starting zone. What stood out to me about the high elf starting zone in Turtle WoW was that it seemed to lack a clear theme and felt more like some weird amalgamation of Elwynn Forest and Eversong Woods quests viewed through a fun house mirror: Here\'s the quest where some guy asks you to pick flowers for a girl he likes, here\'s the quest where an elf wants to throw a party and needs you to fetch supplies. Here\'s the quest with the vineyard where grapes have been abandoned in buckets and you need to fetch them. (Though oddly, no grapevines in sight - the implication seemed to be that they grow on the giant trees?)</p><p>All that just hit a nerve with me because I hate the idea that people might think that the gold standard for Classic+ should be to just retell the exact same stories over and over again. It\'s like those people who don\'t like anything Star Wars if it doesn\'t have a lost Skywalker finding the Force in it.</p><p>Anyway... that was a bit of tangent. Let\'s talk professions! I initially wanted to learn skinning and leatherworking, but the skinning trainer in town didn\'t seem to exist. I saw a jewelcrafting trainer nearby and went "Ooh, they have that here?", so I trained that and mining instead. In an interesting twist, it\'s not the same as Burning Crusade jewelcrafting. From what I\'ve seen so far, the basic rings are present but have had their recipes changed, and there are a lot of new and different recipes as well.</p><p>Unfortunately, secondary professions seem to have gotten the short end of the stick in comparison, at least based on my experience in this zone. While there was a fishing trainer, the fishing skill requirement was way too high for a starter zone and fish were always getting away from me even with a lure applied. There were no fishing pools along the coast either. Cooking and first aid were likewise trainable in the vicinity, but none of the animals actually dropped meat that could be cooked, and apart from a handful of ghost mobs in the north-western corner of the map, nothing seemed to drop linen for first aid either.</p><p>I could go on and on... but despite these nitpicks and annoyances - I had fun. There was definitely something very refreshing and exciting about being in a vaguely Vanilla-like starting zone without having any idea of what awaited me. I loved not knowing what I\'d see next whenever I crested a hill, or finding an unexpected quest giver inside a building.&nbsp;I quickly lost track of time while playing, and when I got up the next \nmorning, I kept thinking about my little elf, eager to go back and play \nsome more in a way I probably hadn\'t done since 2019\'s Classic launch.</p><p>For all the small details I noticed being off, there was still a lot to be impressed by, such as the fact that the whole zone of Thalassian Highlands is an original creation (even if it clearly recycles a lot of assets from Eversong), including the composition of original zone music. And there are other loving touches, such as that they updated the Vanilla loading screens for Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms to include high elves and goblins. The Turtle WoW creators clearly have a lot of love for Vanilla; there are just gaps in the details.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIwzyKtq3CdoliNClSTI5PhkdrpDtPzqDEKiUZocU1u-HrTPacsFXv-Ij0_TX2YAl5S2dKsmHd6PFJ7wsprtcPFxarFr3uLQKgcTCM0gjOomP6czlevjhyEXR4_4gk49j76VrDjTAajnx26wN_u1Nn6P4XdKXJeRCtx94FjXTo1fZL6EjSJ8CCaPiWi9Md/s1920/Turtle%20WoW%20Eastern%20Kingdoms%20loading%20screen%20with%20high%20elf.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The Classic Eastern Kingdoms loading screen, with black and white drawings of a human, dwarf, gnome and undead, with a high elf added in the bottom right corner, and the WoW logo having the subtitle &quot;Mysteries of Azeroth&quot;" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIwzyKtq3CdoliNClSTI5PhkdrpDtPzqDEKiUZocU1u-HrTPacsFXv-Ij0_TX2YAl5S2dKsmHd6PFJ7wsprtcPFxarFr3uLQKgcTCM0gjOomP6czlevjhyEXR4_4gk49j76VrDjTAajnx26wN_u1Nn6P4XdKXJeRCtx94FjXTo1fZL6EjSJ8CCaPiWi9Md/w400-h225/Turtle%20WoW%20Eastern%20Kingdoms%20loading%20screen%20with%20high%20elf.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>At one point when I got tired of dying constantly due to my low level, I ran towards what looked like the local docks on the map, and jumped onto the first boat that arrived to take me somewhere else, anywhere else. I ended up in Auberdine, and found that someone had pitched a tent outside the inn. I had heard about these, so I stood under it, and within the course of five minutes or so, I saw my rested XP shoot up by about half a level. While I soon hearthed back home, that restedness helped me to finally catch up a bit in levels, so thanks, anonymous tent-builder.</p><p>This seems like a good point to mention community. Again, this is something that I\'d heard a lot of praise for before, so I was admittedly a bit confused when for my first few levels I couldn\'t get anyone to talk to me. By that I mean that people would group up for a quest and cooperate, but I would literally get zero reply to anything I said. I was starting to wonder whether there was some hidden chat restriction for low-level characters or something. I think I was around level 9 when a friendly mage finally talked to me while we briefly grouped up for a quest to kill murlocs. They even offered to continue questing together, but unfortunately I had to log off just after that. The only other verbal interaction I\'ve had since then was some random whispering me to compliment me on my "thicc elf booty". All in all, I would rate that as similar to playing on a Blizzard PvE server before they merged everything into the mega servers - neither notably better nor worse. But then, you can\'t really have a non-megaserver experience in most of the official Classic versions anymore, so...</p><p>After I\'d completed all the quests in Thalassian Highlands (as far as I could tell), I tried to do some research on what else might be interesting to check out, whether there was another custom zone I could go to at my level.

(Though oddly, no grapevines in sight - the implication seemed to be that they grow on the giant trees?)</p><p>All that just hit a nerve with me because I hate the idea that people might think that the gold standard for Classic+ should be to just retell the exact same stories over and over again. It\'s like those people who don\'t like anything Star Wars if it doesn\'t have a lost Skywalker finding the Force in it.</p><p>Anyway... that was a bit of tangent. Let\'s talk professions! I initially wanted to learn skinning and leatherworking, but the skinning trainer in town didn\'t seem to exist. I saw a jewelcrafting trainer nearby and went "Ooh, they have that here?", so I trained that and mining instead. In an interesting twist, it\'s not the same as Burning Crusade jewelcrafting. From what I\'ve seen so far, the basic rings are present but have had their recipes changed, and there are a lot of new and different recipes as well.</p><p>Unfortunately, secondary professions seem to have gotten the short end of the stick in comparison, at least based on my experience in this zone. While there was a fishing trainer, the fishing skill requirement was way too high for a starter zone and fish were always getting away from me even with a lure applied. There were no fishing pools along the coast either. Cooking and first aid were likewise trainable in the vicinity, but none of the animals actually dropped meat that could be cooked, and apart from a handful of ghost mobs in the north-western corner of the map, nothing seemed to drop linen for first aid either.</p><p>I could go on and on... but despite these nitpicks and annoyances - I had fun. There was definitely something very refreshing and exciting about being in a vaguely Vanilla-like starting zone without having any idea of what awaited me. I loved not knowing what I\'d see next whenever I crested a hill, or finding an unexpected quest giver inside a building.&nbsp;I quickly lost track of time while playing, and when I got up the next \nmorning, I kept thinking about my little elf, eager to go back and play \nsome more in a way I probably hadn\'t done since 2019\'s Classic launch.</p><p>For all the small details I noticed being off, there was still a lot to be impressed by, such as the fact that the whole zone of Thalassian Highlands is an original creation (even if it clearly recycles a lot of assets from Eversong), including the composition of original zone music. And there are other loving touches, such as that they updated the Vanilla loading screens for Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms to include high elves and goblins. The Turtle WoW creators clearly have a lot of love for Vanilla; there are just gaps in the details.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIwzyKtq3CdoliNClSTI5PhkdrpDtPzqDEKiUZocU1u-HrTPacsFXv-Ij0_TX2YAl5S2dKsmHd6PFJ7wsprtcPFxarFr3uLQKgcTCM0gjOomP6czlevjhyEXR4_4gk49j76VrDjTAajnx26wN_u1Nn6P4XdKXJeRCtx94FjXTo1fZL6EjSJ8CCaPiWi9Md/s1920/Turtle%20WoW%20Eastern%20Kingdoms%20loading%20screen%20with%20high%20elf.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The Classic Eastern Kingdoms loading screen, with black and white drawings of a human, dwarf, gnome and undead, with a high elf added in the bottom right corner, and the WoW logo having the subtitle &quot;Mysteries of Azeroth&quot;" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIwzyKtq3CdoliNClSTI5PhkdrpDtPzqDEKiUZocU1u-HrTPacsFXv-Ij0_TX2YAl5S2dKsmHd6PFJ7wsprtcPFxarFr3uLQKgcTCM0gjOomP6czlevjhyEXR4_4gk49j76VrDjTAajnx26wN_u1Nn6P4XdKXJeRCtx94FjXTo1fZL6EjSJ8CCaPiWi9Md/w400-h225/Turtle%20WoW%20Eastern%20Kingdoms%20loading%20screen%20with%20high%20elf.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>At one point when I got tired of dying constantly due to my low level, I ran towards what looked like the local docks on the map, and jumped onto the first boat that arrived to take me somewhere else, anywhere else. I ended up in Auberdine, and found that someone had pitched a tent outside the inn. I had heard about these, so I stood under it, and within the course of five minutes or so, I saw my rested XP shoot up by about half a level. While I soon hearthed back home, that restedness helped me to finally catch up a bit in levels, so thanks, anonymous tent-builder.</p><p>This seems like a good point to mention community. Again, this is something that I\'d heard a lot of praise for before, so I was admittedly a bit confused when for my first few levels I couldn\'t get anyone to talk to me. By that I mean that people would group up for a quest and cooperate, but I would literally get zero reply to anything I said. I was starting to wonder whether there was some hidden chat restriction for low-level characters or something. I think I was around level 9 when a friendly mage finally talked to me while we briefly grouped up for a quest to kill murlocs. They even offered to continue questing together, but unfortunately I had to log off just after that. The only other verbal interaction I\'ve had since then was some random whispering me to compliment me on my "thicc elf booty". All in all, I would rate that as similar to playing on a Blizzard PvE server before they merged everything into the mega servers - neither notably better nor worse. But then, you can\'t really have a non-megaserver experience in most of the official Classic versions anymore, so...</p><p>After I\'d completed all the quests in Thalassian Highlands (as far as I could tell), I tried to do some research on what else might be interesting to check out, whether there was another custom zone I could go to at my level. As it turns out, there aren\'t actually as many of them as one might have expected after all the hype, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/turtlewow/comments/1mah0le/my_personal_tierlist_of_turtlwows_added_zones/">Thalassian Highlands is supposed to be one of the better ones</a>.

I\'m sure I\'m not the only one who immediately wondered whether this is going to be another Nostalrius situation.</p><p>But let\'s back up for a second for anyone who might be confused by what some or all of that means. To recap, Nostalrius was an incredibly popular Vanilla WoW private server that was active for a year from early 2015 to 2016. It purported to be not for profit and claimed to offer the most authentic recreation of Vanilla WoW out there. Despite its very short lifespan, it managed to attract an incredible amount of interest within that year, to the point that even mainstream media were starting to report on it. Blizzard eventually sent them a cease and desist, but also ended up inviting the developers over to their headquarters, and it\'s widely believed that the whole incident was what convinced Blizzard that there was a valid business case for them to release their own Classic servers, as <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2017/11/blizzcon-news-official-vanilla-servers.html">they announced WoW Classic at BlizzCon the following year</a>.</p><p>(I myself never played on the original Nostalrius, but I played on its direct competitor Kronos. Vanilla WoW was definitely "in the air" around that time, with the disappointing Warlords of Draenor making many yearn for the good old days.)</p><p>The initial release of WoW Classic took a sledgehammer to the private server scene, because most people were happy to just pay for easy access to the "real" thing.

Because while there are many versions of it, at the same time they haven\'t necessarily been what (at least some) people wanted. Players were given a chance to play Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King, and then these expansions were taken away from them again, so if either of these was what you <i>really</i> wanted out of WoW Classic, it was back to private servers for you. Season of Discovery was off to an incredibly strong start with the promise of offering "Vanilla with a twist" and then lost steam hard in its subsequent phases, just to end up in an awkward state of abandonment now, with no more active development planned.</p><p>People keep clamouring for "Classic Plus", a version of Vanilla WoW that should be permanent and receive continued active development like retail, but stay true to Vanilla somehow, even though you won\'t be able to find two people who agree on what exactly that means. In fairness, Blizzard has sent out more than one <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/07/that-classic-plus-survey.html">survey</a> seemingly trying to find out what such a version of WoW could look like, but personally I\'m still not convinced that they are really working on a permanent Classic+ as opposed to just the next seasonal server.</p><p>Either way, the point is that there is once again a gap in Blizzard\'s offerings that private servers have been happy to fill, and one of the most popular of these has been <a href="https://turtle-wow.org/">Turtle WoW</a>.

This is in contrast to how with Blizzard, everything always seems to circle back to raiding, endgame and adding even more powerful gear.

In a time when big companies are constantly outsourcing and reducing staff with "soft skills", such as social media or customer service teams, Turtle WoW had a reputation for having actual human GMs and good moderation. I even heard complaints that their moderation was "too strict", which to me to be honest sounded like a <i>good</i> thing in the context of MMO general chat channels.</p><p>This is not to say that Turtle WoW was perfect or anything - what I heard about their cash shop sounded quite off-putting to me (you could buy bags, "transmog" and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7MyTj24hUE">garish mounts</a>&nbsp;to an extent that puts retail WoW to shame), but to be honest I was still kind of glad the project was there as a signal to Blizzard that there are people who care about things they don\'t currently offer.</p><p>With this lawsuit, it seems unlikely that Turtle WoW will survive for very long - while it\'s not impossible for a for-profit private server to continue operating in the face of legal threats if they route all their activities through just the right countries (<a href="https://www.warmane.com/">Warmane</a> has infamously been in operation for over a decade), I\'m not sure the Turtle WoW team has what it takes to continue evading the law, especially as the details of the lawsuit seem to show that the owners have already been identified and tracked down in real life.</p><p>I think the best we can hope for is that the situation will create sufficient amounts of attention and community outcry to make Blizzard think hard about what it is that\'s missing from Classic right now to the extent that hundreds of thousands of people would rather sign up for and download a private server client than play their product.&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>I was going to start my day doing something else today, but then I came across a hot bit of gossip late last night that I just had to write about first: that <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71235075/1/blizzard-entertainment-inc-v-turtle-wow/">Blizzard is suing Turtle WoW</a>.

I even heard complaints that their moderation was "too strict", which to me to be honest sounded like a <i>good</i> thing in the context of MMO general chat channels.</p><p>This is not to say that Turtle WoW was perfect or anything - what I heard about their cash shop sounded quite off-putting to me (you could buy bags, "transmog" and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7MyTj24hUE">garish mounts</a>&nbsp;to an extent that puts retail WoW to shame), but to be honest I was still kind of glad the project was there as a signal to Blizzard that there are people who care about things they don\'t currently offer.</p><p>With this lawsuit, it seems unlikely that Turtle WoW will survive for very long - while it\'s not impossible for a for-profit private server to continue operating in the face of legal threats if they route all their activities through just the right countries (<a href="https://www.warmane.com/">Warmane</a> has infamously been in operation for over a decade), I\'m not sure the Turtle WoW team has what it takes to continue evading the law, especially as the details of the lawsuit seem to show that the owners have already been identified and tracked down in real life.</p><p>I think the best we can hope for is that the situation will create sufficient amounts of attention and community outcry to make Blizzard think hard about what it is that\'s missing from Classic right now to the extent that hundreds of thousands of people would rather sign up for and download a private server client than play their product.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/08/could-turtle-wow-be-catalyst-for-classic.html'}], 'link': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/08/could-turtle-wow-be-catalyst-for-classic.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhU_XkofuOPTvFlrJnC0kJukXLpBORkChA0M_prq9q0jERUXLw7DK3a0RqW0z1F4KPgvDTp1pgoS2pb4PWUXoce3fuSmcmNBB3pst7rX_UWJb5uQxQNva94lcY8TXnkRrxeF2eeXcH5Ju-Yhc5WbPjnVQ4r-NgGq6KJU3nMXIT0tQgzPoLCJux7E6vT-Bdh/s72-w400-h400-c/Turtle%20WoW%20logo.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '5'}

In the past, even if players hated a trailer for what it conveyed, it was pretty much universally agreed that it was still impeccably animated at least. Not with this one! I don\'t think all the criticisms are necessarily equally valid, but let\'s just say that after people pointed out that Liadrin in this looks more like the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:High_Elf_Hero">Elven Hero from Elder Scrolls Online</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauriel">Tauriel from the Hobbit movies</a> than a Warcraft elf, I haven\'t been able to unsee that.</p><p>After comparing to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJr3dXZfcg">Battle for Azeroth trailer</a> (which does feature a similar situation including a city siege), I also found it noticeable how many unique characters were featured in the BfA cinematic - while Sylvanas and Anduin are the focus, we also get shots of Saurfang, Zekhan and Greymane, as well as a number of different "generic units", from undead archers to dwarven riflemen. In the Midnight trailer, we have exactly three focus characters and everyone else is an indistinguishable melee soldier covered from head to toe in armour like they are a bunch of stormtroopers, which I hadn\'t really picked out before.</p><p>I think the biggest thing though is that the pacing/scripting feels slightly off and fails to reach a proper climax. I\'d say it\'s fine for most of the cinematic actually, but when Liadrin returns with the help from the Sunwell it ends too quickly without letting us fully feel the triumph, while also just getting plain confusing because the help are also just a bunch of armoured mooks. I\'ve looked around online and even the most passionate lore nerds are unsure of who these are actually supposed to be (though there are seemingly a million theories, from <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=86659/guardian-of-ancient-kings">Guardians of the Ancient Kings</a> to the <a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_the_Light">Army of Light</a> to the Arathi to representations of us, the players).</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22Nf00VN0WM">gameplay reveals</a> suffered from a similar mix of "well, we knew that was coming" and muddled messaging. Yes, housing is a big deal, but we\'ve known about that <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/11/warcraft-direct-mop-classic-fresh.html">for almost a year</a>, and there\'s been a constant <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/06/retail-bits-bobs.html">drip-feed of more details</a> since then. You can\'t expect people to suddenly gasp and be super-excited about hearing the exact same thing again.</p><p>I also used to think it was kind of funny how they\'d include things like "level cap increase" or "new dungeons" as major expansion features to be excited about, but this time they didn\'t and it was actually kind of confusing. I saw people ask questions like "Will there actually be a level increase this time?" (yes) and only later found out all kinds of interesting stuff that they didn\'t actually put into the features trailer, such as that <a href="https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Valeera_Sanguinar">Valeera Sanguinar</a> will be the new delve companion or the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/players-will-save-thousands-of-gold-in-midnight-with-free-transmogging-378217">major changes coming to transmog</a> (huge!).</p><p>My personal takeaway is simply that Midnight will continue the War Within, which was kind of what we knew was going to happen.

I\'ve looked around online and even the most passionate lore nerds are unsure of who these are actually supposed to be (though there are seemingly a million theories, from <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=86659/guardian-of-ancient-kings">Guardians of the Ancient Kings</a> to the <a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_the_Light">Army of Light</a> to the Arathi to representations of us, the players).</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22Nf00VN0WM">gameplay reveals</a> suffered from a similar mix of "well, we knew that was coming" and muddled messaging. Yes, housing is a big deal, but we\'ve known about that <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/11/warcraft-direct-mop-classic-fresh.html">for almost a year</a>, and there\'s been a constant <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/06/retail-bits-bobs.html">drip-feed of more details</a> since then. You can\'t expect people to suddenly gasp and be super-excited about hearing the exact same thing again.</p><p>I also used to think it was kind of funny how they\'d include things like "level cap increase" or "new dungeons" as major expansion features to be excited about, but this time they didn\'t and it was actually kind of confusing. I saw people ask questions like "Will there actually be a level increase this time?" (yes) and only later found out all kinds of interesting stuff that they didn\'t actually put into the features trailer, such as that <a href="https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Valeera_Sanguinar">Valeera Sanguinar</a> will be the new delve companion or the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/players-will-save-thousands-of-gold-in-midnight-with-free-transmogging-378217">major changes coming to transmog</a> (huge!).</p><p>My personal takeaway is simply that Midnight will continue the War Within, which was kind of what we knew was going to happen. I\'ll be happy to buy it because I\'m enjoying my time in retail right now, but I\'m not sure it really delivered in the hype department the way these expansion announcements are usually expected to.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-midnight-expansion-reveal.html'}], 'link': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-midnight-expansion-reveal.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://img.youtube.com/vi/SiIjThwKLaE/default.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '12'}

We met the Haranir, who also seemed to have a connection to Azeroth itself and were worried about corrupting influences.

I saw someone comment that they liked how the buff "brought people out into the world again" and my first thought was that this sounded ridiculous, seeing how the whole point of it was to farm for drops inside instances. But as I started travelling to different locations myself, I realised what that person had meant: many of these destinations were not exactly linked up to super-convenient portals, so there was sometimes a fair bit of travel involved, and you would indeed notice other people around you as you approached the instance portal, whether they were also just arriving or sitting on their vendor mount outside to clear out their bags.</p><p>For me personally, it was a bit of a reminder of why travel in WoW was such an important part of Classic and can still make a difference to your experience in retail too. You see, I was also going to fly to the Eye of Eternity for a quick clear when I flew over Wintergrasp and saw that it was about to start. Not having done Wintergrasp in ages, I thought it would be fun to join it for a lark just to see how much I remembered and how much I could do by myself as a max-level character. The surprising answer to the second question was: not as much as I would\'ve expected, as everything was actually scaled to 80.</p><p>However, now I was intrigued and actually ended up coming back for the next battle, to see whether I could do better with a bit of prep. The answer was yes, but I still couldn\'t quite reach the central keep by myself (Horde seemed to be permanently in possession of the fortress, meaning all I could do as Alliance was attack). I told my husband about this and asked him whether he wanted to come along so we could see whether we\'d do better with two, and he was up for it! We did indeed make some more progress, but still came up short once again (the fact that a Horde player was actually going around taking down all the towers to shorten the battle that time didn\'t help). After a little more research and planning we finally managed to conquer the fortress with the two of us in our fourth battle. It was silly and pointless but an incredibly fun little adventure, and I never even would\'ve thought of it if I hadn\'t flown over Wintergrasp at just the right time on my way to the Eye of Eternity.

The mechanic that requires you to kick bombs into the adds is just extremely clunky, as it\'s literally impossible to mouse-target them sometimes due to boss and camera positioning, meaning you <i>had</i> to enable the "interact key" to be able to kick blindly sometimes, and even then - well, it\'s right there in the last sentence, kicking the things around blindly was not very satisfying or fun.</p><p>Nonetheless, all in all I still enjoyed this encounter as well, and I\'ve now made it my new goal to at least do the normal mode on all classes again, like I tried to do with Zekvir. I do kind of have to wonder how sustainable this "delve challenge boss" model is going to be in the long run though. I mean, isn\'t it bound to get kind of repetitive? I suppose you could say the same about raids, but at least there you have different roles and a much larger number of players to mix things up mechanically, while any fight that\'s meant to be something to do for solo players of any class is by necessity always going to be much more limited in terms of what it can demand.&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>Towards the end of War Within season one, I made a whole post about <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/02/zekvirs-lair.html">my journey into Zekvir\'s Lair</a>, from being largely oblivious to what it was all about to finally beating him on double question mark difficulty.

The mechanic that requires you to kick bombs into the adds is just extremely clunky, as it\'s literally impossible to mouse-target them sometimes due to boss and camera positioning, meaning you <i>had</i> to enable the "interact key" to be able to kick blindly sometimes, and even then - well, it\'s right there in the last sentence, kicking the things around blindly was not very satisfying or fun.</p><p>Nonetheless, all in all I still enjoyed this encounter as well, and I\'ve now made it my new goal to at least do the normal mode on all classes again, like I tried to do with Zekvir. I do kind of have to wonder how sustainable this "delve challenge boss" model is going to be in the long run though. I mean, isn\'t it bound to get kind of repetitive? I suppose you could say the same about raids, but at least there you have different roles and a much larger number of players to mix things up mechanically, while any fight that\'s meant to be something to do for solo players of any class is by necessity always going to be much more limited in terms of what it can demand.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/07/comparing-zekvir-and-underpin.html'}], 'link': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/07/comparing-zekvir-and-underpin.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://img.youtube.com/vi/AmQ0b9daBU0/default.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '6'}

I was getting ready to struggle, but to my surprise all the enemies in the Lich King story <i>still</i> seemed to be made of cardboard and continued to die in one or two hits, even in Halls of Reflection. It was only at this point that I noticed that I was actually immune to all damage (though my poor pet wasn\'t and paid the price multiple times). I can\'t quite tell whether this was intended or just a temporary fix for a scaling problem as I found some complaints from people who had done the chain closer to its release, saying that the mobs were hitting too hard and killing them.</p><p>In the Ethereal story I <i>wasn\'t</i> immune to damage, though my damage taken still seemed pretty mild - until I walked off the beaten path during the bit on Argus and decided to attack a star mob, which - while nominally also scaled to my level - hit literally ten times as hard as any of the other enemies and killed me in four hits. So... I\'m not really sure what\'s going on there or even what\'s&nbsp;<i>supposed</i> to be going on.</p><p>I <i>will</i> say that the damage immunity in the Lich King story makes that particular bit of Lorewalking an excellent way out if you ever find yourself stuck in outdated gear and unable to quest due to the curse of scaling, as the damage immunity inside the story will protect you and you\'ll get several level-appropriate gear rewards along the way. My blood elf hunter for example gained a little less than two levels but her item level increased from 10 to 43. The other stories don\'t work the same way though - as mentioned, I wasn\'t immune to damage doing the Ethereal story and while I gained almost four levels in that one, I was given only a couple of pieces of gear during that time.</p><p>Anyway, I\'m curious to see whether Blizzard will add more stories to this feature as time goes on. I\'d quite like that, because even for the bits of lore you already do know, it can serve as a nice refresher. That said, let\'s be clear that this in no way solves the problem of new and returning players being unable to tell what\'s going on and struggling to connect to the world in general. For that, it\'s simply too limited in scope and too passive (sit here and listen to me tell you stories about other people instead of getting to know the world on your own).</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>Retail WoW is going a bit crazy with the new content at the moment in my opinion.

I\'m not really sure what\'s going on there or even what\'s&nbsp;<i>supposed</i> to be going on.</p><p>I <i>will</i> say that the damage immunity in the Lich King story makes that particular bit of Lorewalking an excellent way out if you ever find yourself stuck in outdated gear and unable to quest due to the curse of scaling, as the damage immunity inside the story will protect you and you\'ll get several level-appropriate gear rewards along the way. My blood elf hunter for example gained a little less than two levels but her item level increased from 10 to 43. The other stories don\'t work the same way though - as mentioned, I wasn\'t immune to damage doing the Ethereal story and while I gained almost four levels in that one, I was given only a couple of pieces of gear during that time.</p><p>Anyway, I\'m curious to see whether Blizzard will add more stories to this feature as time goes on. I\'d quite like that, because even for the bits of lore you already do know, it can serve as a nice refresher. That said, let\'s be clear that this in no way solves the problem of new and returning players being unable to tell what\'s going on and struggling to connect to the world in general. For that, it\'s simply too limited in scope and too passive (sit here and listen to me tell you stories about other people instead of getting to know the world on your own).</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/07/lorewalking-impressions.html'}], 'link': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/07/lorewalking-impressions.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPKiB9L0xBVkOxrmmJ498na18AWZfjFBvtu2FcJ5KHHUucrl3JbD5a69RYP0TvlJVMY2nPH1j0P5NQcFVMsBuABSCAic2D7LU4mQE3vx0xKs275V138xY1WoPJn155bu-bwZT33KpI2Ik01Q5L_MtuTZ6hQ-3Q8FO3FlRYXUAhA7tPMw83jsCRQm0j5Cu8/s72-w400-h225-c/Lorewalking%20as%20Arthas.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

I wasn\'t particularly excited about it, but I couldn\'t help but notice some changes as I logged into my hunter to do the daily cooking quest (like I said before, the profession dailies were easily one of my favourite things about Cata, so I\'m still doing those until I max out my cooking and get the achievement for completing all the variations in all three capitals).&nbsp;</p><p>The new talents were there, which I didn\'t particularly like in original MoP and still don\'t like now. Most notably though, my bow was in my bags and my hunter only had her staff equipped. Re-equipping the bow resulted in the staff going back into the bag instead.</p><p>Ah yes, remember <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/06/cata-classic-halfway-there.html">how I said last month</a> that one of the things I was enjoying about Cata was that hunters could still wield both a ranged and a melee weapon? R.I.P. to that particular class fantasy; I just never realised that this was a change that happened in MoP.</p><p>It actually made me realise that class fantasy aside, it\'s really kind of bizarre how Blizzard handled this. Survival didn\'t become a melee spec until Legion, so why would you let hunters equip a melee weapon only and then have them be locked out of using every single one of their combat abilities? Talk about a giant noob trap.</p><p>In fact, this is something that\'s still confusing in retail as I noticed the other day when I rolled up a survival hunter, because you still start with a ranged weapon and then when you hit level 10 and spec survival, you initially have like... one ability you can actually use, with everything else suddenly greyed out. It just feels terrible. Also, I only found out at that point that retail hunters no longer start with a pet for some reason? But you don\'t get a quest to tame one either, so... I have no idea how new players are supposed to figure this shit out. Anyway, I digress.</p><p>I had also logged into my feral druid briefly before the patch, to make the boat ride to Valgarde now that I\'d remembered where to get on the right boat. Checking on her after the pre-patch, I was dismayed to be reminded that MoP was also when they did away with the whole notion of being a bear-cat, as feral was split into new feral (cat only) and guardian (bear only). I hadn\'t realised just how many gameplay changes that I didn\'t like actually came about in Mists of Pandaria. Both Wrath and Cata did things that I felt at least ambivalent about at the time, meaning I saw both pros and cons to them, but it seems MoP was when stuff got <i>really</i> bad, considering how many of its gameplay changes are triggering a pure "oh yeah, I remember hating that" response in me.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfd2swjYuTw3lkYxLtM92IrH4tSJCJlW6CuuXRHkOqY7jGNWT7Xb6wG4_IqUTUSS5Z3AC3Bd6L_kpYHKUGyhUIA34Si0Du9suMfZJDKaSBKki7Liw5fJtpXE_Pdy5ZrUR_yPMQICzCkQAfk-sZ4jIWnTq7FQ1rlOtdaYDKPYsUfVGOaOTUaMM-vE22NPMk/s1920/Faly%20sailing%20into%20Howling%20Fjord%20under%20the%20burning%20ship.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female night elf druid riding the boat to Valgarde in Howling Fjord.

I also thought it would be interesting to do it as a monk this time, since I didn\'t create my first monk until BfA and therefore had no idea how different the class was going to be in its initial iteration.</p><p>The first difference was in fact immediate and very noticeable as my first ability was a move called "<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=108557/jab">Jab</a>" that actually hit my opponent with my staff, which I thought was delightful. In retail, monks don\'t use their weapons for anything, ever (which also makes the first Pandaren quest, which asks you to pick up a weapon and show that you can use it, quite nonsensical).</p><p>I made it to about level five, slowly jabbing things to death, when it occurred to me that while the Wandering Isle was very pretty, it was also quite boring to hit things to death so slowly. It was only then that I realised - oh right, we\'re in MoP, where you learn new abilities automatically and I guess they don\'t even show up on my bar? (<a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2014/01/why-i-think-mop-character-levelling-is.html">Looking back</a>, they <i>did</i> used to go on your bar in original MoP if there was space, so maybe this is just a bug.) Checking my spell book actually revealed new abilities I hadn\'t even realised I had access to, and that sped things up considerably, even if it was very weird to me to see <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=100787/tiger-palm">Tiger Palm</a> be a Chi spender instead of builder, which is the polar opposite of how it works in retail.</p><p>I was kind of surprised by how busy the island was, because on a lark, I had decided to create this "throwaway panda" on Hydraxian Waterlords, my old RP server home. Even though it was soft-merged into the regular PvE servers back in Classic BC and was meant to be closed down entirely in the run-up to Wrath, it\'s somehow still there, not just not closed, but not even locked for new character creation like most of the other old servers are. I figured it was going to be more pleasant to level in this more quiet environment without too much competition for mobs, so still seeing ~40 characters in the zone every time I played was a surprise.</p><p>When I got to Stormwind on the other hand, there were only about ten people there, and the auction house looked mostly empty. I wonder if there are any genuine holdouts still playing on this server or if it was mostly players like me who decided that levelling a throwaway character was more pleasant to do in a low pop environment.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5JSi2mqnCWKLpmuoprpVVUvMzD-k-gBd2erLibUQ_sJxtvy_s1x5VfucnyE57XZHHm2vWmQq6gNOoj3QZ1T2Vz9c6hzQP-rbakaARR38d4_eNjaiu_ITKlL06_pC-IAQgwX3vxqiIS8WeHOzHy_4rhCMo_u3pWqFBSgHCYvb9CDANrzGJc4OaZKBlyt3a/s1920/Leaving%20the%20Wandering%20Isle%20by%20balloon.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A hot air balloon flying away from Shen-zin Su, the giant turtle carrying the Wandering Isle." border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5JSi2mqnCWKLpmuoprpVVUvMzD-k-gBd2erLibUQ_sJxtvy_s1x5VfucnyE57XZHHm2vWmQq6gNOoj3QZ1T2Vz9c6hzQP-rbakaARR38d4_eNjaiu_ITKlL06_pC-IAQgwX3vxqiIS8WeHOzHy_4rhCMo_u3pWqFBSgHCYvb9CDANrzGJc4OaZKBlyt3a/w400-h225/Leaving%20the%20Wandering%20Isle%20by%20balloon.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>But I\'m getting ahead of myself. Completing the storyline on the Wandering Isle, it was still a bit too linear for my personal taste, with a lot of running about, but overall pleasant. It\'s probably a better "island introduction" to the game than Exile\'s Reach to be honest. I was kind of surprised by how emotional the ending still made me.</p><p>The Alliance intro for Pandaren was new to me and was actually pretty funny! You meet with King Varian and he lectures you a bit about what it means to join the Alliance, but finishes by asking you to spar with him, because he\'s curious about the Pandaren fighting style. Now, when this duel starts, he has a buff that gives him 100% dodge chance, so all your attacks miss and he taunts you about it. Until... one hit suddenly goes through, and you get this slow-motion cut scene of him falling backwards and your companions looking absolutely horrified that you just punched the king of Stormwind, which I thought was hilarious. He just laughs it off and simply wanders off afterwards.</p><p>Anyway, with my free mount claimed and nothing else about the pre-patch looking particularly appealing, I\'ll probably coast by just doing those cooking dailies until the expansion releases properly and I can start my journey to the Vale. Though probably even that will have to wait at least a week or two, as I have no particular desire to compete with the launch day crowds.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3EY_Hli-ybNWTBc9PUHINu5x_DBlx8CAWiFKOpGl0qwRSzSMapp64a-Z83JB71RGMRqYxbhyhOZmmVaeITxL4kEvjhLzKLP459UFhxwmQg2hfAwybAzw29AWoSNGNxMhsvvZ8Z3pWvr2XBBa-K3wW720NF7fO-fDCvX4w6InELsyZTHPVsFYFjq1HdA3r/s1920/HW%20Shinfur%20running%20across%20the%20Wandering%20Isle.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female pandaren monk running across the Wandering Isle.

Now, when this duel starts, he has a buff that gives him 100% dodge chance, so all your attacks miss and he taunts you about it. Until... one hit suddenly goes through, and you get this slow-motion cut scene of him falling backwards and your companions looking absolutely horrified that you just punched the king of Stormwind, which I thought was hilarious. He just laughs it off and simply wanders off afterwards.</p><p>Anyway, with my free mount claimed and nothing else about the pre-patch looking particularly appealing, I\'ll probably coast by just doing those cooking dailies until the expansion releases properly and I can start my journey to the Vale. Though probably even that will have to wait at least a week or two, as I have no particular desire to compete with the launch day crowds.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/07/mop-pre-patch-impressions.html'}], 'link': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/07/mop-pre-patch-impressions.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3EY_Hli-ybNWTBc9PUHINu5x_DBlx8CAWiFKOpGl0qwRSzSMapp64a-Z83JB71RGMRqYxbhyhOZmmVaeITxL4kEvjhLzKLP459UFhxwmQg2hfAwybAzw29AWoSNGNxMhsvvZ8Z3pWvr2XBBa-K3wW720NF7fO-fDCvX4w6InELsyZTHPVsFYFjq1HdA3r/s72-w400-h225-c/HW%20Shinfur%20running%20across%20the%20Wandering%20Isle.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '7'}

This time around, the first few quests felt pleasantly familiar and nostalgic. Back in original Cataclysm, mounts were not account-wide yet, so I had to do at least the first hub and a bit on every alt in order to earn my underwater breathing buff and seahorse mount to be able to navigate the zone.</p><p>As I continued deeper into the zone, my memories became fuzzier and I realised that there were some bits I barely remembered at all, such as the whole Nespirah chain. However, by the halfway point or so things definitely started to drag again this time too. I got the "2000 quests completed" achievement at some point and it struck me that almost 10% of those quests took place in this one zone alone, which is insane.</p><p>There\'s nothing wrong with any of the quests by themselves (and the Battlemaiden chain provides nice insights into the world of the naga), but it\'s just the fact that you have to go through almost 200 of them in a strictly linear chain just to cover a plot that can be summed up in two sentences. The same story could have been told in less than half the number of quests; there\'s just way too much "kill 15 naga" filler.</p><p>It\'s funny because at the time, I didn\'t think Cataclysm questing was <i>that</i> bad, but having revisited several older expansions in recent years it seems undeniable to me that Cata was an absolute low point in terms of questing. Mists of Pandaria was a noticeable step up again, but even BC and Wrath have aged better than Cata - in my opinion at least.</p><p>Gear progression was another interesting thing to observe. I\'d started my journey in mostly tier five from BC and only replaced a few pieces of that while levelling through Northrend, and for very marginal upgrades at that. And then I started doing quests in Vashj\'ir and the starts on the green quest rewards just went through the roof. By the end of level 83, after questing in Vashj\'ir for a while, my health had nearly doubled compared to what it had been at level 82.</p><p>Finishing all of Vashj\'ir got me most of the way to level 85. For the rest, I did the introductory quests to the other four Cataclysm endgame zones to unlock all the portals in Stormwind, as well as a bunch of cooking and fishing dailies. (I\'d forgotten how much I used to <i>love</i> those in Cata.) At some point the Midsummer Festival also started, adding more supplementary XP from bonfire visits and torch tossing dailies.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsG6sOItTD5mXNMFDgR1NW7Rz-sgr1EguzyjuLZfbbrXzo6r0daOWqTaDZdZUhKAvMcc2zUyNvC-fBOOKW8VnGDzXlrdeOhyTkTlAH5Yio1mou8JKji9Dw0A-M01bZus4vnVnts3aYys7FtYnYCWt92ZEvIs8pBySGTjWKrIKMWjlkZ_yQBRG2d28Uw9az/s1920/Tiirr%20standing%20in%20fire%20in%20Uldum.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female night elf hunter and her pet lynx surrounded by flames" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsG6sOItTD5mXNMFDgR1NW7Rz-sgr1EguzyjuLZfbbrXzo6r0daOWqTaDZdZUhKAvMcc2zUyNvC-fBOOKW8VnGDzXlrdeOhyTkTlAH5Yio1mou8JKji9Dw0A-M01bZus4vnVnts3aYys7FtYnYCWt92ZEvIs8pBySGTjWKrIKMWjlkZ_yQBRG2d28Uw9az/w400-h225/Tiirr%20standing%20in%20fire%20in%20Uldum.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><i>I also got the "Stood in the Fire" achievement while doing the Uldum intro thanks to Deathwing paying the zone a visit.&nbsp;</i></p><p>I was surprised to see the Darkmoon Faire return after only two weeks, but then I recalled reading somewhere that Blizzard increased the frequency of its visits in Classic due to the sped up expansion schedule compared to the game\'s original run.</p><p>I even paused to do a bit of archaeology when I found myself flying past dig sites.

I got the "2000 quests completed" achievement at some point and it struck me that almost 10% of those quests took place in this one zone alone, which is insane.</p><p>There\'s nothing wrong with any of the quests by themselves (and the Battlemaiden chain provides nice insights into the world of the naga), but it\'s just the fact that you have to go through almost 200 of them in a strictly linear chain just to cover a plot that can be summed up in two sentences. The same story could have been told in less than half the number of quests; there\'s just way too much "kill 15 naga" filler.</p><p>It\'s funny because at the time, I didn\'t think Cataclysm questing was <i>that</i> bad, but having revisited several older expansions in recent years it seems undeniable to me that Cata was an absolute low point in terms of questing. Mists of Pandaria was a noticeable step up again, but even BC and Wrath have aged better than Cata - in my opinion at least.</p><p>Gear progression was another interesting thing to observe. I\'d started my journey in mostly tier five from BC and only replaced a few pieces of that while levelling through Northrend, and for very marginal upgrades at that. And then I started doing quests in Vashj\'ir and the starts on the green quest rewards just went through the roof. By the end of level 83, after questing in Vashj\'ir for a while, my health had nearly doubled compared to what it had been at level 82.</p><p>Finishing all of Vashj\'ir got me most of the way to level 85. For the rest, I did the introductory quests to the other four Cataclysm endgame zones to unlock all the portals in Stormwind, as well as a bunch of cooking and fishing dailies. (I\'d forgotten how much I used to <i>love</i> those in Cata.) At some point the Midsummer Festival also started, adding more supplementary XP from bonfire visits and torch tossing dailies.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsG6sOItTD5mXNMFDgR1NW7Rz-sgr1EguzyjuLZfbbrXzo6r0daOWqTaDZdZUhKAvMcc2zUyNvC-fBOOKW8VnGDzXlrdeOhyTkTlAH5Yio1mou8JKji9Dw0A-M01bZus4vnVnts3aYys7FtYnYCWt92ZEvIs8pBySGTjWKrIKMWjlkZ_yQBRG2d28Uw9az/s1920/Tiirr%20standing%20in%20fire%20in%20Uldum.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female night elf hunter and her pet lynx surrounded by flames" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsG6sOItTD5mXNMFDgR1NW7Rz-sgr1EguzyjuLZfbbrXzo6r0daOWqTaDZdZUhKAvMcc2zUyNvC-fBOOKW8VnGDzXlrdeOhyTkTlAH5Yio1mou8JKji9Dw0A-M01bZus4vnVnts3aYys7FtYnYCWt92ZEvIs8pBySGTjWKrIKMWjlkZ_yQBRG2d28Uw9az/w400-h225/Tiirr%20standing%20in%20fire%20in%20Uldum.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><i>I also got the "Stood in the Fire" achievement while doing the Uldum intro thanks to Deathwing paying the zone a visit.&nbsp;</i></p><p>I was surprised to see the Darkmoon Faire return after only two weeks, but then I recalled reading somewhere that Blizzard increased the frequency of its visits in Classic due to the sped up expansion schedule compared to the game\'s original run.</p><p>I even paused to do a bit of archaeology when I found myself flying past dig sites. I was surprised how good they were for XP and pleased to see that Blizz had already increased their yield a bit to five fragments or more per unearthed relic - I vividly recall that when archaeology was first added, you only got about three to four pieces per successful survey.</p><p>Now my plan is to perhaps continue doing the cooking and fishing dailies as well as possibly level my leartherworking some more. I\'m not planning to dive into Pandaria the moment it launches as I expect things to be very crowded and I\'d rather avoid all the mayhem tied to that. With my modest goal of wanting to see the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, I should have plenty of time to get there at my own pace, as long as I do so before the release of the later patches.</p><p>I\'ve got to admit I found myself wondering why I still care so much about this night elf hunter. Sure, part of it are the fond memories I made with her during Vanilla Classic, and another part is that I simply <i>enjoy</i> things like levelling professions, regardless of how useful it might turn out to be. However, I think at this point it\'s also that I\'m kind of hoping that eventually she\'ll be united with my warband in retail.

I\'m still dithering in Northrend as I\'m writing this because I felt like I was actually progressing a bit <i>too</i> fast and I don\'t want to move on to Cata just yet. It\'s one of those flaws with the way WoW does expansion content, that because of how much of it is concentrated at the level cap, when the level cap moves up, it requires a lot of effort to actually still take any of that content in because you\'ll just be sailing past it way too quickly.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZdGiPZvi6k9ZOvpTBpAMcMTxVitM0hb4Ps1TNAfckK6UnCIGEoouwAyOR_kJRP41Ro-9e18HNnkl5jvruDWhgQev75PrSeBq0iffObgNHO3lg4YaVTaqWF1tdjqQzVWX4OuXTahCfjwclxL5yBDeZE6AU8uo67Haw0bOgMi4zmlKE4Ptwu5KEvdNunnmN/s1920/Tiir%20Ding%2080.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Tiirr the night elf hunter triggers the level 80 achievement during a run of Utgarde Pinnacle" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZdGiPZvi6k9ZOvpTBpAMcMTxVitM0hb4Ps1TNAfckK6UnCIGEoouwAyOR_kJRP41Ro-9e18HNnkl5jvruDWhgQev75PrSeBq0iffObgNHO3lg4YaVTaqWF1tdjqQzVWX4OuXTahCfjwclxL5yBDeZE6AU8uo67Haw0bOgMi4zmlKE4Ptwu5KEvdNunnmN/w400-h225/Tiir%20Ding%2080.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The gameplay has been surprisingly enjoyable. For as much as Cata removed a lot of what made everything that came before feel "classic", there are still bits of flavour left in there that are now missing in retail, such as my hunter wielding both a melee and a ranged weapon. I always thought that was incredibly cool, even if I didn\'t use the melee weapon much - but shooting things with a bow from point blank range like you have to do in retail just feels dumb. My pet\'s AI also feels much better for some reason, with my pet actually reappearing reliably when I dismount (in retail I feel like I have to manually re-summon it every five minutes) and defensive stance working much more smoothly than the annoying split between assist and defensive that they introduced later and which makes your pet unresponsive at the most annoying times.</p><p>In general it\'s noticeable how damage rotations are still in a kind of sweet spot where they are more involved than Vanilla (requiring you to use, say, five different damage abilities instead of just one) but don\'t have all the annoying upkeep of buffs or temporary cooldowns that you\'re supposed to cycle through constantly in retail.</p><p>Not everything is great of course. After the War Within just made massive improvements to the way the game handles transmog collection, it\'s almost physically painful to be back to a system where collecting any appearances and even merely keeping track of what you\'ve already got is strictly tied to your class and armour type.</p><p>Last week was also Darkmoon Faire week, so I hopped onto Darkmoon Island to do the rounds there like I do in retail. Since the Island was introduced in Cata, I didn\'t expect to notice many differences, but I was quite surprised. For example I had forgotten that there was originally no return portal, and the targeting circle for the "Target: Turtle" game was huge and incredibly inaccurate for some reason, making it feel much more difficult than in retail.</p><p>All that said, most of my levelling was spent in Northrend, flying around exploring the landscape, working on my professions and engaging with a quest hub here or there as the mood struck me. (As a hunter I just had to do the Nesingwary quests in Sholazar for example.) In-between I queued for dungeons - I have my gripes with Wrath, but the dungeons were pretty cool and <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2010/07/scary-statistics.html">I literally ran them hundreds of times back in the day</a>.

I won\'t get away with getting as much levelling done in dungeons in Cata, as it says I\'m currently ineligible to queue for any of them.

I figure that\'s probably an even bigger reason for why the queue for it took so long.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCR8XLA8ySMsM0jbikmLN8Hus6gXq3-byKmaaNVIqzKWHqjmbcf9rnm6KkhpH9ptNmcsqZy-xLbRcSzNMYv8lp6JqlZZcyfnmwvi_fGLWo5M_ZmNHmzmDQ70zz1esBwTwGAckttTd5okU2znlF1re5-_qK7aviqCtsPDo0j4992x228ibGjNUkyS38rScL/s1147/Cata%20dungeon%20finder%20with%20Halls%20of%20Stone%20missing.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The Wrath of the Lich King dungeon list in the dungeon finder, with Halls of Stone being conspicuously absent" border="0" height="205" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCR8XLA8ySMsM0jbikmLN8Hus6gXq3-byKmaaNVIqzKWHqjmbcf9rnm6KkhpH9ptNmcsqZy-xLbRcSzNMYv8lp6JqlZZcyfnmwvi_fGLWo5M_ZmNHmzmDQ70zz1esBwTwGAckttTd5okU2znlF1re5-_qK7aviqCtsPDo0j4992x228ibGjNUkyS38rScL/w400-h205/Cata%20dungeon%20finder%20with%20Halls%20of%20Stone%20missing.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>At 80, things got even worse as most of the level 80 dungeons I still hadn\'t done also disappeared from the list.

As an aside, I was surprised by how busy things were in Stormwind (and that\'s on a server that was flagged as having a medium population). Classic Cata is the currently live version of Classic that I\'ve been hearing the least about in terms of people actually playing it, but clearly it still has its audience. <a href="https://ironforge.pro/population/classic/">Ironforge.pro</a> has registered slightly fewer than 100k characters raiding in Cata Classic last week, which is about the same number as on the vanilla Classic anniversary servers. So for all the scoffing I\'ve seen about how Cata is where the real Classic ended and surely nobody actually wanted it, there do seem to be plenty of players who\'ve been happy to play it anyway.</p><p>Either way, my primary task was to get my bags in order. All my mounts and pets could be added to the new collections interface to no longer take up bag space. Toys were eligible too - the first time around, those didn\'t became part of collections until Warlords of Draenor, but in progressive Classic that part is already there. Likewise, the transmog interface is the one that was introduced in Legion, and the auction house is the new one that was added in Battle for Azeroth. I swear, this is going to make it harder than ever to remember which features were introduced in which expansion.</p><p>Anyway, other bag slots were freed up from selling items that had been turned into vendor trash, such as all my arrows, or things that were simply no longer relevant to a hunter in Cata, such as pet food and mana potions. One bag was filled with a bunch of random keys tied to various BC quests that I wasn\'t even on... I can only guess that those had been on my keyring when <i>that</i> was removed. Either way, more stuff to destroy. A few items, such a stacks of cloth, I decided to actually list on the AH since there were presumably still some people interested in them.</p><p>I had to visit the flight master to unlock flying in Northrend and the revamped old world. (Fortunately the ramp I was jumping off when I realised that I wouldn\'t be able to fly yet without this wasn\'t very high.) I stopped by all the profession trainers, as well as - after some initial confusion - my class trainer. (For some reason I\'d had it in my head that Cata was also the expansion where they removed the need to train abilities, but no, that actually happened in Mists.) I dragged abilities from my spell book back onto my bar and spent my pet\'s talent points.</p><p>My hunter herself had no spec either, and my first impulse was to go Marksman as usual - but then I read some of the talents and went "eurgh" - right, Cata was when I went Survival, back when that was still a ranged spec, so I opted to revisit that particular setup. Still, I was kind of surprised by how incredibly boring all the talents looked, as I seem to remember quite liking the condensed talent trees during original Cataclysm.</p><p>Finally I was ready to pick up the breadcrumb quest to Northrend. It sent me to Borean Tundra when I would\'ve preferred Howling Fjord, but in that moment I genuinely couldn\'t even remember where to board the right boat for that. So I just hopped onto the next ferry leaving Stormwind to start in the Tundra.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuxQkdBB6Ol-MloFZyRkmlLv-EjfrOREgdcGO3Dp3zcOeKzyGQtgCL8LfqpJtj4x8dTecE6Nj-Y1IYrsmLsPhFq0EIOKBAwEoNSorZzeM5tResF9OKE8FJnj0-CQGfGRg-wAhHm5UiiAjupyVGFIDxmv6lQ2Yg7NxGN5dMACP7-9J18_JqVPjmLy6H0FuS/s1920/Tiir%20riding%20the%20boat%20to%20Northrend.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female night elf hunter in mostly tier 5 gear on the boat to Northrend with her lynx pet" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuxQkdBB6Ol-MloFZyRkmlLv-EjfrOREgdcGO3Dp3zcOeKzyGQtgCL8LfqpJtj4x8dTecE6Nj-Y1IYrsmLsPhFq0EIOKBAwEoNSorZzeM5tResF9OKE8FJnj0-CQGfGRg-wAhHm5UiiAjupyVGFIDxmv6lQ2Yg7NxGN5dMACP7-9J18_JqVPjmLy6H0FuS/w400-h225/Tiir%20riding%20the%20boat%20to%20Northrend.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>I miss boats being relevant. They are slow but they really force you to immerse yourself in the world for a few minutes in a way that portals don\'t.</p><p>I decided I could be picky with which quests to do, so I only did about a third of the zone (if that) and also made a trip to Dalaran and Howling Fjord to pick up some flight paths. Unsurprisingly I suppose, this was enough to net me two levels in that single play session. The Wrath portion of the levelling curve was presumably nerfed again with the release of Cata, <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24204830/cataclysm-classic-the-joyous-journeys-50-experience-buff-is-back">there\'s another bonus XP event going on right now</a>, and I was fully rested. Still, considering I\'m not here for Northrend or the Shattering, I found the levelling speed heartening and it made the prospect of making it through the last two expansions I\'d skipped less daunting. I expect that 80-85 might still be a bit of a pain unless they nerf it with the pre-patch or something, but we\'ll see. I\'ll probably do Vashj\'ir since I haven\'t done that zone in ages... but first I need to actually make my way through Northrend.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>Back in October, in a post about <a href="https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2024/10/why-im-not-playing-as-much-classic.html">why Classic wasn\'t really vibing with me at the moment</a>, I noted the following: "If they do make a MoP Classic, I have exactly one plan for it: to level a character high enough at the start of the expansion to see the Vale of Eternal Blossoms in its original state."

This meant that my characters were server-transferred last year as part of the latest round of soft server consolidations, but other than that, my hunter Tiirr (now with two Is and two Rs) was still level 70 and sitting in Shattrath.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPbgYitVSJg-Kea3RMZi8GnlO8L92iK0T-90bYq_lzkxDT82-Gj6095PicE0_cQVPg1d9_dBBMnun_RjYBYSsfQMt4s7ee9VIoW3Wn3Xzp07lokDHTUzXQxM1iGCBqmB64RGDa8ttEU6IDbY8Gtr79TG_pUY3d04xDA6O34dQM-8QG3V1Z9e1IjsvxfxaJ/s1920/Busy%20evening%20in%20Stormwind.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The Stormwind auction house at dusk.

As an aside, I was surprised by how busy things were in Stormwind (and that\'s on a server that was flagged as having a medium population). Classic Cata is the currently live version of Classic that I\'ve been hearing the least about in terms of people actually playing it, but clearly it still has its audience. <a href="https://ironforge.pro/population/classic/">Ironforge.pro</a> has registered slightly fewer than 100k characters raiding in Cata Classic last week, which is about the same number as on the vanilla Classic anniversary servers. So for all the scoffing I\'ve seen about how Cata is where the real Classic ended and surely nobody actually wanted it, there do seem to be plenty of players who\'ve been happy to play it anyway.</p><p>Either way, my primary task was to get my bags in order. All my mounts and pets could be added to the new collections interface to no longer take up bag space. Toys were eligible too - the first time around, those didn\'t became part of collections until Warlords of Draenor, but in progressive Classic that part is already there. Likewise, the transmog interface is the one that was introduced in Legion, and the auction house is the new one that was added in Battle for Azeroth. I swear, this is going to make it harder than ever to remember which features were introduced in which expansion.</p><p>Anyway, other bag slots were freed up from selling items that had been turned into vendor trash, such as all my arrows, or things that were simply no longer relevant to a hunter in Cata, such as pet food and mana potions. One bag was filled with a bunch of random keys tied to various BC quests that I wasn\'t even on... I can only guess that those had been on my keyring when <i>that</i> was removed. Either way, more stuff to destroy. A few items, such a stacks of cloth, I decided to actually list on the AH since there were presumably still some people interested in them.</p><p>I had to visit the flight master to unlock flying in Northrend and the revamped old world. (Fortunately the ramp I was jumping off when I realised that I wouldn\'t be able to fly yet without this wasn\'t very high.) I stopped by all the profession trainers, as well as - after some initial confusion - my class trainer. (For some reason I\'d had it in my head that Cata was also the expansion where they removed the need to train abilities, but no, that actually happened in Mists.) I dragged abilities from my spell book back onto my bar and spent my pet\'s talent points.</p><p>My hunter herself had no spec either, and my first impulse was to go Marksman as usual - but then I read some of the talents and went "eurgh" - right, Cata was when I went Survival, back when that was still a ranged spec, so I opted to revisit that particular setup. Still, I was kind of surprised by how incredibly boring all the talents looked, as I seem to remember quite liking the condensed talent trees during original Cataclysm.</p><p>Finally I was ready to pick up the breadcrumb quest to Northrend. It sent me to Borean Tundra when I would\'ve preferred Howling Fjord, but in that moment I genuinely couldn\'t even remember where to board the right boat for that. So I just hopped onto the next ferry leaving Stormwind to start in the Tundra.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuxQkdBB6Ol-MloFZyRkmlLv-EjfrOREgdcGO3Dp3zcOeKzyGQtgCL8LfqpJtj4x8dTecE6Nj-Y1IYrsmLsPhFq0EIOKBAwEoNSorZzeM5tResF9OKE8FJnj0-CQGfGRg-wAhHm5UiiAjupyVGFIDxmv6lQ2Yg7NxGN5dMACP7-9J18_JqVPjmLy6H0FuS/s1920/Tiir%20riding%20the%20boat%20to%20Northrend.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female night elf hunter in mostly tier 5 gear on the boat to Northrend with her lynx pet" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuxQkdBB6Ol-MloFZyRkmlLv-EjfrOREgdcGO3Dp3zcOeKzyGQtgCL8LfqpJtj4x8dTecE6Nj-Y1IYrsmLsPhFq0EIOKBAwEoNSorZzeM5tResF9OKE8FJnj0-CQGfGRg-wAhHm5UiiAjupyVGFIDxmv6lQ2Yg7NxGN5dMACP7-9J18_JqVPjmLy6H0FuS/w400-h225/Tiir%20riding%20the%20boat%20to%20Northrend.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>I miss boats being relevant. They are slow but they really force you to immerse yourself in the world for a few minutes in a way that portals don\'t.</p><p>I decided I could be picky with which quests to do, so I only did about a third of the zone (if that) and also made a trip to Dalaran and Howling Fjord to pick up some flight paths. Unsurprisingly I suppose, this was enough to net me two levels in that single play session. The Wrath portion of the levelling curve was presumably nerfed again with the release of Cata, <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24204830/cataclysm-classic-the-joyous-journeys-50-experience-buff-is-back">there\'s another bonus XP event going on right now</a>, and I was fully rested. Still, considering I\'m not here for Northrend or the Shattering, I found the levelling speed heartening and it made the prospect of making it through the last two expansions I\'d skipped less daunting. I expect that 80-85 might still be a bit of a pain unless they nerf it with the pre-patch or something, but we\'ll see. I\'ll probably do Vashj\'ir since I haven\'t done that zone in ages... but first I need to actually make my way through Northrend.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/06/checking-in-on-cataclysm-classic.html'}], 'link': 'https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2025/06/checking-in-on-cataclysm-classic.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPbgYitVSJg-Kea3RMZi8GnlO8L92iK0T-90bYq_lzkxDT82-Gj6095PicE0_cQVPg1d9_dBBMnun_RjYBYSsfQMt4s7ee9VIoW3Wn3Xzp07lokDHTUzXQxM1iGCBqmB64RGDa8ttEU6IDbY8Gtr79TG_pUY3d04xDA6O34dQM-8QG3V1Z9e1IjsvxfxaJ/s72-w400-h225-c/Busy%20evening%20in%20Stormwind.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '3'}

The game appears (and plays) like an aquatic combination of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/18/coffee-talk-review/">Coffee Talk</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/15/steamworld-dig-2-review/">SteamWorld Dig</a></em>, which are both games I very much enjoy. I downloaded <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> upon release on Switch, but it fell into my backlog until this year; in recent months, I&#8217;ve gotten around to properly playing through the game, and I&#8217;m glad I did so &#8211; not only does it deliver on the rewarding gameplay loop and sumptuous pixel art graphics I hoped for, but it&#8217;s been an ideal showcase for chilled handheld gaming on the Nintendo Switch 2!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting the review, I&#8217;d like to mention the brief controversy around <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, as I remember it adding unfair caution to my approach to the game. Back in 2023, the game was nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards, which drew criticism because the game wasn&#8217;t an Indie game &#8211; the developer MINTROCKET was a subsidiary of Nexon, a lucrative South Korean company. The developers were not responsible for the game being nominated, and it appears that the nomination was based off of the pixel art graphics and relaxed alternative vibe of the game, instead of the literal definition of an independent company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, the CEO of MINTROCKET &#8211; and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> creator &#8211; Jaeho Hwang said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>“I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like a more detailed explanation and opinion, I highly recommend <a href="https://indiecator.org/2023/11/15/why-is-dave-the-diver-not-indie/">this post on <em>Indiecator</em> by MagiWasTaken</a>, which discusses the situation in better detail than I could in this short review introduction. Ironically, it&#8217;s since been announced in 2024 that MINTROCKET is becoming independent (albeit with support from Nexon to carry out the move). My main point is that this controversy is not something to think ill of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> or MINTROCKET for, and that allowed me to dive into the game fresh. Right, that&#8217;s enough preamble, so let&#8217;s get into the review!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Catch of the Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> follows the story of Dave and his friends, who&#8217;ve travelled to the oceanic Blue Hole to set up a sushi restaurant called Bancho Sushi (named after the head chef Bancho). As the title suggests, Dave must dive underwater to collect the fish and ingredients, and this forms the majority of the game &#8211; you must balance risk and reward as you collect as much as Dave can carry, whilst keeping track of your oxygen levels and means to get back to the surface &#8211; either by swimming back up, or finding an Escape Pod point. If you run out of oxygen and get stranded underwater, you lose all but one of your collected items, which severely impacts the success of the sushi restaurant in the evenings. This risk/reward system is reminiscent of the digging in <em>SteamWorld Dig</em>, and is implemented superbly here &#8211; the player has to make the tough decision between keeping what they&#8217;ve got, or risking pushing a little further and potentially losing it all. It&#8217;s a brilliant gameplay loop that keeps you coming back for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15160" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15140" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15139" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The game eases you in gently, starting with introducing the mechanics of catching fish at a relatively shallow depth. Your main weapon is the harpoon, which can be fired in front of you to reel in fish. However, there&#8217;s a delay whilst the fish struggles, which gives other dangerous creatures the time to close in on Dave &#8211; and later on, the harpoon requires multiple hits and/or extra button combinations to capture stronger fish. There are also various items to discover and collect, either as supplementary ingredients found in submerged cooking pots, or as materials scattered on the sea floor. Dave only has a certain amount they can hold at once, which quickly becomes reason to earn the Gold needed for upgrading your Cargo Box storage limit &#8211; as well as your Air Tank, Harpoon Gun, and more. In turn, this motivates the player for the sushi segments of the game; depending on how well the restaurant performs in the evenings, the more Gold you&#8217;ll earn for upgrades. Both sides of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> continue to ingeniously compliment each other in this way, as success in one helps you in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the sushi segments are rather different from the diving, and this is where my earlier comparison to <em>Coffee Talk</em> comes in. After setting sail to Bancho Sushi, you start by going through a list of your possible dishes to serve in your evening menu; your selection is based upon the fish you&#8217;ve caught and the ingredients you&#8217;ve acquired. The quality and quantity of your haul determines your success, as rarer fish open up more expensive dishes that result in a more lucrative evening. Upon selecting each dish, you can also enhance it if you have enough excess ingredients &#8211; a process given extra visual flair by the wonderful animated cutscenes of Bancho preparing the food. These animations aren&#8217;t limited to just Bancho, and are sprinkled throughout <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, such as when weapons expert Duff upgrades your guns. Each of these sequences has a tongue-in-cheek over-exaggerated tone, and add to the playful charm of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15133" height="360" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif?w=640" width="640" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in Bancho Sushi you can browse and sell your ingredients for quickfire Gold, as well as decorate the restaurant as you see fit, and even hire extra members of staff to help you out. The latter are essential, as over time the restaurant gets busier; once you open the restaurant, you control Dave as he serves dishes and maintains the restaurant, and hiring extra hands to help is key to success. Whether it&#8217;s pouring drinks, dashing around to serve sushi plates, cleaning up, or keeping Bancho well-stocked with sushi, this is a frenetic <em>Overcooked</em>-style part of the game that contrasts well with the diving. It&#8217;s certainly not as layered as the underwater gameplay, but it&#8217;s not supposed to be, and does a successful job at giving the player a break between each dive. Plus, it&#8217;s extremely satisfying to see the profits come in &#8211; which can then be spent on upgrades the next day, when the cycle begins anew&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Just Keep Swimming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this core gameplay loop, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> steadily introduces new characters and locations throughout the seven main story chapters. They&#8217;re an eclectic bunch, each with their own expertise and side quests. Archaeologist Dr. Bacon propels the main story forward; as you dive deeper, you discover much more than just fish, including secret civilizations and bigger ecological threats to the Blue Hole &#8211; the latter of which is tracked by the biologist Ellie, who gives you various collection tasks through the Ecowatcher app. Speaking of which, your progress is mostly tracked via these apps, which are accessed via the efficient menu on Dave&#8217;s smartphone. To give a few examples: you might use the phone to acquire and upgrade weapons (with the help of the aforementioned Duff); you might browse your snaps for photographer Udo; or you might look through your Pokémon-style Marinca collection for Sato, an Ash Ketchum lookalike!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15146" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15153" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15154" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between all these characters and side quests, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> has something for everyone. If you like collecting then you can focus on filling out the Marinca (essentially a Pokédex for fish), if you like the sushi-management side you can focus on optimising your earnings, and if you like exploring then you can focus on the diving. Whichever way you play, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> smartly manages to naturally push the story on regardless &#8211; for example, a character named Otto opens a farm partway into the game, where you can grow crops such as rice. Growing these ingredients helps you to reliably create more valuable dishes in the evening; but to help out Otto and subsequently build up the farm, you need to collect certain items, which requires becoming proficient at the diving. Each element of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> gently motivates the others in this way, and therefore pushes the player to test out every facet of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a side effect of this admirable gameplay variety is that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> occasionally inserts under-baked minigames or quick time events. One instance of this is the cooking competition side missions, where you must gather ingredients for Bancho as you normally would, but upon doing so, you must then engage in first-person cooking challenges. These consist of basic button presses and directional inputs, and feel like a rushed version of either a <em>Cooking Mama</em> or <em>Mario Party</em> minigame. It was the rare moment in <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> where I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15123" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15124" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15127" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15136" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, some of these asides work better than others &#8211; a relatively quick soldering minigame is an enjoyable and brief inclusion, and there&#8217;s a compelling <em>Balatro</em>-style card game, but on the other hand, a one-time stealth sequence is particularly badly designed. These hiccups are rare enough that they don&#8217;t significantly detract from <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, but they were also noticeable enough that I had to mention them in this review. They just feel unnecessary &#8211; it&#8217;s as if <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> felt it had to extend itself beyond the main gameplay loop that it executes so superbly. If anything, the high quality of the core diving-and-sushi-selling gameplay only make the brief diversions more jarring.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Deadly Depths</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the various other side missions and gameplay mechanics, it&#8217;s the diving that&#8217;s understandably the focus of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, and it&#8217;s exceptionally well-balanced. As aforementioned, your initial harpoon is a unique weapon to master &#8211; but Dave can also carry one firearm, either by collecting them underwater or by crafting them beforehand. There&#8217;s a range of weapon types: you might use the Net Gun for catching large swathes of fish, or perhaps the Grenade Launcher for explosive damage, or even (my weapon of choice) the Sniper Rifle for long-range damage. The latter is especially handy when tackling sea life that is aggressive at close range, such as the many sharks patrolling the Blue Hole!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15161" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Dave isn&#8217;t just reeling in small fish. You&#8217;ll soon be fighting not only sharks, but hostile jellyfish, giant squids, and plenty more! Significant story events are often accompanied by a boss fight against a dangerous opponent such as these, introduced with stylish freeze frames reminiscent of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and signifying the stakes of the encounter. Additionally, new areas of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> can be a trial by fire, with enemies that suddenly reduce huge amounts of your oxygen supply (which doubles as a health bar of sorts) with a single hit. However, the challenge rarely felt unfair, and any failed dives were always down to my own mistakes &#8211; and only left me more motivated to improve my aquatic skills or upgrade my gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, as well as your harpoon and firearm, Dave can carry a melee weapon (also used for mining materials) and two pieces of equipment. The latter of these can vary, from battle items such as a proximity mine, to ways of helping Dave in a pinch, such as portable oxygen refills. Most of these can be found underwater, or alternatively, they can be pre-purchased from Cobra in the boat before starting your dive, adding another way for the player to customise their approach. Overall, there&#8217;s a well-judged balance between giving the player plenty of options, but not giving you so much power that you can become complacent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15142" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15172" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15168" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when you feel comfortable with Dave and his toolset, the missions being asked of you often cleverly push you out of your comfort zone &#8211; and if you&#8217;re not careful, it doesn&#8217;t take much for a dangerous enemy or perilous area to derail your dive and leave you back at the boat almost empty-handed. It&#8217;s oh-so-easy to fall into the trap of completing just one more mission, collecting just one more item, capturing just one more fish &#8211; but equally, there&#8217;s an undeniable thrill to escaping just in time. In the later chapters, missions become more specific to match your increased skills, and particular ingredients can necessitate repeated captures of rare creatures. This cycle reminded me of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and similarly to that series, provides a tangible reason to keep capturing the most elusive fish &#8211; in this case, to find the rarest ingredients and compose the finest dishes at Bancho Sushi!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Under the Sea</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the endearing yet adventurous nature of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the graphical style; the gorgeous pixel-art invites you in, making diving a little deeper &#8211; and playing a little longer &#8211; even more enticing. The shallow regions are full of bright welcoming colours, but the variety only builds from here. Every layer under the water has a unique visual identity, such as the dark Blue Hole Depths, or the extreme cold and heat of later areas. Meanwhile, night-time dives feature a shining kaleidoscope of colourful foliage that feels magical to navigate &#8211; when you&#8217;re not being pursued by deadly fish, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15162" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the human character designs have a palpable sense of personality. This gets more spotlight in the earlier-mentioned animated cutscenes, which blend the stunning pixel art with the tongue-in-cheek humour that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> does so well. By the end of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, the roster of characters have a real sense of camaraderie between them, which contributes to that overall warm and relaxed feeling that the game has. Add in the detailed multitude of marine species and food recipes, and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> really is a delectably beautiful game. Playing it on the large handheld screen <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/09/09/did-my-hopes-for-the-switch-2-become-a-reality/">of the Switch 2</a> has only accentuated this feeling further for me &#8211; and it&#8217;s been a great example for how that console helps the back catalogue of the original Switch to shine even brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial compliment to the visuals of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the music, which is often a wonderfully soothing backdrop to your deep sea exploration. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a notably therapeutic game when you’re just casually collecting fish, exploring the vast swathes of water, and listening to the delicate musical backdrop. My favourite piece of music is for a late-game frozen area, where these tranquil tones morph into a synth-style inspirational beat. Also, music fans will get an extra treat from a certain cameo appearance at Bancho Sushi, who comes complete with a musical performance that I’ve been listening to many times since! Not to be glossed over is the sound design, too &#8211; the sounds of marine life, the tense pull of a harpoon, the whooshing of waves, it all sounds authentic and distinct, and pulls you further into the watery world of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15163" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15148" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg?w=863" width="863" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15150" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing about this game &#8211; it reels you in, not necessarily in a sudden way, but a gradual one. As the in-game days go by, you settle more thoroughly into the gameplay loop, getting more familiar with characters old and new, until they become familiar friends on your adventure. There&#8217;s a sense of pleasing routine to checking your farms for crops and ingredients, then going diving and completing missions, before then preparing for the evening Bancho Sushi business. It&#8217;s a lot like the charm of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> or <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but with the added element of gripping underwater gameplay to go alongside it. The game is kept fresh by the steady incline of options and equipment available to Dave, and this creates an endgame with potentially endless longevity. Even when you finish all of the main story missions, you still have a restaurant business to run, and you can continue building it out to your hearts content. There&#8217;s extra DLC too, two of which (the <em>Dredge</em> and <em>Godzilla</em> tie-in packs) are free, for those looking for extra content!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a delight to play through <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. The mix of gripping gameplay and relaxing sushi simulation &#8211; combined with the incredible art direction and music &#8211; makes for an RPG full of endearing charm and well-meaning adventure. At its heart is whimsy and a sense of positivity, and that soaks through into every part of the game &#8211; and each part compliments the other in a wonderfully natural way. My only criticism is that this enthusiasm leads to the introduction of impromptu minigames and quick time events that sometimes feel underdeveloped in contrast to the main diving gameplay &#8211; but they&#8217;re few and far between, and a drop in the ocean compared to the sea of brilliance within <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. There&#8217;s brilliant longevity built in too &#8211; even after finishing the main story, the diving and sushi restaurant aspects remain, for those who&#8217;d like to continue building Bancho Sushi into the best restaurant it can be. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a treasure of a game, and it comes highly recommended from me!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center

This particular Direct was split into three distinct segments: first about the 40th Anniversary of Mario, then news for the original Nintendo Switch, and then finally information on the Switch 2 &#8211; and altogether it made for a barnstorming hour-long performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo has been on a run of brilliant Directs over the last few years, but this might genuinely be my favourite one for a long while. Many of the announcements in this Direct speak specifically to me and the games I have been looking forward to, and it&#8217;s genuinely made whittling my choices down to five a tough task! If you&#8217;d like to see the full Nintendo Direct, you can do so below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Honourable Mentions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of it being a tough task&#8230; With so much packed into the Direct, I am first going to run through some other announcements that I was glad or intrigued to see, but didn&#8217;t make the cut for the five announcements that appealed most to me personally. The Nintendo Direct started with several <em>Mario </em>announcements in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary: this included a trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> in 2026, as well as a collection of both <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> games for Nintendo Switch, coming October 2nd this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retrospectively, this does make <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/04/lets-chat-3d-mario-games-are-coming-to-switch-but-where-is-galaxy-2/">the decision not to include <em>Galaxy 2</em> in the <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> collection</a> feel very calculated. I personally will likely pass on this new release of the <em>Galaxy </em>games, as the £58.99 cost (or £33.99 separately) feels excessive &#8211; and whilst they are superb games, I doubt I&#8217;ll play them enough when there are so many other new games to play. I do, however, hope to get the physical <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOor7cl-qF_B_yaH1ketH1_ep2UqAIeMsULytGxbXaJ-8c79YpmKe">Rosalina&#8217;s Storybook</a> they are making, as that would be lovely to keep in the collection!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15028" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15029" height="377" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg?w=670" width="670" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15027" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15026" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we got a release date of 4th December for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was great to have confirmed &#8211; and the only reason it isn&#8217;t in my main five picks below is that the new footage left me a bit hesitant. We got to see the new bike Samus will use to traverse the world, and there was something off about it &#8211; the world looked a bit too empty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The footage reminded me of the infamous Mako in the first <em>Mass Effect</em> game, which was also known for wide open spaces that felt empty and were awkward to navigate. Visually, the bike is very cool, and the first-person segments look fantastic, but I was surprised at the briefness of this new footage. I sincerely hope that isn&#8217;t a sign of a lack of confidence in the game; either way, eight years after the initial announcement, I remain very excited for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> to finally launch!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I&#8217;d like to give a mention to the <em>Pokémon</em> segment of the Direct. We got the announcement of a brand new spin-off game named <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, which looks like a mix between<em> Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>, where you play as a Ditto-turned-human (whether this is charming or horrific, you decide)! This game probably won&#8217;t be for me, but I envisage it being very popular, by blending life-sim mechanics with the popularity of the world of <em>Pokémon</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, we got more info for the soon-to-be-released <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, showing off new Mega Evolutions; this segment ended with an announcement of the upcoming <em>Mega Dimension</em> paid DLC, and this felt quite cynical &#8211; it feels strange to have paid DLC announced before we even have the base game. I&#8217;ll wait and see how that DLC materialises, but for now, I&#8217;m fine not seeing much more about <em>Z-A</em>, as I&#8217;m definitely purchasing the game at launch. From here, the Direct transitioned into the surprise announcement of <em>Danganronpa 2&#215;2</em>, a new version of <em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> with added content! I only relatively recently finished (<a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/09/danganronpa-2-goodbye-despair-review-an-ambitious-beautiful-mess-of-a-sequel/">and reviewed</a>) the original game on Switch, and I really enjoyed it overall, so I&#8217;ll be curious to see how much difference the additions make.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15020" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15024" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15025" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15022" height="338" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg?w=600" width="600" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That was quite a long honourable mentions section, wasn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a result of just how many exciting announcements we received; I finished this Direct feeling very optimistic about the future of the Switch 2, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten into my top five reason why! When there are so many announcements, writing this sort of article helps me process the Direct and focus in on the games I&#8217;m going to prioritise playing, and I hope it is an enjoyable read for you too! Right, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#5: Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the most exciting part of the <em>Mario </em>section of the Direct was the announcement of a brand new Yoshi game, named <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em>! Yoshi side-scrollers have a reputation for charming art directions &#8211; for example <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Woolly World</em> and <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Crafted World</em> &#8211; and this game continues that, with a gorgeous stop-motion visual style bursting with colour and personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot of the game follows Yoshi after the appearance of a peculiar book named Mr. E, with pages detailing mysterious creatures. Yoshi jumps into the book (which is the reason for the storybook graphical style) and meets various new creatures, with the details jotted down into the book as Yoshi does so. Completing the storybook of fantastical creatures is an accompaniment to the charming platforming, and there&#8217;s a palpable sense of warmth and whimsy to it all. This game looks ideal for playing on a rainy weekend, wrapped up warm and enjoying the cosy gameplay. I see <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>being a brilliant experience for all ages of players, and I look forward to playing it myself when it releases in Spring 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#4: Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Direct contained the announcements of release dates for several high-profile previously-announced games, and three of these appear on my list. Starting this off is <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>, the third <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> game after the original and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/05/15/my-to-play-list-may-2023-progress/">Age of Calamity</a></em>, which is confirmed to release on November 6th. Just as the latter of those filled in story gaps for <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, one of the main appeals of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is adding story details for <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. Specifically, the time period that Princess Zelda is sent back to in that game &#8211; and I&#8217;m glad to see this time covered more thoroughly, as it felt to me that Zelda was unfairly side-lined in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as a release date, the new footage showed off playable characters such as Queen Sonia, King Rauru, and a new unnamed Korok character. The gameplay looks like the expected <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-esque combat, but there are some additions, such as Zonai devices and multi-character Sync Strikes that change depending on the character combinations. There&#8217;s also the confirmation of local GameShare multiplayer and splitscreen, and glimpses of many epic visual sequences such as airborne Gleeok battles. I accept that the gameplay will likely be repetitive, but for me the appeal of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games is the visual spectacle and extra lore &#8211; and<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> looks to be delivering on that!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#3: Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the brand new announcements of the Direct was that of a new mainline <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, named <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em>. It&#8217;s been wonderful to see <em>Fire Emblem</em> gradually become a household name in the West, with the 3DS games such as <em>Awakening</em> laying the groundwork for <em>Three Houses</em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/14/a-little-zelda-a-lotta-farming-takeaways-from-the-nintendo-direct/">Engage</a> </em>to be massive hits on Switch. The distinction setting <em>Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart is the gladiator-style Heroic Games, which has a multitude of characters competing for the fulfilled wishes that supposedly reward your victory. At the end of the trailer, we see a tease of Sothis, a character from Three Houses &#8211; so it appears there may be a story connection to that game as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the game looks stunning, with gorgeous anime visuals, and clean turn-based strategy UI design. Part of the appeal of <em>Fire Emblem</em> is the stakes of building character relationships in a world where permadeath is possible, and the gladiatorial setting will hopefully provide a fresh twist to that structure that will set<em> Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart. The trailer has a variety of striking characters, and I&#8217;m looking forward to finding my favourites! For now, we only have a general 2026 release date, so I&#8217;d guess that this game will be one of the major late-year releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#2: Resident Evil: Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think it surprising that I&#8217;ve put two already-announced games above the news of a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game; but that&#8217;s a reflection of my adoration for the franchises these next two games are a part of, and how stoked I am to see additional news about their next instalments. Firstly we have <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, the much-anticipated ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> game (if you don&#8217;t count <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/27/resident-evil-zero-review/"><em>Resident Evil Zero</em></a>). This latest entry stars FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she pursues the truth about a deadly virus and the mystery of her mother&#8217;s death &#8211; a path which leads her to the ruins of Raccoon City. This game had already been announced for other consoles, but this is the formal announcement of a Switch 2 version, which is brilliant to see. On Switch, <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/11/25/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/16/resident-evil-village-review/">Resident Evil Village</a></em> could only be played as Cloud games, but the more conventional release of <em>Requiem </em>shows that the console can (for now, at least) keep up with modern large-scale third-party releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually might play <em>Requiem </em>on Switch 2 &#8211; my only other means would be PC or Xbox Series S, and as someone who likes to collect physical copies of <em>Resident Evil</em> games on console, that makes the Switch 2 version more appealing to me. <em>Requiem </em>is up there as one of my most anticipated games; I adore the <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise, and am eagerly awaiting <em>Requiem</em> to see how they interweave the lore of the series into the story. Other than Chris Redfield, we haven&#8217;t had any of the earlier characters show up in the main series since <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, and with the return to Raccoon City, this feels like an ideal time for some guest appearances of older, more experienced versions of those fan favourites. Grace Ashcroft is also the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character from the lesser-known spin-off <em>Resident Evil Outbreak</em> games, which already shows that Capcom is happy playing with some deep-cut lore. I happen to have bought the two <em>Outbreak</em> games second-hand before <em>Requiem</em> was even announced, and am planning to play them before the launch of <em>Requiem </em>and write up my thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Requiem </em>trailer in the Direct was full of intense visuals, threatening figures, and story hints (such as the iconic Umbrella Corporation logo). It struck me that there&#8217;s an underlying grungy tone waiting to break out, which I&#8217;m very excited to discover. This can even be seen in the logo for <em>Requiem</em>, and the burned-out profile shot of Grace near the end of this new trailer. Right now, the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise is in a very healthy place (as healthy a a series about viral monstrosities can be, anyway), and it&#8217;s given Capcom a resulting confidence that could make this game utterly exceptional. They&#8217;re playing their cards close to their chest, concealing the full extent of the horrors that await us on February 27th&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#1: Hades II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yes, oh yes. This is an announcement fans of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/14/hades-review/">Hades</a></em> and Supergiant Games have been awaiting since the reveal of <em>Hades II</em> back at The Game Awards in 2022, and now it&#8217;s here &#8211; the release date of the official 1.0 version, releasing digitally on Switch and PC on September 25th (and physically on November 20th). The first <em>Hades</em> is a phenomenal roguelike action game that turned many players into fans of the genre, but it was quite a surprise when Supergiant announced a sequel &#8211; not only was the first game utterly jam-packed with content and ideas, but they&#8217;d never done a sequel game before. I&#8217;ve purposefully been avoiding details about the game in Early Access, as I&#8217;d like to go in fresh and see what marvels Supergiant have cooked up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon this could be a <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>/<em>Galaxy 2</em> situation, where the developers have so many ideas and so much creativity to share, that they need a whole other game to fit it all in. This time, we play as the immortal Princess of the Underworld, battling against the Titan of Time and exploring an even larger and deeper mythic world of Olympian Gods. In the Direct, this was visualized with a cutscene that gave me goosebumps from the visual flair on show; Supergiant are known for their sumptuous visuals and music, and that&#8217;s very much still the case here. I&#8217;m eager to dive back into the rich gameplay and gripping story of the world of <em>Hades</em>, reuniting with previous characters (Artemis is back!) and meeting new ones. I honestly didn&#8217;t expect the release date to be so soon, but in less than two weeks we&#8217;ll be able to play the 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> &#8211; discovering new Boons, enemies, locations, and more. Bring it on!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>This Nintendo Direct was sensational, and answered many questions about release dates and upcoming games for the Switch 2 (and Switch) release slate. I&#8217;ve been enjoying my gaming a lot recently, and this Direct has only fuelled that passion more &#8211; the only problem is going to be finding the time to play all these games!

It&#8217;s been roughly a year and a half since I wrote that post, and the Switch 2 has been out for just over three months &#8211; so we now have comprehensive knowledge of what the system offers. With the Switch 2, Nintendo took the wise (and safe) approach, capitalising on the continued popularity of the Switch brand and not changing things too drastically. The console is more of an iteration rather than a revolution, but it certainly makes significant changes and upgrades in certain areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had some time with the Switch 2, I thought it&#8217;d be a suitable moment to take a look back at my aforementioned post about my hopes for the console, run one-by-one through the list, and talk about which became a reality (and which didn&#8217;t). Then, at the end of the post, I&#8217;ll summarise my current personal opinions on the Switch 2, taking these results into account. Right then, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Optimize the eShop: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My foremost request was to improve the eShop, which was struggling on multiple fronts on the original Switch: the sheer volume of releases made discoverability of games difficult; there was a lack of quality control; and the user interface was susceptible to noticeable lag. In my opinion, this was one of the most important areas for Nintendo to improve upon &#8211; it might seem less flashy than other aspects, but improving the process of finding new digital games is an underrated key aspect of a modern console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To start on a positive note, I&#8217;m pleased with the way Nintendo has improved the responsiveness of the eShop. I immediately noticed how much quicker and easier it is to navigate the store &#8211; gone are the painful moments waiting for the eShop to catch up with your inputs. Whether this is down to the increased hardware power, general eShop optimisation, or both, it improves the experience of browsing through the available games, and encourages curiosity as a result. In my book, that boost to game discoverability is a win for both the player and the developers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, whilst Nintendo has bolstered the options on the eShop main menu, it&#8217;s not as extensively as I&#8217;d hoped. Most of the options &#8211; such as the Search, Current Offers, and Coming Soon &#8211; are the same, and the only brand new addition is the For You tab, which recommends games based on your own gameplay trends. I was really hoping for some other additions, or even a review system so that players could help to recommend games for others. As it is, the eShop still has the problem of a constant inundation of new games &#8211; and whilst the Popular New Releases sub-section is a step in the right direction, any game that doesn&#8217;t qualify for this (or the Highlights tab) will get very limited time to grab player attention before the spotlight is taken by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14942" height="645" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14940" height="639" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14938" height="624" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14941" height="598" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of quality control, I reserve full judgement until more time has passed, but it seems that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t changed their approach. Lots of cheap-looking games are still flooding the eShop, and there are still Hentai games appearing relatively frequently. From my perspective, Nintendo could still do with raising the bar of entry, in order to curate a higher level of overall quality across the eShop. The current influx of these low-quality games worsens the issue of discoverability for other titles, which get mired amidst them despite taking much more time and effort to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the steps I&#8217;d still like to see taken for more eShop filtering options and better quality control, Nintendo has still significantly improved the eShop, especially in terms of responsiveness. Therefore, I mark this section as a success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More Power: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is that age-old request for new consoles &#8211; that they have more power, and are able to present games in higher framerates and resolutions. Since the Wii/DS era, Nintendo has rarely (if ever) been known as the technical powerhouse, with art direction, creative hardware, and recognizable IP being more important for bringing in players. That said, the Switch 2 is a big step up from the original Switch, with Nvidia claiming that it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nvidia-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">&#8220;10 times the graphical performance&#8221;</a> of the previous console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a technical expert, so I look for comparisons to other consoles to get a handle on where the Switch 2 lands power-wise. The general perception seems to be that at peak performance, docked on a TV, the Switch 2 is comparable to a PlayStation 4 Pro, but still behind the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles &#8211; which essentially matches my prediction back in March 2024. When played in handheld mode, the system is closer to a base PlayStation 4, but that is compensated for by the smaller screen, which often makes games look crisper to the eye (at least for me).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a hybrid system with a handheld option, battery life is another crucial factor to consider, and the increased performance does appear to have hurt the Switch 2 in this area. You generally get around two-three hours when playing any sort of intensive game, which can feel quite short. However, most of the time I don&#8217;t see this being an issue, unless I am on a very long journey &#8211; and it&#8217;s rare not to have a nearby place to plug in and charge. Whilst that isn&#8217;t an excuse, I prefer Nintendo providing stronger hardware and a shorter battery life rather than the opposite, so I&#8217;m still satisfied on this front. For example, I&#8217;m playing <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/09/17/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-14-09-23/">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em> at the moment, and occasionally having to charge the console is a small price to pay for how well it plays and looks in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14949" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14946" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14947" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14948" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When playing in handheld mode, the screen really is stunning; the increased size and power makes games look incredible, and it makes playing in bed (or wherever you prefer) feel like a luxury. The vibrancy and sharpness of the screen &#8211; especially when held close up for handheld gaming &#8211; gave me that new-generation-upgrade feeling that I was looking for. I&#8217;ve heard some disappointment that Nintendo didn&#8217;t use an OLED screen, but in my opinion the LCD screen is more than sufficient, and if it helps keep costs down then that&#8217;s a reasonable trade. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll get an OLED version of the Switch 2 (like for the original Switch) at some point too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only Switch 2-exclusive game I&#8217;ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em> (you can <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/10/mario-kart-world-review-a-stunning-racer-that-misses-a-few-tricks/">read my review here</a>), and as well as being a fantastic game, it doubles as an excellent technical showcase for the Switch 2. Played in 4K HDR on my TV, it looks sensational. The game moves with a crisp fluidity, and the environment feels palpably full of detail and colour. It was upon playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> that it really dawned on me that the Switch 2 was a major &#8211; and timely &#8211; graphical update on its predecessor, allowing it to keep fair pace with the technical state of gaming.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14934" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>All that graphical performance is needed to do justice to the beauty of Cow</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>All in all, whilst my test case for the Switch 2 is relatively limited for now (I haven&#8217;t played upgraded Switch games like <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em> yet either), I&#8217;m confident that the Switch 2 has delivered on the level of power I personally need in a Nintendo console. I don&#8217;t need it to be top-of-the-range; as long as the system is powerful enough to realise the trademark visual flair of first-party Nintendo games, and is able to house a strong line-up of new third-party releases, then that&#8217;s plenty for me. I eagerly await seeing what Nintendo can magic up with their bespoke Switch 2 games in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Clarity on Games: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads nicely into my next point, on the topic of the Switch 2 software line-up now and into the future. A console is defined by the games on it &#8211; and there were two particular games I was waiting for news on when I wrote that original post in March 2024. These were <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> and also the next Nintendo EAD game, which I predicted would be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game in the vein of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. We have received news on both of these games, even if the latter wasn&#8217;t quite the game I expected, as it has instead materialised as <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14932" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I am loving the vibrant purples in this art, by the way</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about <em>Metroid</em>. The development path of the long-awaited <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> has been turbulent, to say the least &#8211; after being announced back in 2017, Nintendo then publicly announced that they were restarting development in 2019, with Retro Studios (the developers of the original <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em>) coming back on board. When I wrote my post about my hopes for the Switch 2, we were still awaiting news on Metroid &#8211; but roughly three months later <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/06/19/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-18-06-2024/">in the June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, Nintendo finally showed us an announcement trailer for the newly-titled <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That initial trailer gave us a taste of the returning first-person <em>Metroid</em> gameplay and a glimpse of returning enemy Sylux, which kept fans occupied until February 2025, when it was announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM&amp;t=1631s">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> that <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> would be a cross-generation title on both Switch and Switch 2. Whilst unsurprising, this was welcome news &#8211; and roughly a month later in March, we got another Nintendo Direct trailer (see below), showing off more of the game and giving us a 2025 release date. This was followed up by an extensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9xes7BZto">Nintendo Treehouse video</a> in April, continuing the steady stream of new information on the game. However, as we enter September, we&#8217;re awaiting news on a precise release date, and I hope we hear more soon. Even if the game has to be pushed into 2026, I wouldn&#8217;t mind &#8211; after so long waiting, I&#8217;d prefer to wait a little longer if it means a better experience. What&#8217;s another few months after eight years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be fascinating to see the comparison between the Switch 2 and Switch editions of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>; the enhanced Switch 2 edition will have Joy-Con 2 mouse controls as well as support for 4K, HDR, and 120 fps! After seeing how brilliant <em>Mario Kart World</em> looks, I&#8217;m excited to experience a new <em>Metroid</em> adventure in these formats &#8211; I have a feeling the game will look sensational. So far, it appears that the game isn&#8217;t straying too far from the gameplay of previous <em>Prime </em>games, and instead refining the first-person formula, with some added tricks such as Psychic Abilities for Samus. I&#8217;m especially intrigued to see where the story goes, and am avoiding too many plot details until release!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, I thought <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was the more outlandish of the two games I was anticipating back in March 2024, as I was confident that a new 3D <em>Mario </em>from Nintendo EAD would be announced. I was both right and wrong &#8211; whilst we haven&#8217;t received a 3D <em>Mario </em>per se, we have gotten a new <em>Mario</em>-adjacent Nintendo EAD 3D game, in the form of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! This was the closing reveal in the Switch 2 Direct back in April; but it wasn&#8217;t until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Direct</a> in June that it was announced this isn&#8217;t just a Donkey Kong game, but a Pauline game as well, with a younger version of the character joining DK on his travels!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo EAD have an amazing track record, and the glowing critical reception to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>has been a continuation of this, praising the sheer gameplay creativity and enjoyment. One of the key features is the ability for Donkey Kong to smash through the environment, reshaping and even creating tunnels through it! The game released on 17th July, and I haven&#8217;t actually played it yet, as I haven&#8217;t found the time to justify spending the money on it. But now <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/">that I&#8217;ve finished the Pokémon League in <em>Pokémon Diamond</em></a> and am taking a break from that, I&#8217;ll hopefully soon get around to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, my next definite Switch 2 purchase will be <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, and I&#8217;m very tempted to get <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> too! There&#8217;s also the question about how series such as <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/10/25/where-can-zelda-go-after-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> might manifest on Switch 2, but I&#8217;m happy having patience &#8211; there are already so many other amazing games to play in the meantime!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More System Customization: No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, here we come to the first of my hopes that didn&#8217;t become a reality. The original Switch only allowed very simple customisation of the Home screen, and Switch 2 hasn&#8217;t evolved this at all, still only allowing two Themes: Basic White and Basic Black (my console is set to the latter). Having a Themes menu suggests the idea of having more options, but I&#8217;m not full of confidence, as we haven&#8217;t received any extra options since the original Switch launch in 2017.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14926" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I like neutral colours, but the option to add more flair could be fun</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not a software developer, it feels like Nintendo is missing an open goal by not allowing us to have Themes based on franchises such as <em>Mario</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, or <em>Metroid</em> &#8211; I honestly think people would even spend a small amount on these, in order to add vibrant new visuals to their systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that Nintendo could still add options in the future, but it&#8217;s disappointing that for now there&#8217;s no word on this. In my March 2024 post, I suggested extra options such as the <em>Nintendo Badge Arcade</em> sticker system on 3DS, but now I feel as if I need to keep expectations in check. At this point, even a couple extra Themes would be great to see.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14928" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Themes menu even seems designed to hold more options</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As on the original Switch, the main way of showing personality is through your profile icon. Nintendo has added extra customisation options over time, particularly via the Nintendo Switch Online menu, where you can unlock new characters, backgrounds, and frames for your profile icon. Whilst it&#8217;s a mostly unchanged process from the Switch, I&#8217;m glad this bit of customisation is still present. I imagine it won&#8217;t be too long until we get more Joy-Con 2 colours, so at least there should soon be that avenue for customising the look of your console (if you have the expendable income). Considering how popular the Switch 2 is, it&#8217;d be wonderful to see more done on the digital side to allow players to show their personality. I hope we see developments in this area in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Enhanced Social Features: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth and final entry on this list regards the social aspects of the Switch &#8211; in my original post, this was primarily about having improved voice chat functions, and thankfully, this is the main social aspect where the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade! After years (and multiple console generations) of players asking, Nintendo has finally added an in-built party voice chat to the Switch 2, named GameChat. It&#8217;s now possible to talk to your registered friends over the internet, using the in-built microphone in the Switch (and Camera, if purchased), even if they are playing different software. Whilst it isn&#8217;t revolutionary &#8211; after all, other consoles have had similar systems for a long time &#8211; it&#8217;s a welcome addition that I&#8217;m very happy to see Nintendo include for the Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous Nintendo consoles have had forms of voice chat, but they always had some sort of catch &#8211; for example on the Switch, where voice chat was tied to the Switch Online mobile app. So, it&#8217;s great to see Nintendo introduce a more complete and in-built offering &#8211; if anything, I feel a bit bad, because I doubt I&#8217;ll use it much. As the years have passed, I&#8217;ve gotten used to using Discord as an alternative form of online chat when playing Nintendo games, because it&#8217;s been more convenient &#8211; and I think it&#8217;ll be hard to break out of that routine. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m very glad GameChat has been added for the Switch 2, and I commend Nintendo for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I hoped to see some sort of extensive social hub added, along the lines of Miiverse or StreetPass. The closest is the Nintendo Switch App, which has new functionality such as uploading screenshots, receiving GameChat notifications, and (most intriguingly) interacting with games such as <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (see the images below). But I miss the in-built communal aspects of previous systems, as they brought people together without as much push towards a mobile app. We still have the News channels to get specific updates on the topics and games you choose to follow, but these are mostly one-way interactions. Nintendo has done well in previous generations at creating unique spaces for players to help shape the multiplayer culture of their consoles, but Switch and Switch 2 feel a bit more controlled in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14922" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14921" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14923" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another aspect that the Switch 2 still lacks is an equivalent to Achievements or Trophies. This is something I used to think was a glaring omission, as it would be a great extra motivation to 100% games such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/04/30/lets-chat-a-long-overdue-super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>. But <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/16/why-ive-stopped-caring-so-much-about-achievements-trophies/">as years have gone by</a>, I have gained respect for Nintendo not having this sort of system, whether it be by conscious decision or simply a lack of intention to do so. There&#8217;s something freeing about playing games on the Switch, and indeed, the Switch 2 &#8211; there&#8217;s a lack of TV/streaming apps, or completion-style Achievement/Trophy systems, and instead the focus is all on the act of playing games. That laser-focus is really refreshing, and I&#8217;m not clamouring for those additions at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, whilst I&#8217;d like to see an expansion into a more communal gaming hub in the future, the Switch 2 definitely delivered on my hope for enhanced social features. The addition of GameChat is one of the major upgrades for the Switch 2, and a lot of marketing and development focus went into it, which shows Nintendo listened to player requests for this type of addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After going through those five points, how has the Switch 2 fared when it comes to my personal hopes for the console? Four of my five points were met to some degree of success, which I mark as a win overall. Evidently, Nintendo recognised the general areas where improvements could be made &#8211; and whilst not all of them were as emphatic an upgrade as I may have hoped, the cumulative progress makes for a significant leap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarise, I&#8217;m going to rattle back through the main points. Firstly, the eShop is much easier and faster to navigate, but could still do with more options for filters and user reviews. In addition, the console is a step up in power, and whilst it isn&#8217;t at the level of modern Microsoft and Sony consoles, games look brilliant and the hardware keeps Nintendo in the ballpark for third-party games. Speaking of which, we have received welcome news on <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, and seen the release of a new exciting Nintendo EAD game in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, and now we wait for the likes of <em>Pokémon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and other franchises to launch on the console. Sadly, Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added much in the way of system customization, but it has delivered new social options in the form of GameChat, finally bringing in-built party chat to a Nintendo console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the admitted caveats to some of the &#8220;Yes&#8221; points, I want to focus on the positives of the Switch 2. This is because, despite the iterative nature of the console, it does achieve that new-console feel. I was worried that it might feel like another specification of Switch instead of a brand new thing, but there are enough upgrades to ensure that isn&#8217;t the case. Much of this is down to the optimized power of the console, and how much snappier and responsive it is to play. But another contributing factor is the hardware itself &#8211; in handheld mode, the larger form factor and sleeker Joy-Con 2 designs feels fresh and streamlined, and the console has made playing in bed (for example) feel like a delightful high-end experience. I will say, it helps that I have massive hands, so the larger console size is more comfortable for me personally.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14952" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d like to see Nintendo continue to make software improvements to the Switch 2 &#8211; for example new eShop features, new menu Themes, and extra social hubs &#8211; but I&#8217;m left with a firmly positive impression of the console overall. I&#8217;ve been getting back into playing games more frequently recently, and I&#8217;m glad to say that the Switch 2 has been a contributing factor to that; and if I&#8217;m playing more games and having a good time doing so, that marks the Switch 2 as a success in my book!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this post!

As mentioned in that post, I was part-way through my first ever play through of <em>Diamond </em>at the time of writing. Of the two initial games (<em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>), <em>Pearl </em>was the one I got back in 2007, before then playing the third game <em>Platinum </em>when it released in 2009. I’ve kept my <em>Pearl </em>save to this day, whilst <em>Platinum </em>became the game I’d restart whenever I went back to play through Sinnoh &#8211; especially as it has extra content and various quality-of-life refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I hadn’t ever played <em>Diamond </em>until I felt compelled to buy myself a copy for £48.49 from GAME back in 2019. After all, <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>are second only to <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/07/11/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> in terms of my favourite games ever, so it’s lovely to have the complete set of three physical games. I’ve been gradually playing through <em>Diamond </em>ever since; in that aforementioned 2023 post, I noted that I’d reached the trek to Snowpoint City, roughly two-thirds of the way through the game. Since then, I&#8217;ve played a little bit more each year, finishing the villainous Team Galactic part of the main story, catching the cover Legendary Pokemon Dialga, and now preparing to tackle the Pokémon League!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-12 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14830" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14828" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14829" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14806" height="715" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve played through the Sinnoh-based <em>Pokémon</em> games, and the adventure feels a little different every time, for multiple reasons: , it might be the <em>Pokémon</em> team I choose, the approach I take, or how I’m feeling in my personal life at the time. With this being my first time playing <em>Diamond</em>, it&#8217;s felt unique once again &#8211; and as I gradually get ready to reach the end of the game (and start the postgame), I thought it’d be a nice point at which to write a journal-style post about the playthrough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, this journal approach matches my new writing method I’ve been testing, where I write a little bit every day, even if it’s just a paragraph or two. It’s helped me start posting at a more regular cadence recently, which I’ve really enjoyed, and am hoping to continue! I hope you’ll come with me on my retro-inspired ramble about my current adventuring in Sinnoh, and my plan to defeat the Pokémon League with a team that might be described as unconventional&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Shine Bright Like A&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this playthrough of <em>Diamond</em>, I decided not to create my character as “William”. I often style my avatar as myself on my first playthrough of a <em>Pokémon</em> game; but as I&#8217;ve played through Sinnoh many times before, I instead went for the approach I use on repeated playthroughs. In these situations, I like to create a new character persona, in a way that challenges my team selection, mixes up the gameplay, and allows me to add my own imaginary lore. Over the years, this has often led to me constructing a monotype team (usually Steel, my favourite type), but this time I went for a dichotomy theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14797" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14795" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The character I created is called Lucie, and I think of her as treading the line between both fiery and subdued personalities. Her starter is Chimchar, which will evolve into Infernape, one of the infamously few Fire type Pokémon in the core region of Sinnoh in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em> (the Elite Four member Flint has just two Fire types in their Fire-type team)! Two of the team slots are filled by a pair of Gastrodons (named Gianna and Gillian), a Pokémon which has two forms in Sinnoh: the pink West Sea Gastrodon, and the blue East Sea Gastrodon. By having one of each, it plays into that duality theming; I think of the pink Gastrodon as part of the &#8220;bright&#8221;, flamboyant side of the team, whilst the blue Gastrodon represents the &#8220;nocturnal&#8221;, subtler side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining the West Sea Gastrodon side of the team, we have the blazing Infernape (named Symphony), as well as Raichu (Ryland) and their electrifying moves. These Pokémon both deliver fast, strong damage: for example, Close Combat and Flare Blitz for Infernape, and Thunderbolt for Raichu. On the East Sea Gastrodon side is Noctowl (Miles), which has helpful status moves such as the sleep-inducing Hypnosis, as well as Skuntank (Skylah), which has Toxic for poisoning opponents and whittling them down. As you can probably tell, I&#8217;ve always liked to daydream up my own head canon for the characters and adventure. It helps every playthrough to feel unique, as if I&#8217;m adding extra world-building along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-14 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14793" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14791" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14787" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14788" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14790" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14789" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the team described above certainly isn&#8217;t the strongest possible for <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>&#8211; and I&#8217;m aware I&#8217;m making my life more difficult when it comes to battling the toughest trainers, such as the upcoming Elite Four and Champion Cynthia. But some of these Pokémon (especially Gastrodon, Nowtowl, and Skuntank) are Pokémon I&#8217;ve barely played with before, so I get to experience the challenge of Sinnoh in a brand new way! Mixing up the team helps every playthrough to feel fresh, and strengthens my personal connection with the team &#8211; not just now, but also when I look back on them years later, such as in a longevity app like <em>Pokémon HOME</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">A Girl&#8217;s Best Friend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;ve just finished working through Victory Road, reached the entrance to the Pokémon League, and completed the final fight against your in-game rival (on a whim, I named them Mervin). Relative to other games in the series, I&#8217;d argue that Sinnoh has the best Pokémon League &#8211; the members all have distinct personalities, and present a well-balanced challenge. The difficulty isn&#8217;t unfair, but requires you to take the League seriously; I&#8217;m currently in the phase of backtracking, training up the levels of my Pokémon, and refining the movesets, items, and strategies I&#8217;m going to approach the League with. With the team I&#8217;ve selected, it requires being very deliberate with my choices &#8211; of course, the main advantage I have is that I&#8217;m particularly familiar with the challenge that lies ahead, and can plan accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-15 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14817" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14811" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14821" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14820" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14818" height="168" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216" width="216" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14799" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sinnoh Pokémon League starts with the Bug-type trainer Aaron, who should be the easiest to defeat &#8211; Bug-types have many type weaknesses, such as to Fire and Flying, which my Infernape and Noctowl can target respectively. Next up will be Bertha and her Ground-type team, which will be a tougher test &#8211; the plethora of Ground attacks will be dangerous for Infernape and Raichu, so my two Gastrodons will be relied upon to use their Water-type moves. Noctowl has a useful immunity to Ground, and Skuntank can help out with Toxic, so my team has a decent amount of options for this battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is Flint, who as mentioned earlier, is a Fire-type trainer that curiously has three non-Fire types on their team. The two that are there &#8211; Rapidash and Infernape &#8211; should again struggle against the two Gastrodons, and then the rest of my team should be able to wear down Steelix, Drifblim, and Lopunny without too much issue. Then we&#8217;ll come to Lucian, the final member of the Elite Four, who has a Psychic-type team &#8211; and this is where Skuntank will have their turn taking centre stage, as their Dark typing makes them immune to Psychic moves. With the use of Night Slash (which has an elevated critical hit rate, boosted further by the equipped Razor Claw), Skuntank should carve through a lot of the opponents, with the help of Infernape to tackle the Steel typing of Bronzong.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-16 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14808" height="542" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721" width="721" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14810" height="548" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727" width="727" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing this plan out, it makes me fairly confident at defeating the Elite Four without too much trouble. However, players of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>know that the toughest challenge lies with Champion Cynthia and her excellent team of strong and varied Pokémon (which even includes a Gastrodon of her own)! The biggest threat is her ace Pokémon &#8211; Garchomp &#8211; which can likely take out most of my team with one hit from an Earthquake. My best options are going to be my two Gastrodons, which have strong defensive stats, and can use Blizzard and Ice Beam to hit the double Ice weakness of Garchomp. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll rely on Noctowl and Hypnosis, to give myself some more time. It&#8217;s going to be a nervy battle, but there are routes to success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">In Reflection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage of the game, where I&#8217;m backtracking and gradually training up my Pokémon, showcases some of why I adore <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>so much. In theory, this part could be tiresome, gradually grinding through the experience points needed to make my team stronger &#8211; but instead, I find it tranquil. There&#8217;s something magical about the way music, visuals, and gameplay combine in these games specifically, and I enjoy taking my time; one of the main places I&#8217;m training is Victory Road, as I can access a variety of strong wild Pokémon there. Near the entrance is a useful Pokémon Center for healing your team, and I often pause to listen to the &#8220;Pokémon League&#8221; music that plays outside it. This particular track has both &#8220;Day&#8221; and &#8220;Night&#8221; versions, and the latter is especially beautiful (you can listen below). It&#8217;s a beautifully delicate composition, and captures the feeling of being near the end of an amazing adventure, but with so much still left to enjoy, and no need to rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to this music is just one example of the catharsis I feel when playing <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, which is something I talked about back in my 2023 post. This sentiment comes from a place of both subjectivity and objectivity, as my emotional connection to these games is incredibly strong. After my older sister passed away in 2007, I spent hundreds of hours exploring Sinnoh, and I&#8217;m forever grateful to the soothing effect they had &#8211; and still have &#8211; on me. There are many positive aspects I associate with this: the meticulous sprite artwork and colour palette; the endearing Pokémon and character designs; the region full of secrets to explore; the sprawling Underground; and that amazing soundtrack, just to name a handful of reasons why I love these games so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I prepare to enter the Pokémon League, I&#8217;ve also started thinking about the postgame, which in <em>Diamond </em>includes a whole separate island northeast of Sinnoh, named the Battle Zone (see the map below). It includes the Fight Area, Resort Area, and Survival Area, plus Stark Mountain. The Fight Area includes the Battle Tower in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>, which is less extensive than the expanded Battle Frontier in <em>Platinum</em>, but still offers plenty of challenge and longevity. I love the sheer amount of space left to discover in the postgame; this island is like an extra enclosed region to explore. Currently, I&#8217;m undecided on whether I&#8217;ll dive straight into this after the Pokémon League, or take a break and come back at a later time.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14813" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I&#8217;m well acquainted with the celebratory feel of the Battle Zone island, and may well get drawn into playing it immediately! After the high of defeating the Pokémon League, it&#8217;s wonderful to realise there&#8217;s still so much left for your Pokémon and you to explore. The Battle Zone has a vacation vibe, especially as you initially take a ship to get there &#8211; and the music is also uplifting and energetic, for example Route 225, which feels like a burst of energy, complete with the iconic clapping (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQvx9STW1V0">go to 00:42 in this video</a>)! Overall, the Battle Zone has a celebratory feel, and adds a lot to the overall package of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. I&#8217;m excited for the character of Lucie to extend her adventure, and take her dual-themed team onwards and upwards!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Space and Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope with this post is that it shone a light on two things: the reasons that set this playthrough of <em>Diamond </em>apart, and more detail on why I have such a strong connection to <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. They are such special games to me personally, and for a long time, I&#8217;ve considered how to do that connection justice on this site. The 2023 post was a very cathartic one for me to write, and this post is an extension of that. It&#8217;s amazing how our personal circumstances can affect our thoughts on games (and other forms of media) &#8211; and I love hearing about these stories from other people too, as it often sparks positive discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14850" height="514" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827" width="827" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that down the line, I get to write another post about <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, talking about how the character of Lucie faced the Pokémon League, and then ventured into the postgame and Battle Zone. Down the line, I&#8217;ll likely inevitably play <em>Pokémon Platinum</em> again, and that&#8217;ll continue to be the game I go back to for replaying Sinnoh.

This is the first brand new <em>Mario Kart</em> on consoles since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> on Wii U back in 2014 (the Switch received an upgraded version, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, in 2017, which I skipped) &#8211; so at least for me personally, it&#8217;s felt a long time coming. Mixed in with the excitement of a brand new Nintendo console, it made the launch of <em>Mario Kart World</em> feel like a real event, especially when played with friends, which is where <em>Mario Kart</em> always excels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, in various different configurations: both on the TV and in handheld, in solo, local co-op, and online with a friend. Now, I&#8217;ve reached a point where I feel I can state a comprehensive opinion on the game, having experienced both the racing modes and the open world that&#8217;s a major selling point of this iteration of <em>Mario Kart</em>. My thoughts are overall very positive, but there are also some flawed aspects to the game  &#8211; but I&#8217;ll expand upon this more later on in the review. Without further ado then, let&#8217;s get into it!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Start Your Engines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it was the new-console glow, or perhaps it was that wait since <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, but launching into <em>Mario Kart World</em> for the first time felt distinctly special. The game encourages you straight into exploring the open world first; this consists of the various tracks connected by open spaces of road, field, water, desert, and more. What&#8217;s immediately remarkable about the game is just how gorgeous it looks, both in handheld but also especially when played on a 4K HDR TV &#8211; and whilst this isn&#8217;t new technology, it&#8217;s wonderful to play Nintendo games in such high fidelity via the Switch 2. The visual direction of <em>Mario Kart World</em> makes brilliant use of the new hardware, presenting a world full of vibrancy, colour, and personality &#8211; which is shown in the track designs, whether it&#8217;s the bustling Shy Guy Bazaar, the scrumptious Sky-High Sundae, or the fiery Bowser&#8217;s Castle, just to name three!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-17 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14727" height="574" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mkw_sgb_view.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14724" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14725" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_17.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The infused personality is evident in the roster of characters (complete with various different unlockable outfits). Returning are your usual suspects like Mario, Luigi, Peach, and so forth; additionally, there are plenty of newcomers, including minor enemies such as Konkdor and Cataquack, and even bit-part characters such as Dolphin and, of course, Cow! If you&#8217;ve seen any discourse about <em>Mario Kart World</em> since the initial announcement, you&#8217;ll know that the Cow and their adorable grin has captured the attention of the internet, and I&#8217;ve had a wonderful time watching the various memes and edits their inclusion has spawned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the characters have a range of changeable outfits too, which are unlocked by collecting Dash Food bags from vendors in races or the open world. It adds an extra way to differentiate the characters, ranging from punk rock biker looks to desert outfits and much more in between &#8211; and they can be combined with the plentiful different karts and bikes to create the aesthetic you&#8217;re looking for. A Photo Mode has been added in tandem with this, giving plentiful options for taking pictures that show off the world and characters as you see fit. Me being me, I&#8217;m sad that we got an Explorer outfit Toad but no actual Captain Toad&#8230; But there&#8217;s always time for that in DLC, hopefully!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14754" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A smorgasbord of Yoshi! Or Yoshis? Yoshies?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The attention to detail in both audio and graphic effects is especially apparent when you build up speed. Karts and bikes camber side-to-side when they hop and drift; tyres are spongey and visibly bounce and recoil according to the track surface; and sparks crackle off your vehicle as you drift and build up a boost, just to name a small handful of the details I&#8217;m talking about. I particularly like the tension of drifting around the sharpest corners, with the screen often tilting with you and making it extra satisfying to hit the apex. Plus, the music is noticeably exceptional, supplying a consistently energetic chorus that accentuates the gameplay &#8211; especially in the final unlockable tracks, which supply a climactic crescendo unlike any other I&#8217;ve experienced in <em>Mario Kart</em>. Overall, the whole experience is lifted by this pristine look and feel, whether it&#8217;s the relatively laid-back open world, or the competitive modes, where the palpable sense of momentum is most gripping. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a Knockout!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the &#8220;World&#8221; being a key selling point of the game, it&#8217;s still those core competitive modes that retained the tightest grip on my attention. Whilst the expected familiar selection of Grand Prix, custom VS, Battle, and Time Trial modes are all here, the game deserves credit for also introducing a brand new main mode to go alongside Grand Prix. This goes by the name of Knockout Tour, where 6 different tracks are combined together into one extra-long race. It takes advantage of the increased count of 24 racers to introduce checkpoint gates along the way, eliminating those at the back each time. Essentially, it&#8217;s a way of introducing popular battle royale-esque sensibilities into <em>Mario Kart</em>, and it creates a very fun sense of chaos &#8211; especially in local multiplayer, when your friends and you are desperately trying to stay in the race amidst the various items flying around!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14736" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A road trip across the Mushroom Kingdom! Thankfully, less traffic jams than real life</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Knockout Tours are arguably the biggest challenge awaiting completionist solo players in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It&#8217;s classic knowledge now that to get the maximum 3-star rating in Grand Prix, you need to win all four races; but in Knockout Tour, you need to be leading through every single checkpoint! This is an extremely tough task, as it necessitates not just victory, but to be consistently leading &#8211; even despite homing Red Shells, or the dreaded blue Spiny Shells that target the leader. I set myself the personal challenge of 3-starring every Knockout Tour, and it led to many failed attempts, but it was highly satisfying when I finally achieved that goal. For <em>Mario Kart</em> veterans, it&#8217;s a good addition to have a target that takes this extra level of dedication to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just mentioned the items and the chaos synonymous with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and that side of the game is just as entertaining (and frustrating) as ever before! To me, <em>Mario Kart</em> is similar to other games such as <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> because at their core, each iteration is built on the same gameplay loop, and it makes it tough to critique a new entry &#8211; on one hand, it&#8217;d be unwise to stray too far from what makes the series so immensely popular, but on the other, there has to be enough new ideas to justify a new game that still feels imaginative.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-18 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14737" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14738" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14740" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As aforementioned, the Knockout Tours are a standout way in which <em>Mario Kart World</em> achieves the latter, and some of these ideas bleed over into Grand Prix, where you don&#8217;t just drive around four tracks &#8211; instead, after the first race, the initial laps are rolling starts, as you drive across the world to the next track, road-trip style. It&#8217;s a neat way to keep the same formula but match it to the open-world aesthetic of <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and in VS there are options to play either in this mode, or with the traditional laps, catering to either preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further to this, there are tweaks to the racing itself, the most notable arguably being the new parkour/trick abilities. If you drive up onto a rail, you can grind along it and perform extra trick boosts, and you can even trick onto a wall and wall-ride along it, which opens up jaw-dropping shortcuts if you master this ability (there are plenty of astonishing clips doing the rounds online)! On top of this, drifting boosts can now be used in a straight line, and launch you off the ground slightly to help initiate some of these parkour moves. In combination, all these extra options elevate the height of the skill ceiling, and keep <em>Mario Kart World</em> engaging for those who have mastered previous entries in the series. Crucially, it does this without losing the accessibility as a go-to local multiplayer party game &#8211; the extra skills are a cherry on top for those who want to go above and beyond, but they&#8217;re not essential for winning races against the CPU.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14755" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Boo Cinema is another standout track, which applies a film filter to part of the course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Items are one of the infamous levellers of <em>Mario Kart</em>, and there have been some tweaks and additions on this front too. Your usual roster of shells, bananas, and mushrooms, and more are all here, although it&#8217;s noticeable that the raw power of items such as Bullet Bill have been slightly softened, perhaps to accommodate the new racer count of 24. Some of the notable new items include the golden Coin Shell, which leaves a trail of coins behind it, and the feather, which leaps you into the air, opening another opportunity to perform tricks, wallrides, and other shortcuts. To more literally aid more inexperienced players, there are still the helpful options for motion controls, auto-accelerate, and driving aids. Whilst these aren&#8217;t new, they&#8217;re still great to see return, and are often essential for balanced 4-player sessions that everyone can enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Give Me a Boost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As fun as <em>Mario Kart</em> can be in solo play, multiplayer is where the series has always shined brightest, and that continues to be the case for <em>World</em>. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to play with several combinations of friends, and the game has impressively accommodated their varying levels of <em>Mario Kart</em> experience each time, whether they&#8217;re a fresh newcomer or someone who&#8217;s been away from the series for a while. It&#8217;s easy to criticize the items when they&#8217;re hitting you, but they do a great job at helping those towards the back stay with the pack, and there&#8217;s still the option to use items such as shells and bananas defensively whilst in the lead.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14743" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Expect to shout at your friends &#8211; in a pleasant way, of course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Local multiplayer has consistently resulted in a brilliant time, complete with the playful shouting, cheers, and competitive back-and-forth that you hope for from <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; so I can report that it&#8217;s a success in that department! My favourite local multiplayer option is the extended custom VS modes, which have plenty of customisable options, including speed, difficulty, item frequency, and the amount of races, which go up to 32 at a time. As a big Formula 1 fan, I love to nerd out about the accumulated points and the drama of how the final standings will end up, so VS will inevitably become my most-played mode!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of online play, <em>Mario Kart World</em> doesn&#8217;t quite hit the same heights as local multiplayer, because of that lack of immediate in-person reaction &#8211; and whilst it&#8217;s admirable that Nintendo has added chat functionality, I did end up defaulting to using a Discord call instead, because of the familiarity and ease of use. The main motivation to play online is to raise your versus rating (VR), which is essentially the same system we had way back on <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>. In my opinion, it&#8217;s disappointing that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added more reasons to play online, especially in a gaming landscape where online games consistently add new modes, tournaments, and other rewards for playing consistently. The end result is that I quickly fell off of online multiplayer, and have focused mostly on solo and local multiplayer.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14753" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Driving on water supplies opportunity to perform tricks as you bounce over the waves</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, I found that the returning Battle Mode was most ideal for multiplayer &#8211; in <em>World</em>, there are two options, Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, which will be familiar to players of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. Balloon Battle gives you five balloons to protect whilst doing your best to hit opponents and earn points for removing their balloons, and Coin Runners has you searching for as many coins as you can, whilst again attempting to hit others and remove their coins (whilst avoiding them doing the same to you). I have to say, I&#8217;ve never been a huge Battle Mode fan over the years, and this version hasn&#8217;t changed that &#8211; but conversely, if you love Battle Mode, this will fill that quota well. My main disappointment is that the modes are time-based instead of score-based, as I generally prefer having that concrete target and the tension of seeing who can reach it first. Despite my criticisms, I am glad Battle Mode is back, as it offers a welcome change of pace from the racing modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Free as a Birdo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, a major differentiator for <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the inclusion of a free roam mode, where you can explore the tracks (and the spaces between them) at your leisure. There&#8217;s certainly an immediate novelty to this &#8211; I have nostalgic memories of <em>LEGO Racers 2</em>, which I played a lot on PC as a child, and included a similar experience of exploring an open world between races in a colourful, family-friendly world. My hope was that <em>Mario Kart World</em> might recapture that whimsical feeling, and supply a world with plenty of secrets and rewards, and most importantly motivation to find them. At first, <em>World </em>is successful in this; one of my earliest ventures was rocking up to the Dino Dino Jungle area, and visiting the inner laboratory/auditorium section. With precise driving and the careful use of tricks, you can make your way to the top of this area &#8211; which is thrilling the first time, but soon the realisation kicks in that there&#8217;s a lack of reason to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-19 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14746" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14747" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14745" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in free roam,<em> Mario Kart World </em>has an uncanny sense of emptiness, and it&#8217;s partly because that palpable sense of forward energy &#8211; which is so prevalent in the competitive modes &#8211; is gone, without being replaced by much else. It&#8217;s not that there isn&#8217;t anything to do in the open world &#8211; for example, there are Peach Medallions and Question Mark Panels to find, as well as P Switches that activate various challenges &#8211; but the problem is that there isn&#8217;t much motivation to track all these things down. The main rewards are stickers, which are small graphic icons you can attach next to your profile name, and feel inconsequential. More work needed to be done to make the world feel alive, and not just like a suspended state of limbo from the Grand Prix mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toads and Shy Guys milling around and making campfires are a great touch, but they&#8217;re another short-lived novelty that doesn&#8217;t add substance to the experience of navigating the open world. It&#8217;s fun to find items and complete challenges, but they&#8217;re incredibly scattered &#8211; and whilst there&#8217;s a tracker for the Question Mark Panels, there&#8217;s curiously no in-game indicator for how many Medallions or Switches are left to find (and also no statistics or records screen for other modes, either). On the other hand, something free roam does do well is increasing the level of awe the world has. You can travel a long way out into the ocean, and discover sea dragons, whales, and more, and I had a great time inspecting the scale of impressive courses such as DK Spaceport. As mentioned at the start of the review, <em>Mario Kart World</em> is a stunning game to look at and listen to, and the open world gives you more time to do just that.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14748" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>P Switch challenges often consist of time trials</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s a great shame that there&#8217;s no formal splitscreen multiplayer for the open world &#8211; there&#8217;s a partial workaround, by loading into an empty wireless mode lobby, but challenges are turned off, and it&#8217;s not at all optimal. In a game marketed on free roam, and in a series known for local multiplayer, it&#8217;s a disappointing oversight that significantly reduces the reason to play this way. I have occasionally played free roam in single-player as a laid-back secondary experience, for example when listening to a podcast or talking to friends &#8211; but it has untapped potential as a playground for friends to enjoy together, and honestly, I think this would&#8217;ve papered over many of my problems with the emptiness of the open world. Instead, more often than not, you&#8217;ll launch straight into Grand Prix, Knockout Tour, or VS, as that is where the most joyous parts of <em>Mario Kart World</em> reside.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to the end of this review, I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;ve flagged multiple issues I have with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; so I need to re-emphasize that this is a genuinely excellent <em>Mario Kart</em> game, that not only delivers the best-looking and best-sounding entry into the series, but has multiple new ideas and modes that make it feel distinct. Changeable character outfits, new trick mechanics, and especially the Knockout Tour mode supply fresh style that have made <em>World </em>my new go-to local multiplayer game, and a game I&#8217;ve spent many an enjoyable hour in by myself as well. The main disappointment has to be the free roam mode, which feels sparse and quickly struggles to retain player attention &#8211; and I really hope that in the future, Nintendo supports the game with additional content that fills out this world more. Alternatively, add Captain Toad to the playable characters, and I&#8217;ll probably be happy, haha! In all seriousness, <em>Mario Kart World</em> definitely has flaws, but the core racing experience is dazzling, and it&#8217;s a superb way to start the Switch 2 era!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

I&#8217;ve written about this in multiple posts on this site, and I&#8217;ve noticed how I&#8217;m gradually getting deeper into the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> ecosystem: starting with looking back to the anime, and then playing the online game <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and now getting more invested in learning about the current meta and competitive side of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> is a complicated game with lots to learn (and relearn) for someone like me, who hasn&#8217;t been up-to-date on the meta since I stopped playing local tournaments about a decade-and-a-half-ago. But I&#8217;m slowly learning, and I&#8217;m enjoying how it&#8217;s happening naturally, via watching various YouTube creators, playing different decks in <em>Master Duel</em>, and even constructing a real-life deck that I could conceivably return to local tournaments with. So, in this post, I&#8217;m going to talk a little more about these various aspects of the game, the deck I&#8217;m playing, and why I&#8217;m enjoying this process so much!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Getting the Fire (Kings) Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve already written about <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/12/31/why-im-giving-yu-gi-oh-master-duel-another-shot/">how I&#8217;ve gotten back into <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em></a>, but only now have I reached the point where I&#8217;m starting to understand the competitive meta. At first, I was playing relatively low-powered (by current standards) decks such as Dark Magician and Monarchs, because those cards were familiar to me. But realistically, those decks aren&#8217;t fast-paced enough to keep up nowadays, so I started testing other avenues. I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of Gravekeepers, which can sometimes work in the competitive scene, if you draw the right cards (such as Necrovalley) in order to shut off abilities from the opponent. But this wasn&#8217;t a strategy that was going to help me learn the competitive game long-term, and I found that I eventually reached a point of repetition and subsequent burnout playing the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-20 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14664" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14665" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14666" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gravekeepers brought me a decent level of success!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This brought me to the HERO cards, especially Destiny HEROs, as I have a nostalgic affinity for them. The modern HERO cards have many combo effects that special summon various powerful cards, so they were much more helpful for learning the increased modern speed of combos in a deck. But I still found the HERO cards to lack flexibility for different situations, and I again reached a point where I hit a brick wall with the deck. It felt like I had hit also hit a wall in my efforts to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> in a contemporary fashion, as I couldn&#8217;t find a deck I clicked with. So I took a bit of a break from <em>Master Duel</em>, and started looking into which decks would be viable to assemble if I was playing the physical TCG (Trading Card Game). After looking at various Structure Decks as starting points, I finally found one which made sense to test out: Fire Kings!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire Kings are a deck based around monsters that destroy themselves either on the field, in the hand, or from the deck, to then activate various effects, including summoning monsters and destroying cards on the field. In addition, they have an impressive boss monster in &#8220;Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings&#8221;, which can destroy every other monster on the field (and has a magnificent summoning animation in <em>Master Duel</em>, see below)! The fiery aesthetic of these cards is well-realised in the stunning artwork, which mixes regal distinction with blazing power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-21 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14678" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14674" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14676" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14677" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14675" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Master Duel summon animations are, in a word, awesome</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the cards are relatively accessible in the real world, with only &#8220;Fire King Courtier Ulcanix&#8221; demanding a higher price point (of about £15 a copy). Most of the main Fire King cards can be acquired in the modestly priced Fire King Structure Deck &#8211; I bought three copies of this, as well as some other products (such as the recent Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Deck, which includes reprints of staple cards such as Infinite Impermanence), to construct a real-life Fire King deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, I find it helpful to have a real deck in front of me, which I can draw test hands with to slowly understand the playstyle better (I&#8217;m hoping for a reprint of Ulcanix, so I don&#8217;t have to drop £45-ish on a playset)! The result of this process is finally finding an archetype I like, which is viable to build in both <em>Master Duel</em> and the TCG &#8211; and to top it all off, Fire Kings are competitively strong too! Whilst they aren&#8217;t currently considered a top tier deck like Maliss or Ryzeal, Fire Kings do perform well in current competitive play, even winning the YCS Birmingham event this year, piloted by Dinh-Kha Bui! This tells me that if I can improve my own skill and understanding of the deck, then Fire King can reach a high ceiling of play in both <em>Master Duel</em> and local tournaments (should I decide to go&#8230; More on that later)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14669" height="696" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>It needs some changes still, but my TCG Fire King deck is taking shape!</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m playing lots of Fire King in Ranked games on <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and with every game, every new scenario, and every mistake I make (I&#8217;m admittedly still making a lot of those), I&#8217;m learning the intricacies of the deck, how to perform the best combos, and how to make the strongest boards in combination with my Extra Deck of Link, XYZ, and Synchro Monsters. I like how Fire Kings have such a strong Fire connection, which enables them to make use of several non-Fire cards as additions to the deck. For example, a common choice for Fire Kings is &#8220;Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames&#8221;, which can revive back one of your Fire Kings alongside it when summoned. This synergy is very satisfying, and ties into the overall theme of the deck, resulting in an archetype that feels richly-designed and well-realised. I&#8217;m enjoying learning the Fire King strategies, and I hope that by my next <em>Master Duel</em> post on this site, I can report that I&#8217;ve become steadily better at piloting the deck!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Creators I Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside my own proactive efforts to become better at contemporary <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I&#8217;ve been watching several YouTube creators that are a brilliant source of both entertainment and knowledge for me. <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/">In previous posts, I&#8217;ve mentioned</a> how TGS Anime and Team APS helped me get reacquainted with classic <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, which lines up with my aforementioned play of anime decks such as Dark Magician. I still watch these channels, but I&#8217;ve added several others to my regular watchlist, including the &#8220;wonky quartet&#8221; of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGuDrveqBgD0S9nqaOPw6Q">Farfa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MBTYuGiOh">MBT</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Nyhmnim">Nyhmnim</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dzeeff">Dzeeff</a>, who consistently create great content focused primarily around <em>Master Duel</em>. Often, they add fun variables to challenge themselves, such as in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xajsij7iS98">Master Chef</a> series by MBT, or the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbldWY88--A">Storage Wars</a> series by Farfa.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Videos like this (by Joshua Schmidt) are brilliant at showcasing both the fun and skill of </em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly thanks to these channels and their collaborations, I&#8217;ve also become aware of other popular YouTubers &#8211; specifically, ones focused around high-level competitive play. These are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaSchmidtYGO">Joshua Schmidt</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jessekottonygo">Jesse Kotton</a>, who are well-known for often winning or placing highly in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> tournaments. Both of them balance speaking confidently about modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> with also making videos that are fun to watch, which is very impressive and makes them stand out. Both their channels have been helpful to me, and I also like it when they have those earlier-mentioned collaborations with channels like Farfa and MBT, as they bring a little bit of extra seriousness to those videos. Discovering this range of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> players and creators has been an unexpected extra positive side effect of getting back into the game and franchise!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">It&#8217;s Time to Duel?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;ve talked about how I&#8217;ve not just been looking at the digital version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> (with <em>Master Duel</em>), but also my physical collection of cards as well. I have a fairly large amount of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> cards, mostly from my childhood and teenage years, and further supplemented with occasional more recent purchases when something has stood out to me. Those Fire King and Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Decks have given me access to plenty of modern cards to assemble a deck with, and I also picked up products like the Duel Devastator set from 2019, which was full of guaranteed competitive staples like &#8220;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&#8221;. This is all to say that I&#8217;m nearing a place where not only am I improving at <em>Master Duel</em>, but I could conceivably go to an in-person event near me and test out my skills in person (scary, I know, haha)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14673" height="672" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Recent structure decks have been ideal for helping me build Fire Kings</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Jokes aside, there&#8217;s only a few things stopping me from doing this, and one of them is overcoming that social anxiety. I&#8217;ve become better at this over the years, but I definitely find the initial ice-breaking of heading to a new club/group quite daunting. About a year ago, I also experienced this when joining a nearby running club &#8211; there is that initial awkward stage of getting to know people and faces, but it gets easier over time. I&#8217;m confident that this wouldn&#8217;t be a long-term issue, especially as I now know a friend who has introduced me to a local store that hosts Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next barrier is more closely related to the theme of this post &#8211; and that&#8217;s a personal target to be relatively well-acquainted with the game before showing up to a local tournament again. I&#8217;m definitely nearing this stage, and part of this preparation would be making the finishing touches to my Fire King deck. I&#8217;d like to get that playset of three Fire King Courtier Ulcanix first, as they&#8217;re integral to the strength of the deck. The card is out of stock on most sites, and my best route currently seems to be waiting for a good UK price on Cardmarket. I could wait and hope for a cheaper reprint, but there is no sign of this happening at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jesse Kotton has a video about Fire Kings and their affordability</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I&#8217;d like to get a copy of some extra staple Extra Deck cards such as &#8220;S:P Little Knight&#8221;, and possibly acquire some extra non-Fire King cards that often seen play in the deck, such as &#8220;Bystial Magnamhut&#8221; and &#8220;Bystial Druisworm&#8221;. The main thing I&#8217;m keeping an eye on is price &#8211; for example, in an ideal world I&#8217;d also add competitively strong cards such as &#8220;Mulcharmy Fuwalos&#8221; to the deck, but that would cost another £70-ish for a playset, and I haven&#8217;t even gone to a local event yet (I do have a tendency for overthinking)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve still not decided if I&#8217;ll make the time to make the leap to playing the TCG in-person again, but I&#8217;m getting increasingly tempted to have a go. It would enable me to test out my skills, and it could also be a way to make new friends and connections. When I went to local events in my teenage years, I enjoyed the trading side of the game too &#8211; and who knows, perhaps that&#8217;s a better way to acquire some of these missing cards for my Fire King deck. If I do decide to go, I hope to write up about my experience on this site, however well (or badly, haha) it goes!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the third <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> centric post I&#8217;ve written over the last 8 months, and they&#8217;re good reflections of how I&#8217;ve gotten back into the franchise as a whole: not just my nostalgic connection, but how I&#8217;ve been learning about the modern game and how it&#8217;s evolved over time. I admittedly used to be someone who lamented that <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> had become too complicated and suffered from power creep &#8211; and whilst those aren&#8217;t completely untrue, I think they were oversimplifications on my part. Having now taken the time to ingrain myself back into the world of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I see that the game has developed into something new &#8211; something faster, more complex, and in some ways arguably better than before.</p>\n\n\n\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top: 75%;">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this post has explained how I&#8217;m pushing myself to get better at the game, with the conduit of a Fire King deck as my resource for playing the game at a higher skill level than before. I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn still, both about this deck and other decks, but I&#8217;m having an excellent time doing so &#8211; which is probably evidenced by me considering playing the TCG in-person again at some point in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this post, and I sincerely hope you are happy, healthy, and having a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/03/how-fire-kings-are-helping-me-learn-competitive-play-in-yu-gi-oh-master-duel/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Right then, let&#8217;s get into the post, and I hope you enjoy the read!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Edinburgh Marathon 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/">my build-up and training for the Edinburgh Marathon</a> multiple times since I started planning in November 2024, and after a train journey up to Edinburgh and a couple of days in the city, on May 25th 2025 the day finally arrived for my first marathon! My parents and some close friends were there to support me, and I also had the support of all those who contributed to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">my charity fundraiser for Beat</a> (the Eating Disorder charity). Thank you to everyone who donated or even just took a look at my Justgiving page &#8211; I&#8217;m really proud to spread awareness for a charity that means a lot to both my family and I.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14636" height="607" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So, you may be asking, how did the marathon go? It was a tough one, and Scotland threw all the elements at us. There were periods of sun, rain, strong winds, and even hail when I reached approximately mile 20! As expected, the last 10-ish miles are where the battle really begins, as much mental as physical. It was important to me that I do my absolute best and never stop or walk if I can help it, and at mile 25 I got to see my friends and family cheer me on as I neared the finish line!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was an unexpectedly dramatic finish. With the finish line in sight, and as I pushed for the line with maybe 100 metres left to go, I was struck with the notorious &#8220;jelly legs&#8221; and fell. I managed to get back to my feet with the help of another nearby runner, and made it to the line. As someone who is very critical of themselves, I was disappointed at not finishing the run in better style &#8211; and this is where my family and friends were invaluable at stopping me from being too harsh on myself. It was a great reminder of how much they care for me and how much support I had on the day, and I am incredibly grateful to them and everyone else who has congratulated me since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-22 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14624" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Early on&#8230; !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14622" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the race</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14623" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final stretch!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Including Gift Aid, we raised £1,821.77 for Beat, and I&#8217;m very proud of this, as well as the personal achievement of finishing the marathon. I&#8217;m still deciding whether or not to do another marathon &#8211; after not finishing in quite the way I hoped, I am feeling motivated to do another one, maybe the Norfolk Marathon in 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest gaming news stories over the last few months has been the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. As not only a gaming fan but also specifically a Nintendo fan, I got my console immediately, and have been playing it a significant amount since! Whilst it&#8217;s more of an iteration than a revolution in terms of hardware, I personally enjoy the larger console and screen size, as it fits my larger hands very well. The only exclusive game I have so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I&#8217;ve put many an hour into!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14620" height="534" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, <em>Mario Kart World</em> feels like the first new entry since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> many years ago, as I played a lot of the latter on Wii U and never felt the need to buy the <em>Deluxe</em> version on Switch. Therefore, <em>World</em> feels very fresh to me, and it&#8217;s also visually spectacular (especially on a big 4K HDR TV). I&#8217;ve 3-starred all the Grand Prix and am now working away at the Knockout Tours, which are battle-royale style checkpoint races new to this game. These Knockout Tours are very tough to get 3-stars on, but I&#8217;m enjoying the challenge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a few criticisms of the game &#8211; including my own biased disappointment at no inclusion of Captain Toad, haha &#8211; but also about the open-world twist on the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula. In concept, it&#8217;s a smart way to go, but I have mixed feelings on the execution, as the world feels a little empty and repetitive to explore. Despite this, I&#8217;m going to save my full thoughts, as I plan to write a dedicated review at some point soon. One thing is for sure, and that&#8217;s <em>Mario Kart World</em> being the new go-to local multiplayer game for my friends and I!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the Switch 2 itself, it does feel like an investment for the future, as outside of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and now <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> (which I hope to play soon), there&#8217;s a lack of headline exclusive titles. But for now, the hardware upgrade and promise for the future &#8211; plus the fun of <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; has made it feel worth the purchase for this Nintendo fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-text-align-left">My watching habits have been quite eclectic recently! In terms of the films, the standout has to be <em>Superman</em> &#8211; as a huge DC fan, I had high hopes for this fresh, brighter take on the iconic character, and James Gunn and company thoroughly delivered. The film is a shining beacon of positivity, fun, and creativity, and David Corenswet is a brilliant Superman to centre the new DCU around. I&#8217;m very excited to see where things go in the future, but for now I&#8217;m just so happy that we got a satisfyingly hopeful take on Superman again. I&#8217;m hoping that these vibes continue in <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> on the Marvel side, which I&#8217;m going to see tomorrow as of writing this!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-23 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14617" height="1023" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg?w=819" width="819" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14618" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg?w=691" width="691" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of TV, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to <em>The Walking Dead</em> (I really liked the recent film <em>28 Years Later</em>, and I think it&#8217;s helped put me in the zombie mood). I originally stopped watch <em>The Walking Dead</em> in Season 8, which is where a lot of people dropped off, in the war between Rick and Negan. However, I heard that it picks up afterwards, so I decided to go back, charge through Season 8, and see what I find in those last few seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst Season 8 remains a poorly-paced season, I&#8217;m glad I went back, especially because Season 9 is brilliant TV. Clearly lessons were learned from the negative reception to previous seasons, and Season 9 focuses back on character development, inventive new threats, and grounded emotional stakes. It hooked me in and I&#8217;m enjoying the ride of these last few seasons!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m already looking ahead to watching the newer <em>The Walking Dead</em> spin-offs such as <em>The Ones Who Live</em> and <em>Daryl Dixon</em>, to see where these characters end up. Other than <em>The Walking Dead</em>, I&#8217;m also slowly making my way through the latest Marvel show <em>Ironheart</em>, which hasn&#8217;t been marketed very well by Disney &#8211; which is a shame, as it&#8217;s very well-made and full of great performances.  To loop back around to <em>Superman</em> and the DCU, I&#8217;m also eagerly anticipating <em>Peacemaker</em> Season 2, which will tie into that film and the larger world!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this summation of some of what I&#8217;ve been up to recently! One of my goals for the rest of the year is to start writing here more consistently &#8211; I&#8217;ve been saying this for a while, but it&#8217;s something I really want to get back to. It&#8217;s been necessary for me to spend more time on my personal life and take breaks from writing, but in the process of that personal growth, it&#8217;s reminded me how much I like writing about the things I play, watch, and do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I often get distracted or hit writer&#8217;s block, so I&#8217;m considering the approach of setting aside a little bit of time every day to write with no background music/videos, as opposed to my previous strategy of writing in big time chunks all at once. Either way, I&#8217;m planning to be more present on here in the second half of the year, and I look forward to it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sincerely hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a wonderful day!

Many hours of my weekends have been devoted to building up my distance; I am a longtime runner, but had never ran more than a half-marathon before my marathon training this year. Last weekend I did my longest run, a 23.2-miler (my poor legs), and I&#8217;m now tapering down before the big day. My mental health has been low recently, and the marathon has been a good target for my mind to try and focus on, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14584" height="560" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025"><em>https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m both excited and nervous for the event, for which I will be journeying to Edinburgh a few days beforehand. I&#8217;m also doing the run to fundraise for <a href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/">Beat, the Eating Disorder charity</a> &#8211; this is a cause close to my heart, as my amazing sister Charlotte passed away in 2007 after battling anorexia. As aforementioned in my previous post, you can view my Justgiving page <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">at this link</a>, and any donations would be very much appreciated, but there&#8217;s no pressure at all to donate!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Upcoming Book Projects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a designer for Titan Books, I get to work on some really exciting projects, and honestly that fulfilment in my work means a lot to me &#8211; it&#8217;s very rewarding to have a physical product of your work, especially when it&#8217;s related to a property (such as Marvel or <em>Star Trek</em>) that you enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get to experience working on several exciting film retrospectives, and some upcoming ones from Titan include books on <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>,<em> </em>The Crow films, and <em>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</em>, which you can see covers for below!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-24 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14562" height="904" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706" width="706" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14564" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800" width="800" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14563" height="927" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of fiction, the final Mike Hammer novel <em>Baby, It&#8217;s Murder</em> released recently, and there are upcoming Marvel paperbacks for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Annihilation</em> and <em>Doctor Strange: Dimension Wa</em>r.

I&#8217;m very impressed by what was shown, and have my pre-order in for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. Whilst I like physical media, I can&#8217;t justify that high £74.99 price point for buying <em>Mario Kart</em> separately. Those game prices are the main criticism so far &#8211; the only other hesitation is seeing Nintendo choose surety over innovation in terms of hardware. I&#8217;m confident the Switch 2 will be a huge hit, but I do slightly miss those eclectic reveals of the Wii U, 3DS, Wii, DS, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what I&#8217;m playing, I&#8217;ve been struggling with burnout and game-playing-motivation recently, so haven&#8217;t played much. I have however briefly gotten back into<em> Bravely Default</em> on the DS (which ironically has a Switch 2 version coming soon), and continue to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel </em>now and then. I&#8217;m hoping my game-playing motivation returns soon, but am also not putting too much pressure on myself, as I don&#8217;t want to force it. I look forward to the Switch 2 hopefully reigniting that fire a bit &#8211; oh, and please add Captain Toad to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, Nintendo! It would make me very happy indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve admittedly struggled to get back into games recently &#8211; but when it comes to TV, I&#8217;ve been keeping more up-to-date, and there&#8217;s a lot that I&#8217;ve been liking recently! The second season of <em>Andor </em>and second (or fifteenth, depending on how you count) season of <em>Doctor Who</em> are currently airing, and both are fantastic. <em>Andor </em>continues the engrossing drama and brilliantly tangible visual design of the first season, and this era of <em>Doctor Who</em> is really hitting a stride, with unexpected surprises amidst the brilliantly imaginative stories. I really hope the rumours of <em>Doctor Who</em> taking a break after this season are false, as Ncuti Gatwa is sensational, portraying a charismatic and emotionally healed Doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also just finished watching through <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Netflix-verse of Marvel TV (especially<em> Jessica Jones</em>), so to see some of those characters returning has been wonderful. The series feels like both a reinvention and a continuation of the original three <em>Daredevil </em>seasons, and I&#8217;ve been thrilled by how well it has turned out. The character work, cinematography, and courtroom/political intrigue is all here, and I am stoked for Season 2 &#8211; I just hope some of the Defenders do turn up in Season 2, including not just Jessica Jones, but Luke Cage and Iron Fist too!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a quick rundown on what I&#8217;ve been doing, playing, and watching! I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this quick update &#8211; I think of this site like my own digital journal, so even when I take a break, I always like to come back with some sort of update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really hope you are happy and healthy, and that you are having a wonderful week. See you next time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mikehammer_babyitsmurder_fc.jpg?w=666', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/81tvyzi3mvl._sl1500_.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doctorstrange_dimensionwar_salescover-1.jpg?w=678', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/godzillamovienovelization_omnibus_salescvr_dec24.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}]}

With such an expansive and imaginative open world, it&#8217;s a double-edged sword when it comes to DLC; on one hand, you know people like this world, but on the other, you really have to make the expansion stand out from that world to set it apart. For <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, this is done with a new area named The Cut, full of cold weather, dangerous new machines such as the Scorcher, and intriguing story reveals that bridge the gap between <em>Zero Dawn</em> and the sequel <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/03/30/horizon-forbidden-west-review/">Forbidden West</a></em> (incidentally, the only reason I haven&#8217;t included the <em>Forbidden West</em> DLC on this list is because I don&#8217;t have a PS5 to play it on)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cut is full of activities for main character Aloy, whether it be exploration, narrative, or combat &#8211; including optional super-hard combat trials for the real masochists among us. The local tribe (named the Banuk) tie into the aforementioned overarching story, and as Aloy discovers literal machinations under the snow-covered surface of The Cut, it increased my anticipation around where the sequel will go next &#8211; which is surely a sign of a successful DLC. When I wrote <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/02/14/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds-review/">my review for <em>The Frozen Wilds</em></a> back in 2018, I also noted how it made small steps to improve dialogue animations (which were sometimes quite static in the main game), and you can see how that was continued to full fruition in the dynamic conversations of <em>Forbidden West</em>. Not only is <em>The Frozen Wilds</em> substantial and utterly beautiful to look at, but it actively improves the gameplay foundation of a series I adore.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Mass Effect 3: Leviathan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious choices when it comes to <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC are the fantastic <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> for <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, or the <em>Citadel </em>DLC that served as an epilogue for <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. However, the expansion I have the strongest personal connection to is <em>Leviathan</em>, the first of the <em>Mass Effect 3</em> DLCs. I only bought an Xbox 360 shortly before <em>Mass Effect 3</em> launched, and that game was my gateway into the series (I went back and played the entire trilogy afterwards). After mainly playing on Nintendo consoles beforehand, the concept of single-player expansions was relatively foreign to me &#8211; but after being so enraptured by <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, I was incredibly excited at the prospect of more story content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ending of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is infamous for being disappointing to many people &#8211; but in a way, it made me more excited for DLC that would further flesh out the backstory of the giant world-destroying Reapers that you face throughout the trilogy. <em>Leviathan </em>is all about the discovery of a secret race named (you guessed it) Leviathans, who predate even the mysterious Reapers. In the DLC, you journey across space to piece together morsels of information about their origins. I particularly like the planet 2181 Despoina, a planet covered in water and full of secrets and intense combat situations. That sense of discovering places that were meant to be hidden forever is thrilling, especially when you get to the climactic moments that reveal how the Leviathans play into the wider battle against the Reapers &#8211; and it&#8217;s that rush of energy that makes <em>Leviathan </em>stand out as my favourite <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker &#8211; Special Episode</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very happy when <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> got a Switch release, as it allowed even more people to play this gem of a game &#8211; and I was even happier when in early 2019, a new selection of levels was added with the <em>Special Episode</em> expansion! Whilst this isn&#8217;t a large single-player story expansion like some of the other games I&#8217;ve included in this list, I wanted to highlight this DLC for <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, as it&#8217;s a joyful addition with plenty of value for money (currently £5.39 on Switch). Also, yes, I&#8217;m biased for Captain Toad, but that&#8217;s besides the point, aha&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who haven&#8217;t played <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, it&#8217;s a delightful puzzle game that sees Captain Toad and Toadette make their way through levels based on Hakoniwa Japanese box gardens, with the player rotating and shifting the levels around in order to progress. The <em>Special Episode</em> adds 5 brand new levels and 13 challenges that reinvent previous courses, so 18 new levels to play through in total. As with the main game, there&#8217;s a lovely variety, from haunted caves full of Boos, to a treacherous ship, to another minecart ride! As <em>Treasure Tracker</em> is presented in several book chapters, the DLC additions fit in smoothly, and I&#8217;d frankly happily play as many levels as Nintendo is happy to add (I really hope we get a sequel one day)! The <em>Special Episode</em> is a wonderful and endearing addition to <em>Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Dragon Age: Inquisition &#8211; Trespasser</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a brilliant time with all of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> DLCs, but it&#8217;s the final DLC <em>Trespasser </em>that&#8217;s my favourite of the bunch. Requiring story completion to play, it&#8217;s a definitive end &#8211; and cliffhanger &#8211; to <em>Inquisition</em>, even preventing you from returning to the main game afterwards. The plot brings the player to a summit assembled to decide what happens to the Inquisition now that the main threat has been ended, but soon a new conspiracy is discovered. This eventually reveals that Solas (an eleven mage who&#8217;s a consistent presence in the <em>Dragon Age</em> series) is secretly Fen&#8217;Harel and the Dread Wolf. He&#8217;s been responsible for many of the magical occurrences that have played a part in the game, and he&#8217;s now seeking to collapse the Veil that separates worlds, despite the catastrophic consequences it&#8217;d cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For players who&#8217;ve spent many hours around this character who they thought was on their side, it&#8217;s a dramatic reveal that created a lot of excitement for the sequel to <em>Inquisition</em>. Solas even cuts off the arm of the main character to prevent them stopping him, before disappearing and leaving the player with the decision of whether the Inquisition should be continued or disbanded. <em>Trespasser </em>does have competent combat elements too, but the story is the focus here, and it&#8217;s always been memorable thanks to the anticipation it created for the sequel. However, despite <em>Trespasser </em>releasing in 2015, we only got <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/08/04/dragon-age-the-veilguard-why-im-optimistic-what-id-like-to-see-next/">The Veilguard</a></em> at the end of 2024, so it did leave a lot of time for players to stew and theorize!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Resident Evil 5: Lost in Nightmares/Desperate Escape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I first played <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/02/resident-evil-5-review/">Resident Evil 5</a></em> in 2020, and I did so on PS4, where both the DLC expansions <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> and <em>Desperate Escape</em> are bundled in with the main game, so I&#8217;m going to include them both together for the purposes of this list. Whilst <em>Resident Evil 5</em> certainly has flaws, it also has a lot to praise, such as how it leans into cinematic storytelling. The two DLCs act as a prequel and an in-between-quel, and give an opportunity to play as series mainstay (and <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/23/my-5-favourite-video-game-characters/">my favourite <em>Resident Evil</em> character</a>) Jill Valentine, as well as the pilot Josh Stone. Firstly, <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> is set before <em>Resident Evil 5</em>, and shows Jill and Chris Redfield infiltrating the Spencer estate to confront Albert Wesker. We see snippets of this encounter &#8211; which leaves Jill presumed dead &#8211; during the main game as flashbacks, but here we get to play through it all: puzzles, combat, and Wesker boss fight included. Jill and Chris are the quintessential <em>Resident Evil</em> partners, so it&#8217;s comforting to see them interact (well, as comforting as it can be when facing down monstrosities).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Desperate Escape</em> is set towards the end of the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> campaign, just after Sheva Alomar and Chris manage to free Jill from the mind control of Wesker. Whilst the former pair go after Wesker in the main game, we never got to see how Jill and Josh made their own way out, and we get to play that out for ourselves here. This is arguably the tougher DLC of the two, less puzzle-focused and more about, well, desperately escaping &#8211; ending with a horde-assault sequence that gets frenetic on the higher difficulties. Both DLCs are great for different reasons, and as a combo add a lot to the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> story experience. Jill getting her time to shine is great too, especially as she wasn&#8217;t playable in the main game. This is timeline-wise the last time we got to play as Jill in the main story, too &#8211; please take the hint, Capcom&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The Last of Us: Left Behind</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You knew this had to be on here, right? In my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> rose the bar for story expansions, just like <em>The Last of Us</em> rose the bar for narrative video games. <em>Left Behind</em> fits into the later portions of <em>The Last of Us</em>, after Joel is near-fatally injured, and Ellie is hunting for medical supplies in an abandoned mall. This forms part of Left Behind, but it&#8217;s also interspersed with flashbacks to three weeks before the main game, where Ellie is taken by her friend Riley to break into another abandoned mall in Boston &#8211; and this is where the DLC shines at its brightest. As with many of the other expansions in my list, the core gameplay is a solid continuation of the main game, but it&#8217;s the story advancements and believable character interactions which leave the strongest impact here, giving us brand new information on Elie and her backstory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the best parts of the DLC aren&#8217;t fighting infected, but instead when Riley and Ellie are exploring the desolate mall. They find carousels, video games, and plenty more to play with and talk about. The in-gameplay dialogue that <em>The Last of Us</em> uses so well is continued here, resulting in a moment between the two girls that is both natural and surprising, especially for blockbuster games at the time. It&#8217;s all interwoven with that bittersweet sense that something bad is going to happen &#8211; after all, this is an apocalyptic world, we didn&#8217;t hear much about Riley in the main game, and we know Ellie gets bitten at some point. Those moments do come, but they maintain all their dramatic impact because of the masterful way Naughty Dog combines gameplay and narrative (and also because of brilliant performances by Yaani King as Riley and Ashley Johnson as Ellie). As I said at the start &#8211; in my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> raised the bar for story expansions, and it&#8217;s still one of my favourites to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>With that, we come to the end of the list! As mentioned earlier, there are plenty other great DLC expansions out there, but these are six of my own favourites, each for their own specific reasons.

Therefore, I thought I&#8217;d give a quick overview of what&#8217;s been added to the game and why I&#8217;ve found it so rewarding!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Look to the Skies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s immediately obvious which archetype Konami is pushing with this event &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the Sky Strikers, who were introduced back in 2018 and have become incredibly popular since. The first two <em>Master Duel </em>anniversaries tied into Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so it&#8217;s admittedly a shame we don&#8217;t have a Red-Eyes Black Dragon event to round out the central three <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> Duel Monsters characters of Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey &#8211; but I suppose the power of the fan-favourite Sky Striker characters Raye and Roze was just too strong!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14502" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14515" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14519" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png" width="2560" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop is filled with new items featuring board backgrounds, player mates, card backs, a deck box, and more focused around the Sky Strikers, plus admittedly stunning alternate arts for the main Sky Striker cards. I&#8217;m not an expert on the archetype, but all the amazing artwork and shiny bonuses definitely has me intrigued to learn more about the characters!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of&#8230; The new solo Story is unsurprisingly focused around the Sky Strikers. However, what makes this even more special is the addition of animated sequences within the Sky Striker story, which have been taken from the upcoming anime <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME: THE CHRONICLES</em>. For those who don&#8217;t know, Konami recently announced that this anime will be starting in April 2025, and will be focused on the actual card lore itself. So, instead of revolving around duels (like <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em>, <em>5D&#8217;s</em>, or <em>Arc-V</em> did, for example), <em>CHRONICLES </em>will be set within the world of the cards, which is very exciting! It&#8217;s been announced that these episodes will include the archetypes Fall of Albaz, Dogmatika Ecclesia, and yes &#8211; Sky Strikers!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14505" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14507" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14508" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing small clips of the anime in the <em>Master Duel</em> solo mode was unexpected, and acts as a lovely tease of what&#8217;s to come. The animation is vibrant and expressive, and it&#8217;s great to see this willingness to expand on the card lore &#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely be checking these anime episodes out as they release. Also I have to mention that the new UI for the solo mode is much improved and more player-friendly, segmenting the various solo stories up in a cleaner way, which I appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Festival Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next major addition to <em>Master Duel</em> is the two Festivals that are happening this month &#8211; the first one, Legend Anthology, features a custom banlist that excludes common staples, such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. In theory, this shakes up the meta within the mode, especially with three pre-made decks ready for players to use. However, this mode is dominated by the new Exodia deck and cards, in particular The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate, which can reach upwards of 10000 ATK and can also negates card effects. Often, the match is decided on the coin flip, as if a player goes first and gets out this Exodia card, it&#8217;s extremely hard to the opponent to stage a comeback. Still, the mode has plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, so it&#8217;s worth grinding through.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14511" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14510" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14509" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m much more excited for the upcoming Fusion X Synchro Festival (starting 17th February), which will restrict the Extra Deck to only Synchro/Fusion monsters, and cut out all the options that Link and XYZ monsters have added. I&#8217;m growing to respect those newer card types more over time, but it&#8217;ll still be fun to play some games that make players revert to pre-XYZ strategies. Hopefully it&#8217;ll allow some of my older classic decks to be a bit more viable (at least briefly)! Just like the Legend Anthology, there are plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, which should make it worth the playtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Plenty of Prizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that has always pleasantly surprised me about <em>Master Duel</em> is how generous it is as a Free-to-Play game. The 3rd Anniversary is timed with the start of a new Duel Pass, which is a 700-Gem purchase that &#8211; if you complete it &#8211; earns you all your Gems back, as well as cosmetic and in-game currency rewards, such as a background themed around the aforementioned Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate. If I had to suggest improvements, it would be for a few more unique cosmetic rewards in the Pass &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to complain too much about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the Sky Striker items I mentioned earlier, the shop also has a new Structure Deck full of the expensive HERO cards, new Selection Packs that include those new Exodia cards, as well as another chance to buy previous Anniversary-exclusive items themed around Blue-Eyes White Dragon. As someone who took a long break from <em>Master Duel</em>, I appreciate this a lot, and am slowly working my way through acquiring these.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14517" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14512" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14514" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The deck that&#8217;s currently giving me the most success is my anti-meta Gravekeeper deck, which I&#8217;ve fine-tuned to include more drawing cards and be more reliable (see the decklist image above). I&#8217;ve also finally put together my Destiny HERO deck, which is more meta, and features more Extra Deck combo cards. For long-term success in <em>Master Duel</em>, I need to learn more of these combo plays (and how to combat other combo decks), so I don&#8217;t want to stick with anti-meta decks like Gravekeepers for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my quick summation of the new <em>Master Duel</em> features and how they&#8217;ve positively affected the game &#8211; I&#8217;m really enjoying the amount to do right now, as well as the continued support Konami is bringing. I&#8217;m still slowly re-acclimatising myself to <em>Master Duel</em> after such a long time away, but I&#8217;m continuing to enjoy it and play a few duels every day. If anyone else is intrigued in giving the game a shot, I&#8217;d say now is an ideal time to jump on board, as the game is offering many player-friendly rewards that not only play on nostalgia for <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, but also relate to future projects like the <em>CHRONICLES </em>anime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this quick article &#8211; and if you&#8217;re playing <em>Master Duel</em>, let me know how you&#8217;re finding it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}]}

The way villages grow organically, without a rigid grid, gives the game a unique feel, and balancing resources and villager needs is incredibly rewarding. Add in its gorgeous visuals, and I can already tell this is a city-builder I’ll be spending a lot more time with.</p><p>Of course, learning a new game like Foundation can be a challenge, and that’s where great content creators make all the difference. I’ve followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CityPlannerPlays" target="_blank">City Planner Plays</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://@cityplannerplays.bsky.social">@cityplannerplays.bsky.social</a>) for years—first for his Cities: Skylines content and later for his deep-dive How-To guides in other games. His approach is what makes him stand out: clear, structured instructions, useful background context, and a willingness to show his own mistakes when they serve as valuable lessons.</p><p>This post is as much a learning tool for myself as it is a guide for anyone new to the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, I’ve broken down City Planner Plays’ step-by-step instructions for starting a village, prioritizing buildings, and setting up a successful economy.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re diving into the game for the first time (or coming back like me), this should help you get started—and I highly recommend checking out his full video (below) for even more insights.</p><h2>How to Start Your Village in Foundation | by City Planner Plays</h2><div><h3><i>A step-by-step guide based on City Planner Plays\' gameplay.</i></h3></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><span><a name="more"></a></span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><u>1.

While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step. It takes the grand, operatic elements of Star Wars and grounds them in a reality where power is brutal, where ecological concerns dictate the survival of entire civilizations, and where messiahs are as dangerous as they are revered.</p><p>While Star Wars draws inspiration from many sources, including Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films, and Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey, the imprint of Dune is undeniable. Lucas mixed multiple influences to craft his space opera, resulting in a faster-paced, action-driven narrative compared to Dune’s more introspective and politically complex storytelling. If anything, Dune is a deep meditation on power, religion, and fate, while Star Wars leans into mythic adventure and the battle between good and evil.&nbsp;</p><p>Both have left an indelible mark on science fiction, shaping how we imagine galaxies far, far away.&nbsp;</p><p>Here\'s how the team at <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StarWarsExplained" target="_blank">Star Wars Explained</a></em> put it: <em>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Uz-lKT7Jc" target="_blank">How Dune Continues to Inspire Star Wars.</a>"</em></p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><p>In the end, simply know that for those who fell in love with Star Wars, Dune stands waiting—a richer, more demanding, but ultimately rewarding universe to explore.<br /><br />Further readings:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/star-wars-ripped-off-dune" target="_blank">How \'Star Wars\' ripped off \'Dune\'</a> - via The Week</li><li><a href="https://nerdist.com/article/everything-star-wars-borrowed-from-dune/" target="_blank">Everything STAR WARS Borrowed From DUNE</a> - via Nerdist</li><li><a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars-movies-wouldnt-exist-without-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Movies Definitely Wouldn’t Exist Without Dune</a> - via Den of Geek</li><li><a href="https://www.cbr.com/dune-star-wars-similarities-inspiration/" target="_blank">Dune: 10 Ways the Series Inspired Star Wars</a> - via CBR</li><li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonyorlando52/cool-dune-and-star-wars-comparisons" target="_blank">17 "Star Wars" And "Dune" Similarities That Seemingly Tie The Franchises Together</a> - via BuzzFeed</li><li><a href="https://gamerant.com/star-wars-was-based-on-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Was Based On Dune, And It Shows </a>- via Game Rant</li></ul><p></p></div>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq7tgJpqN-t3AdtgsPbsCw9nr-n-fGT077bVls28t9Lu_zvWivNPoomrDmXU5GKk-rvgPFZM_xSQVq8zWlVCOloEA1_kPCqJQuq2tWcx3bSekID1l8VTebx20UU39KimjohC-qAiYovrOJEqbS1oeajcXre8zQD-PYedtdbDWoUckG6ePMIiTkDQ/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202025-03-05%2008.50.03%20-%20A%20dramatic%20sci-fi%20landscape%20divided%20into%20two%20distinct%20halves,%20symbolizing%20two%20different%20universes.%20On%20the%20left,%20a%20vast%20desert%20planet%20with%20towering%20san.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq7tgJpqN-t3AdtgsPbsCw9nr-n-fGT077bVls28t9Lu_zvWivNPoomrDmXU5GKk-rvgPFZM_xSQVq8zWlVCOloEA1_kPCqJQuq2tWcx3bSekID1l8VTebx20UU39KimjohC-qAiYovrOJEqbS1oeajcXre8zQD-PYedtdbDWoUckG6ePMIiTkDQ/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202025-03-05%2008.50.03%20-%20A%20dramatic%20sci-fi%20landscape%20divided%20into%20two%20distinct%20halves,%20symbolizing%20two%20different%20universes.%20On%20the%20left,%20a%20vast%20desert%20planet%20with%20towering%20san.webp" width="640" /></a></div><br />Frank Herbert’s Dune and George Lucas’ Star Wars share a striking number of similarities, from their world-building to their overarching themes.

While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step. It takes the grand, operatic elements of Star Wars and grounds them in a reality where power is brutal, where ecological concerns dictate the survival of entire civilizations, and where messiahs are as dangerous as they are revered.</p><p>While Star Wars draws inspiration from many sources, including Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films, and Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey, the imprint of Dune is undeniable. Lucas mixed multiple influences to craft his space opera, resulting in a faster-paced, action-driven narrative compared to Dune’s more introspective and politically complex storytelling. If anything, Dune is a deep meditation on power, religion, and fate, while Star Wars leans into mythic adventure and the battle between good and evil.&nbsp;</p><p>Both have left an indelible mark on science fiction, shaping how we imagine galaxies far, far away.&nbsp;</p><p>Here\'s how the team at <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StarWarsExplained" target="_blank">Star Wars Explained</a></em> put it: <em>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Uz-lKT7Jc" target="_blank">How Dune Continues to Inspire Star Wars.</a>"</em></p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><p>In the end, simply know that for those who fell in love with Star Wars, Dune stands waiting—a richer, more demanding, but ultimately rewarding universe to explore.<br /><br />Further readings:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/star-wars-ripped-off-dune" target="_blank">How \'Star Wars\' ripped off \'Dune\'</a> - via The Week</li><li><a href="https://nerdist.com/article/everything-star-wars-borrowed-from-dune/" target="_blank">Everything STAR WARS Borrowed From DUNE</a> - via Nerdist</li><li><a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars-movies-wouldnt-exist-without-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Movies Definitely Wouldn’t Exist Without Dune</a> - via Den of Geek</li><li><a href="https://www.cbr.com/dune-star-wars-similarities-inspiration/" target="_blank">Dune: 10 Ways the Series Inspired Star Wars</a> - via CBR</li><li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonyorlando52/cool-dune-and-star-wars-comparisons" target="_blank">17 "Star Wars" And "Dune" Similarities That Seemingly Tie The Franchises Together</a> - via BuzzFeed</li><li><a href="https://gamerant.com/star-wars-was-based-on-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Was Based On Dune, And It Shows </a>- via Game Rant</li></ul><p></p></div>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-not-so-hidden-link-between-dune-and.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-not-so-hidden-link-between-dune-and.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq7tgJpqN-t3AdtgsPbsCw9nr-n-fGT077bVls28t9Lu_zvWivNPoomrDmXU5GKk-rvgPFZM_xSQVq8zWlVCOloEA1_kPCqJQuq2tWcx3bSekID1l8VTebx20UU39KimjohC-qAiYovrOJEqbS1oeajcXre8zQD-PYedtdbDWoUckG6ePMIiTkDQ/s72-w640-h366-c/DALL%C2%B7E%202025-03-05%2008.50.03%20-%20A%20dramatic%20sci-fi%20landscape%20divided%20into%20two%20distinct%20halves,%20symbolizing%20two%20different%20universes.%20On%20the%20left,%20a%20vast%20desert%20planet%20with%20towering%20san.webp', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened. That bizarre, campy mess deserves to be locked in a vault and yeeted into a black hole. A clone-Ripley with alien DNA? A Xenomorph with puppy dog eyes? No thanks. Some things are best left unacknowledged.</i>).&nbsp;</p><p>And then, decades later, Ridley Scott returned. He promised to answer those burning questions we’d had since Alien. He promised us something epic, something profound.</p><p>Instead, we got <b>Prometheus </b>and <b>Alien: Covenant</b>—films that thought they were profound, but mostly just left us shaking our heads, wondering how some of the dumbest people in the universe got sent on space missions.</p><p>Let’s talk about the prequels.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Prometheus: A Beautiful, Dumb Mystery</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/s1200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/w400-h200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p>Prometheus promised us a grand exploration of the origins of life and the Xenomorphs, wrapped in a sleek, high-concept sci-fi package. And visually? It delivered. The ship design was stunning, the interior dripping with that clean, industrial aesthetic that felt like a spiritual cousin to the Nostromo (well the crew quarters really), only way more advanced. The planetary storm sequence? Pure spectacle.&nbsp;</p><p>The Engineers?&nbsp;</p><p>Towering and mysterious—though, let’s be real, their proportions felt wonky, as if Ridley Scott couldn\'t quite decide whether they were gods or just really tall dudes in marble skin suits. <i>Do yourself a favour—go rewatch the scene where the crew of the Nostromo first stumbles upon the Space Jockey. Take a good look at the proportions. That thing is massive, ancient, and downright eerie. Now ask yourself: does an Engineer really seem big enough to fit that chair? Yeah, I didn’t think so either.</i></p><p></p><p>Performance-wise, Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron carried the film on their backs. Rapace brought intensity to her role as Elizabeth Shaw, a scientist driven by faith and curiosity, while Fassbender’s David was the perfect blend of unsettling and fascinating—an android more human than the humans around him. And Theron? Her cold, corporate badassery added a delicious layer of tension.</p><p>But for all the things "Prometheus" got right, its flaws loomed as large as the Engineer statues. The whole "our DNA comes from a space giant dissolving in a river" premise felt half-baked at best, eye-roll-inducing at worst. If the Engineers were supposed to be our creators, why was there zero effort to explain their motives? Why did they want to wipe out humanity? What was this planet even for? Instead of storytelling, we got vague hints and unanswered questions wrapped in pseudo-philosophical musings.</p><p>Then there was the crew—easily the dumbest collection of scientists and astronauts ever put on screen. Removing helmets in an alien environment? Playing "here, kitty kitty" with a clearly hostile alien snake thing? These people made the space truckers from Alien look like Nobel Prize winners. And the mutations—ugh. Fifield’s transformation into a rabid space zombie was laughably bad, and don’t even get me started on the grotesque, beige "proto-Alien" at the end. It looked like a half-melted action figure.</p><p>Oh, and that rolling Engineer ship? The fact that Vickers—who had been competent up until that moment—somehow forgot to run sideways and got pancaked was the cherry on top of this frustrating mess.</p><p>"Prometheus" was a film of incredible potential, weighed down by weak storytelling and infuriatingly dumb character decisions. It gave us glimpses of something greater but never had the courage to actually show us anything meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p>Visually breathtaking, thematically ambitious, but ultimately… a beautifully designed pile of nonsense.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Alien: Covenant: A Gore-Soaked, Half-Baked Hybrid</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/s1296/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/w400-h225/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>If <b>Prometheus </b>was Ridley Scott\'s attempt at deep, existential sci-fi, <b>Alien: Covenant</b> was his half-hearted apology to fans who just wanted some classic Xenomorph carnage. And to be fair, it sort of delivered. We got facehuggers, chestbursters, and plenty of gruesome deaths. But at what cost? The film felt like it was straddling two worlds—trying to bridge the philosophical musings of Prometheus with the horror elements of Alien—and it never really nailed either.</p><p></p><p>Let’s start with the good. Visually, Covenant was just as slick as its predecessor, with some beautifully haunting cinematography. The ship design was solid, the eerie desolation of the Engineer city was striking, and the alien-infested sequences had some intense, gory payoff. And, once again, Michael Fassbender absolutely crushed it—his dual role as the psychotic David and the more naive Walter was easily the most compelling part of the movie. The flute scene? Weird, but Fassbender made it work. "I\'ll do the fingering" may have been unintentionally hilarious, but it also cemented David as one of the most fascinatingly twisted characters in the franchise.</p><p>But then we get to the problems—and, oh boy, there are many.&nbsp;</p><p>The crew? Somehow even dumber than the ones in Prometheus. These were colonists tasked with establishing a new human home, yet they made every idiotic decision possible. Landing on an uncharted planet without hazmat suits? Poking at alien life forms again? Splitting up the team when they know there’s a hostile presence? It was like watching a slasher movie where the victims are actively trying to get themselves killed.</p><p>The Xenomorphs? They felt… off. The Neomorphs were creepy, but they never really lived up to the terror of the original creatures. And when we finally got to a full-fledged Xenomorph, the CGI just didn\'t have the same weight or presence as the practical effects from Alien and Aliens. Instead of lurking in the shadows, dripping menace, the creature just kind of… sprinted around like a hyperactive dog.</p><p>And then there was that twist. We all saw it coming a mile away—David taking Walter’s place—yet the movie played it like some grand revelation. The final scene, with Daniels realizing the truth as David smugly locked her into cryosleep, had so much potential to be chilling. But it was frustrating because it was just another rehash of the same “crew doomed by their own stupidity” trope we’d already seen before.</p><p><b>Alien: Covenant</b> had all the ingredients of a great sci-fi horror film, but it never fully committed to either its horror roots or its philosophical ambitions. It wanted to be both a blood-soaked monster movie and a deep meditation on creation and destruction, but instead, it ended up being a half-baked mash-up that pleased neither camp.&nbsp;</p><p>It was more entertaining than Prometheus, sure, but it was also proof that Ridley Scott had no clear idea where he was taking this franchise.</p><p>But don\'t take my word for it, here\'s a detailed analysis of the franchise\'s decline by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Hollywood_Lore" target="_blank">Hollywood Lore</a>.</p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">So, there might still be some hope...</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Cautiously Optimistic About Alien: Romulus</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidtRyYz6hMg7b_QNx5GcMacBuC66Pja9OW8Gpx_BVcF_EXerphaUU2fuCG09Tmwon4j7eUTNHdz1Z-bf1C5xtaY2kbD5PEbZaKcw_EjHipyyeMr2LgUJrLbg4YXg9RfdrRvYGU68IiJsFho2TymSc0_S5zIXuqjERXopv2X5qA5w3zLmWZpvmvaA/s1288/BRNM7LTMLVED5O7ZYI5CNIX6LI.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidtRyYz6hMg7b_QNx5GcMacBuC66Pja9OW8Gpx_BVcF_EXerphaUU2fuCG09Tmwon4j7eUTNHdz1Z-bf1C5xtaY2kbD5PEbZaKcw_EjHipyyeMr2LgUJrLbg4YXg9RfdrRvYGU68IiJsFho2TymSc0_S5zIXuqjERXopv2X5qA5w3zLmWZpvmvaA/w400-h225/BRNM7LTMLVED5O7ZYI5CNIX6LI.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>So, after the Prometheus-Covenant debacle, should we dare to hope again? Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair. The film is set between Alien and Aliens, with a new cast, a new setting, and—hopefully—a return to the franchise’s roots.</p><p></p><p>Now, full disclosure: I haven’t seen it yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But from what I’ve gathered, early reviews suggest that Álvarez might actually get it. Critics have praised the film for leaning into the claustrophobic horror that made the original Alien so iconic. The visuals are supposedly striking, the tension palpable, and Cailee Spaeny’s performance as the lead, Rain, has been getting solid buzz. If Álvarez managed to capture that creeping dread of the original—without bogging it down in over-explained mythology—then we might just have a winner.</p><p>That said, not all reviews are glowing. Some critics feel the film leans too hard on nostalgia, offering little that’s truly new to the franchise. Others have called out a controversial digital recreation of Ian Holm’s Ash, arguing that it adds more distraction than depth. And there’s always the risk that Romulus ends up feeling like a well-shot rehash rather than a true evolution of the saga.</p><p>So, am I hopeful?&nbsp;</p><p>Cautiously, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like <b>Alien: Romulus</b> might finally be the course correction we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p><p>But I won’t know for sure until I see it myself.&nbsp;</p><p>And when I do, you can bet I’ll be back with my thoughts.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/s1280/Alien(1979).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/w640-h360/Alien(1979).png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p>When Alien burst onto the screen in 1979, it was the kind of film that crawled under your skin and stayed there.

And visually? It delivered. The ship design was stunning, the interior dripping with that clean, industrial aesthetic that felt like a spiritual cousin to the Nostromo (well the crew quarters really), only way more advanced. The planetary storm sequence? Pure spectacle.&nbsp;</p><p>The Engineers?&nbsp;</p><p>Towering and mysterious—though, let’s be real, their proportions felt wonky, as if Ridley Scott couldn\'t quite decide whether they were gods or just really tall dudes in marble skin suits. <i>Do yourself a favour—go rewatch the scene where the crew of the Nostromo first stumbles upon the Space Jockey. Take a good look at the proportions. That thing is massive, ancient, and downright eerie. Now ask yourself: does an Engineer really seem big enough to fit that chair? Yeah, I didn’t think so either.</i></p><p></p><p>Performance-wise, Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron carried the film on their backs. Rapace brought intensity to her role as Elizabeth Shaw, a scientist driven by faith and curiosity, while Fassbender’s David was the perfect blend of unsettling and fascinating—an android more human than the humans around him. And Theron? Her cold, corporate badassery added a delicious layer of tension.</p><p>But for all the things "Prometheus" got right, its flaws loomed as large as the Engineer statues. The whole "our DNA comes from a space giant dissolving in a river" premise felt half-baked at best, eye-roll-inducing at worst. If the Engineers were supposed to be our creators, why was there zero effort to explain their motives? Why did they want to wipe out humanity? What was this planet even for? Instead of storytelling, we got vague hints and unanswered questions wrapped in pseudo-philosophical musings.</p><p>Then there was the crew—easily the dumbest collection of scientists and astronauts ever put on screen. Removing helmets in an alien environment? Playing "here, kitty kitty" with a clearly hostile alien snake thing? These people made the space truckers from Alien look like Nobel Prize winners. And the mutations—ugh. Fifield’s transformation into a rabid space zombie was laughably bad, and don’t even get me started on the grotesque, beige "proto-Alien" at the end. It looked like a half-melted action figure.</p><p>Oh, and that rolling Engineer ship? The fact that Vickers—who had been competent up until that moment—somehow forgot to run sideways and got pancaked was the cherry on top of this frustrating mess.</p><p>"Prometheus" was a film of incredible potential, weighed down by weak storytelling and infuriatingly dumb character decisions. It gave us glimpses of something greater but never had the courage to actually show us anything meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p>Visually breathtaking, thematically ambitious, but ultimately… a beautifully designed pile of nonsense.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Alien: Covenant: A Gore-Soaked, Half-Baked Hybrid</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/s1296/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/w400-h225/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>If <b>Prometheus </b>was Ridley Scott\'s attempt at deep, existential sci-fi, <b>Alien: Covenant</b> was his half-hearted apology to fans who just wanted some classic Xenomorph carnage. And to be fair, it sort of delivered. We got facehuggers, chestbursters, and plenty of gruesome deaths. But at what cost? The film felt like it was straddling two worlds—trying to bridge the philosophical musings of Prometheus with the horror elements of Alien—and it never really nailed either.</p><p></p><p>Let’s start with the good. Visually, Covenant was just as slick as its predecessor, with some beautifully haunting cinematography. The ship design was solid, the eerie desolation of the Engineer city was striking, and the alien-infested sequences had some intense, gory payoff. And, once again, Michael Fassbender absolutely crushed it—his dual role as the psychotic David and the more naive Walter was easily the most compelling part of the movie. The flute scene? Weird, but Fassbender made it work. "I\'ll do the fingering" may have been unintentionally hilarious, but it also cemented David as one of the most fascinatingly twisted characters in the franchise.</p><p>But then we get to the problems—and, oh boy, there are many.&nbsp;</p><p>The crew? Somehow even dumber than the ones in Prometheus. These were colonists tasked with establishing a new human home, yet they made every idiotic decision possible. Landing on an uncharted planet without hazmat suits? Poking at alien life forms again? Splitting up the team when they know there’s a hostile presence? It was like watching a slasher movie where the victims are actively trying to get themselves killed.</p><p>The Xenomorphs? They felt… off. The Neomorphs were creepy, but they never really lived up to the terror of the original creatures. And when we finally got to a full-fledged Xenomorph, the CGI just didn\'t have the same weight or presence as the practical effects from Alien and Aliens. Instead of lurking in the shadows, dripping menace, the creature just kind of… sprinted around like a hyperactive dog.</p><p>And then there was that twist. We all saw it coming a mile away—David taking Walter’s place—yet the movie played it like some grand revelation. The final scene, with Daniels realizing the truth as David smugly locked her into cryosleep, had so much potential to be chilling. But it was frustrating because it was just another rehash of the same “crew doomed by their own stupidity” trope we’d already seen before.</p><p><b>Alien: Covenant</b> had all the ingredients of a great sci-fi horror film, but it never fully committed to either its horror roots or its philosophical ambitions. It wanted to be both a blood-soaked monster movie and a deep meditation on creation and destruction, but instead, it ended up being a half-baked mash-up that pleased neither camp.&nbsp;</p><p>It was more entertaining than Prometheus, sure, but it was also proof that Ridley Scott had no clear idea where he was taking this franchise.</p><p>But don\'t take my word for it, here\'s a detailed analysis of the franchise\'s decline by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Hollywood_Lore" target="_blank">Hollywood Lore</a>.</p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">So, there might still be some hope...</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Cautiously Optimistic About Alien: Romulus</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidtRyYz6hMg7b_QNx5GcMacBuC66Pja9OW8Gpx_BVcF_EXerphaUU2fuCG09Tmwon4j7eUTNHdz1Z-bf1C5xtaY2kbD5PEbZaKcw_EjHipyyeMr2LgUJrLbg4YXg9RfdrRvYGU68IiJsFho2TymSc0_S5zIXuqjERXopv2X5qA5w3zLmWZpvmvaA/s1288/BRNM7LTMLVED5O7ZYI5CNIX6LI.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidtRyYz6hMg7b_QNx5GcMacBuC66Pja9OW8Gpx_BVcF_EXerphaUU2fuCG09Tmwon4j7eUTNHdz1Z-bf1C5xtaY2kbD5PEbZaKcw_EjHipyyeMr2LgUJrLbg4YXg9RfdrRvYGU68IiJsFho2TymSc0_S5zIXuqjERXopv2X5qA5w3zLmWZpvmvaA/w400-h225/BRNM7LTMLVED5O7ZYI5CNIX6LI.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>So, after the Prometheus-Covenant debacle, should we dare to hope again? Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair. The film is set between Alien and Aliens, with a new cast, a new setting, and—hopefully—a return to the franchise’s roots.</p><p></p><p>Now, full disclosure: I haven’t seen it yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But from what I’ve gathered, early reviews suggest that Álvarez might actually get it. Critics have praised the film for leaning into the claustrophobic horror that made the original Alien so iconic. The visuals are supposedly striking, the tension palpable, and Cailee Spaeny’s performance as the lead, Rain, has been getting solid buzz. If Álvarez managed to capture that creeping dread of the original—without bogging it down in over-explained mythology—then we might just have a winner.</p><p>That said, not all reviews are glowing. Some critics feel the film leans too hard on nostalgia, offering little that’s truly new to the franchise. Others have called out a controversial digital recreation of Ian Holm’s Ash, arguing that it adds more distraction than depth. And there’s always the risk that Romulus ends up feeling like a well-shot rehash rather than a true evolution of the saga.</p><p>So, am I hopeful?&nbsp;</p><p>Cautiously, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like <b>Alien: Romulus</b> might finally be the course correction we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p><p>But I won’t know for sure until I see it myself.&nbsp;</p><p>And when I do, you can bet I’ll be back with my thoughts.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-alien-or-how.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-alien-or-how.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/s72-w640-h360-c/Alien(1979).png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment. Here’s a summary of all six options to help you decide:</p><ul><li><strong>Craftsman:</strong> Increases natural resources by 25%, providing an edge in resource-heavy builds or for cities situated in resource-poor areas.</li><li><strong>Strategist:</strong> Reduces the likelihood of incidents like fires by 20%, keeping your city safe from disasters that can disrupt growth.</li><li><strong>Trader:</strong> Generates passive income from trade routes, a reliable choice if you plan on focusing on a strong economy.</li><li><strong>Politician:</strong> Allows two additional decrees to be issued at a lower cost, giving you more control over civic policies and faster access to certain upgrades.</li><li><strong>Philosopher:</strong> Boosts cultural satisfaction by 15%, making it easier to attract and retain a happy, thriving population.</li><li><strong>Priest:</strong> Citizens make regular offerings of random resources, adding a steady flow of materials that can supplement your supply chain.</li></ul><p>Each path offers distinct benefits depending on your playstyle. For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city. Here’s how to create a well-rounded cultural hub:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Add the ceramic workshop to a district close to residential zones, maximizing its impact on citizen satisfaction.</li><li>Balance satisfaction areas carefully: Focus on health and creativity early on to keep citizens productive and happy.</li><li>Use decorative statues within districts. Strategically placed statues improve attraction and encourage population growth.</li><li>Expand the radius of cultural buildings. When feasible, prioritize cultural buildings that have a broader impact radius to maximize their effectiveness.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">5. Developing Infrastructure: Production and Trade Routes</h2><p>Setting up trade routes is essential for generating income and balancing resources as your city expands. In the playthrough, the author wisely establishes trade routes to sell excess stone and sand for gold, which funds additional buildings and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>\' trade and production systems:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure to unlock and build both the Horreum, a large storehouse, as well as the Macellum, a large market which will open up Trade Routes. Without these two buildings trade will not be possible.</li><li>Identify surplus resources. Selling excess materials like stone and sand brings in steady gold income, which can be used to fund essential upgrades.</li><li>Upgrade production buildings. Increasing output from woodcutting camps and quarries helps meet the growing demand for building materials.</li><li>Create a balanced workforce. Avoid overspecializing in one resource, which could create shortages elsewhere in your economy.</li><li>Invest in a larger marketplace. Upgrading the marketplace opens up more trade routes, offering new opportunities to exchange goods and expand your economy.</li><li>Manage trade efficiently. Check each route’s profitability and ensure you’re getting maximum value from each transaction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">6. Advanced Growth: Reaching the Tier 2 City</h2><p>As your city grows, upgrading to a Tier 2 city brings new buildings and capabilities, allowing for even greater development. However, this stage also introduces new challenges, such as managing faction tensions. Here are a few ways to make the transition smoothly:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Construct safety-focused buildings. Building structures like arenas can help reduce incidents, which become more likely as factions develop tensions.</li><li>Invest in cultural influence points. Advancing through the ages improves your city’s reputation and allows for higher-level upgrades.</li><li>Manage faction relations. Keep an eye on faction satisfaction levels and address issues before they escalate into conflicts. Certain factions may have different needs or preferences.</li><li>Create additional districts. As new buildings become available, expand your residential and industrial districts to accommodate a growing population.</li><li>Save resources for key upgrades. Some Tier 2 buildings are expensive, so stockpile resources like wood, stone, and gold to avoid delays in construction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">7. Unlocking Wonders and Advanced Cultural Buildings</h2><p>Once you’ve secured your city’s basics, investing in wonders and advanced cultural buildings provides significant boosts. In the video, the author demonstrates how to build high-value structures like the arena and the Agoge Center to enhance influence. Here’s a guide to prioritize wonders effectively:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Focus on the Agoge Center&nbsp;or library to boost cultural influence. These buildings improve city-wide satisfaction and increase your cultural reach.</li><li>Place wonders in high-traffic areas to maximize their impact. Wonders near residential zones offer bonuses to more citizens.</li><li>Consider safety upgrades for wonder districts. Building defensive structures near wonders ensures they’re protected from incidents.</li><li>Save resources for construction. Wonders often require substantial materials, so plan to accumulate what you need before starting.</li><li>Regularly expand surveyor cabins. This allows you to build wonders farther out from the core, increasing your city’s total area.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8. Optimizing Faction Management and Decrees</h2><p>At this stage, you’ll encounter factions with unique demands. Managing these factions carefully, especially if they develop tensions, will become an important of your city management. Use decrees and policies to mitigate conflicts and enhance your city’s stability.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Issue decrees strategically. Certain decrees, such as increased food production, improve citizen satisfaction or reduce faction tensions.</li><li>Manage faction trust levels. High trust prevents conflicts, while low trust increases the likelihood of incidents and disputes.</li><li>Consider faction removal if tensions rise too high. Sometimes, expelling a problematic faction is more beneficial than dealing with constant conflicts.</li><li>Create buffers between rival factions. Placing neutral buildings or parks between contentious factions can reduce interactions and potential conflicts.</li><li>Balance decrees for all factions. Ensure that no single faction feels neglected, as this can quickly lead to dissatisfaction.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2><p>Building a successful city in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;requires a careful blend of resource management, cultural development, and strategic planning.

Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city. Here’s how to create a well-rounded cultural hub:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Add the ceramic workshop to a district close to residential zones, maximizing its impact on citizen satisfaction.</li><li>Balance satisfaction areas carefully: Focus on health and creativity early on to keep citizens productive and happy.</li><li>Use decorative statues within districts. Strategically placed statues improve attraction and encourage population growth.</li><li>Expand the radius of cultural buildings. When feasible, prioritize cultural buildings that have a broader impact radius to maximize their effectiveness.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">5. Developing Infrastructure: Production and Trade Routes</h2><p>Setting up trade routes is essential for generating income and balancing resources as your city expands. In the playthrough, the author wisely establishes trade routes to sell excess stone and sand for gold, which funds additional buildings and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>\' trade and production systems:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure to unlock and build both the Horreum, a large storehouse, as well as the Macellum, a large market which will open up Trade Routes. Without these two buildings trade will not be possible.</li><li>Identify surplus resources. Selling excess materials like stone and sand brings in steady gold income, which can be used to fund essential upgrades.</li><li>Upgrade production buildings. Increasing output from woodcutting camps and quarries helps meet the growing demand for building materials.</li><li>Create a balanced workforce. Avoid overspecializing in one resource, which could create shortages elsewhere in your economy.</li><li>Invest in a larger marketplace. Upgrading the marketplace opens up more trade routes, offering new opportunities to exchange goods and expand your economy.</li><li>Manage trade efficiently. Check each route’s profitability and ensure you’re getting maximum value from each transaction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">6. Advanced Growth: Reaching the Tier 2 City</h2><p>As your city grows, upgrading to a Tier 2 city brings new buildings and capabilities, allowing for even greater development. However, this stage also introduces new challenges, such as managing faction tensions. Here are a few ways to make the transition smoothly:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Construct safety-focused buildings. Building structures like arenas can help reduce incidents, which become more likely as factions develop tensions.</li><li>Invest in cultural influence points. Advancing through the ages improves your city’s reputation and allows for higher-level upgrades.</li><li>Manage faction relations. Keep an eye on faction satisfaction levels and address issues before they escalate into conflicts. Certain factions may have different needs or preferences.</li><li>Create additional districts. As new buildings become available, expand your residential and industrial districts to accommodate a growing population.</li><li>Save resources for key upgrades. Some Tier 2 buildings are expensive, so stockpile resources like wood, stone, and gold to avoid delays in construction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">7. Unlocking Wonders and Advanced Cultural Buildings</h2><p>Once you’ve secured your city’s basics, investing in wonders and advanced cultural buildings provides significant boosts. In the video, the author demonstrates how to build high-value structures like the arena and the Agoge Center to enhance influence. Here’s a guide to prioritize wonders effectively:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Focus on the Agoge Center&nbsp;or library to boost cultural influence. These buildings improve city-wide satisfaction and increase your cultural reach.</li><li>Place wonders in high-traffic areas to maximize their impact. Wonders near residential zones offer bonuses to more citizens.</li><li>Consider safety upgrades for wonder districts. Building defensive structures near wonders ensures they’re protected from incidents.</li><li>Save resources for construction. Wonders often require substantial materials, so plan to accumulate what you need before starting.</li><li>Regularly expand surveyor cabins. This allows you to build wonders farther out from the core, increasing your city’s total area.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8. Optimizing Faction Management and Decrees</h2><p>At this stage, you’ll encounter factions with unique demands. Managing these factions carefully, especially if they develop tensions, will become an important of your city management. Use decrees and policies to mitigate conflicts and enhance your city’s stability.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Issue decrees strategically. Certain decrees, such as increased food production, improve citizen satisfaction or reduce faction tensions.</li><li>Manage faction trust levels. High trust prevents conflicts, while low trust increases the likelihood of incidents and disputes.</li><li>Consider faction removal if tensions rise too high. Sometimes, expelling a problematic faction is more beneficial than dealing with constant conflicts.</li><li>Create buffers between rival factions. Placing neutral buildings or parks between contentious factions can reduce interactions and potential conflicts.</li><li>Balance decrees for all factions. Ensure that no single faction feels neglected, as this can quickly lead to dissatisfaction.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2><p>Building a successful city in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;requires a careful blend of resource management, cultural development, and strategic planning. The full playthrough showcased each stage’s intricacies, from early resource gathering to managing complex faction relations and wonders.</p><p>&nbsp;Following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheOnlyL0nzY" target="_blank">TheOnlyL0nz</a>’s guidance, you can start your own city with the foundation necessary for growth and prosperity.</p><p>If you found this guide, I highly recommend you check out the author’s channel for even more gameplay insights and tutorials.

Between work (or trying to find my next role), family, and the general madness of daily life (soccer practices and games, lifts to here and there, the dog, etc.), finding the time to sit down and really immerse yourself in a game can feel like a luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s where city-building games come in, and let me tell you, they\'ve been a game-changer (pun totally intended).</p><span></span><h3 style="text-align: left;">The Magic of the Pause Button</h3><p>First off, let’s talk about one of the biggest perks of city-building games: the ability to pause or stop the game whenever you need to. Whether you\'re deep into a session of Cities: Skylines meticulously planning the perfect road network or trying to ensure your colonists survive another day in Surviving Mars, you can hit pause and step away without missing a beat. No need to worry about respawning in an FPS firefight or letting your team down in the middle of a MOBA match (I could write a whole posts on all the insults I\'ve taken from World of Tanks players).&nbsp;</p><p>These game wait for you, not the other way around.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Meditative Moments in Gaming</h3><p>Additionally, city-building games offer something incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world: a sense of peace and mindfulness. There’s a certain meditative quality to watching your city grow, whether it\'s a bustling metropolis in Cities: Skylines or a fragile colony on the brink of collapse in Frostpunk. You’re not just reacting to what’s happening on screen; you’re crafting something from the ground up, watching your creation evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s like a digital Zen garden, where each decision is a small stone you’re placing just so, bringing order to the chaos. Oh the hundreds of hours I\'ve spent in my Cities Skylines cities, beautifying them with parks, trees and endless landscaping.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Building Something That Lasts (well, sorta)</h3><p>Speaking of crafting, there’s something deeply satisfying about the “building something” aspect of these games. Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge. It’s not about speed or reflexes; it’s about foresight, planning, and adaptability.

Between work (or trying to find my next role), family, and the general madness of daily life (soccer practices and games, lifts to here and there, the dog, etc.), finding the time to sit down and really immerse yourself in a game can feel like a luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s where city-building games come in, and let me tell you, they\'ve been a game-changer (pun totally intended).</p><span></span><h3 style="text-align: left;">The Magic of the Pause Button</h3><p>First off, let’s talk about one of the biggest perks of city-building games: the ability to pause or stop the game whenever you need to. Whether you\'re deep into a session of Cities: Skylines meticulously planning the perfect road network or trying to ensure your colonists survive another day in Surviving Mars, you can hit pause and step away without missing a beat. No need to worry about respawning in an FPS firefight or letting your team down in the middle of a MOBA match (I could write a whole posts on all the insults I\'ve taken from World of Tanks players).&nbsp;</p><p>These game wait for you, not the other way around.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Meditative Moments in Gaming</h3><p>Additionally, city-building games offer something incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world: a sense of peace and mindfulness. There’s a certain meditative quality to watching your city grow, whether it\'s a bustling metropolis in Cities: Skylines or a fragile colony on the brink of collapse in Frostpunk. You’re not just reacting to what’s happening on screen; you’re crafting something from the ground up, watching your creation evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s like a digital Zen garden, where each decision is a small stone you’re placing just so, bringing order to the chaos. Oh the hundreds of hours I\'ve spent in my Cities Skylines cities, beautifying them with parks, trees and endless landscaping.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Building Something That Lasts (well, sorta)</h3><p>Speaking of crafting, there’s something deeply satisfying about the “building something” aspect of these games. Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge. It’s not about speed or reflexes; it’s about foresight, planning, and adaptability. In Frostpunk, for example, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death for your citizens, adding a layer of moral complexity to the game. It’s a challenge that’s less about adrenaline and more about thoughtful consideration—a welcome break from the usual high-octane fare.</p><p>City-building games like Cities: Skylines, Farthest Frontier, Per Aspera, Frostpunk, and Surviving Mars offer a unique blend of strategy, relaxation, and creativity that’s perfect for casual gamers, especially gamer dads.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re games you can pick up and put down at your convenience, offering a sense of accomplishment without the stress.

It\'s a version that many fans, including myself, would have loved to see brought to life on the big screen. While we\'ll never know for sure how Trevorrow\'s vision would have translated, it certainly offers a compelling alternative that feels truer to the legacy of Star Wars.&nbsp;</p><p>So, here\'s to the story that could have been, and to the endless possibilities of the galaxy far, far away.</p><p>Cause as it\'s stand today, Star Wars is in a shit load of trouble.

Someone with extensive experience piloting TDs would likely tell you that the following are the best setups, crew skills, and playstyle strategies to help your team secure victory.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Vehicle Setup in Detail</h3><h4 style="text-align: left;">Equipment Choices</h4><p>For both the Hellcat and Super Hellcat, the goal is to maximize their strengths: mobility, concealment, and firepower.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Optics (Binocular Telescope or Coated Optics)</b>: Increasing your view range is critical. Spotting enemies before they spot you allows you to make informed decisions on when to shoot and when to relocate. The choice between Binocular Telescope and Coated Optics depends on your playstyle; Binoculars for more stationary play and Coated Optics for more active scouting and repositioning.</li><li><b>Gun Rammer</b>: Reducing your reload time significantly increases your Damage Per Minute (DPM), making you a bigger threat on the battlefield. Being able to shoot more frequently means you can exploit enemy tanks\' vulnerabilities more often.</li><li><b>Camo Net / Turbocharger</b>: The choice here is between enhancing your stealth with a Camo Net or boosting your mobility with a Turbocharger. The Hellcat, being slightly more geared towards ambush tactics, benefits greatly from a Camo Net. The Super Hellcat, with its enhanced mobility, can further capitalize on this with a Turbocharger, allowing for rapid repositioning and flanking maneuvers.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;">Crew Skills in Detail</h3><p>Developing your crew skills is crucial for maximizing the potential of your TDs.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Commander</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Sixth Sense</b> is non-negotiable for TDs. Knowing when you\'ve been spotted can save you from being quickly eliminated.</li><li><b>Recon</b> further boosts your view range, complementing your equipment choices.</li></ul><li><b>Gunner</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> makes you harder to detect, a key survival trait for a TD.</li><li><b>Snap Shot</b> improves your gun\'s accuracy during turret movements, allowing for more reliable shots after repositioning.</li></ul><li><b>Driver</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Smooth Ride</b> reduces the accuracy penalty when firing on the move, which can be beneficial in hit-and-run tactics.</li><li><b>Off-Road Driving</b> improves your mobility on various terrains, enhancing your ability to quickly get into position or escape danger.</li></ul><li><b>Loader</b>: If your TD has a dedicated loader,</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> further enhances your stealth.</li><li><b>Safe Stowage</b> increases the durability of your ammo rack, reducing the chance of being taken out by a single hit.</li></ul></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Super Hellcat | World of Tanks Best Replays</h2><div style="text-align: center;"></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Gameplay Tactics in Detail</h2><h4 style="text-align: left;">Early Game</h4><p>The initial phase of the match is about gathering intelligence and taking key positions without being overly aggressive.</p><p><b>Scout and Reposition</b>: Use your mobility to reach forward positions quickly. Your goal is to gather as much information as possible on enemy movements for your team. After spotting, fall back to a safe distance before engaging.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Mid to Late Game</h4><p>As the match progresses, your role shifts towards exploiting enemy weaknesses and supporting your team from the second line.</p><p><b>Hit and Run</b>: Identify isolated targets or support teammates by targeting enemies focused on your allies. After firing, immediately relocate to avoid counter-fire, especially from enemy artillery or hidden TDs.</p><p><b>Supporting Heavies</b>: Position yourself behind or beside your team’s heavy tanks. From here, you can safely engage enemies that are distracted by your frontline, using your superior DPM to whittle them down.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Map Movement and Positioning</h3><p>Understanding each map\'s key features and sight lines is crucial. Use terrain to your advantage, keeping in mind that your primary goal is to support your team by dealing damage from concealed positions or by exploiting enemy flanks.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Use Terrain: Always be mindful of hills, ridges, and other terrain features that can provide cover or concealment. Being able to shoot without exposing your tank is a key skill for TD players.</li><li>Avoid Open Fields: Open areas are death zones for lightly armored vehicles like the Hellcat and Super Hellcat. Move from cover to cover and stay aware of potential threats like enemy TDs and artillery.</li><li>High Ground Advantage: High ground not only provides a better view of the battlefield but also makes it harder for enemies to hit your tank. Use elevation to your advantage whenever possible.</li></ul><p></p><p>By focusing on these strategies and continuously practicing and refining your skills, you\'ll greatly contribute to your team\'s efforts and enjoy success in your Hellcat and Super Hellcat in World of Tanks.</p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How a Super Hellcat should tag along with...</h2><div><span><div>The Hellcat, with its blend of mobility, firepower, and limited armor, can significantly benefit from coordinating with certain types of vehicles on the battlefield. Here’s a breakdown of which vehicles a Hellcat should consider partnering with and why:</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Medium Tanks</h3><div>Medium tanks are versatile and can perform a wide range of roles, making them excellent partners for the Hellcat. Their balance of speed, armor, and firepower allows them to effectively scout, flank, and engage enemies at various ranges. A Hellcat can support medium tanks by providing additional firepower from a second line or by exploiting openings created by the mediums’ aggressive maneuvers. This pairing can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions, moving to support weakened flanks or to capitalize on enemy vulnerabilities.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heavy Tanks</h3><div>While heavy tanks lack the Hellcat’s mobility, they make up for it with superior armor and firepower. Teaming up with heavy tanks allows the Hellcat to operate from behind the frontline, using the heavies as a shield while it delivers precise shots. This partnership is especially effective in areas with good cover and long sightlines, where the Hellcat can use its excellent gun to support the heavy tanks without exposing itself to enemy fire. The Hellcat should avoid blocking the retreat paths of allied heavy tanks and remain ready to reposition if the enemy breaks through the frontline.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Other TDs</h3><div>Pairing with other TDs, especially those with strong frontal armor, can create a formidable defensive line that can deter enemy advances. The Hellcat, with its good mobility, can act as a scout or flanker for this group, identifying targets for the more heavily armored TDs to engage. However, this requires good communication and coordination to ensure that the Hellcat does not become isolated or targeted by enemy artillery.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Artillery</h3><div>While not directly tagging along with artillery, a Hellcat can play a crucial role in protecting these valuable assets from enemy scouts and light tanks. By staying relatively close to friendly artillery, the Hellcat can use its mobility and firepower to intercept and eliminate threats to the team’s artillery pieces, ensuring they can continue to support the team effectively.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Light Tanks</h3><div>A somewhat less common but potentially effective partnership can be formed with light tanks. Light tanks excel in scouting and can quickly identify key enemy positions. A Hellcat following a light tank at a safe distance can capitalize on the scouting information, using its accurate gun to take out spotted enemies before they can react. However, this requires the Hellcat to stay alert and ready to move, as the light tank’s fast-paced scouting can lead them into rapidly changing situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>When pairing with any vehicle, the key for the Hellcat driver is to maintain situational awareness and adapt to the battle’s flow. The Hellcat\'s strength lies in its ability to deliver impactful damage from positions where it is not easily targeted. Effective communication with teammates and choosing the right moments to strike or relocate are crucial for leveraging the Hellcat’s capabilities to their fullest.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">How NOT to play the Super Hellcat!</h2></span></div><p style="text-align: left;">One of the worst ways to play the Hellcat in World of Tanks is to treat it like a frontline brawler or a heavy tank. The Hellcat is equipped with a powerful gun and excellent mobility but suffers from very thin armor and a relatively open turret design, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fire from almost all types of weapons it encounters on the battlefield.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Mistakes in Playing the Hellcat as a Frontline Tank:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Engaging in Direct Firefights: Attempting to trade shots with enemy tanks, especially heavies or well-armored mediums and TDs, is a quick way to get destroyed. The Hellcat\'s armor is insufficient to absorb hits, and its relatively large profile for a TD makes it an easy target when exposed.</li><li>Ignoring Cover and Concealment: Failing to use the terrain, bushes, and other forms of cover to hide your tank and mask your movements negates one of the Hellcat\'s main strengths – its ability to strike unseen. Being visible on the front lines means you\'ll likely be one of the first targets to be fired upon.</li><li>Static Gameplay: Staying in one position for too long, especially on the front lines, can make you an easy target for enemy artillery and tanks. The Hellcat thrives on its ability to relocate quickly, providing support where it\'s needed and avoiding return fire.</li><li>Not Using its Mobility: The Hellcat\'s speed is a key feature that allows it to flex across the map, responding to threats, reinforcing failing flanks, or exploiting gaps in the enemy lines. Playing it in a stationary, frontline role wastes this potential, making the tank much less effective than it could be.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Avoid These Mistakes:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Play to Your Strengths: Use the Hellcat\'s mobility and excellent gun handling to engage enemies from unexpected angles, relocate frequently to avoid being targeted, and always look for opportunities to support your team from a distance or the second line.</li><li>Stay Aware: Keep an eye on the mini-map and be ready to move if you\'re in danger of being flanked, or if there\'s a more advantageous position you can take to support your team.</li><li>Engage Wisely: Choose your battles carefully. Look for targets that are engaged with your teammates, isolated, or presenting their weaker armor to you. Avoid head-on engagements with tanks that can easily outgun or outarmor you.</li></ul><p></p><p>By avoiding the frontline brawler playstyle and focusing on mobility, stealth, and strategic engagement, you\'ll greatly increase your effectiveness and survivability in the Hellcat, turning it into a formidable asset for your team.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final thoughts...</h2><p>Mastering the Hellcat and Super Hellcat requires patience, good positioning, and an understanding of when to engage or retreat. Remember, your primary role is to support your team by providing accurate and timely damage from a distance or flanking. Avoid direct confrontations with heavier tanks unless you have a clear advantage or support. By following these strategies and adjusting your playstyle based on the battle\'s flow, you\'ll become a valuable asset to your team and help secure victory on the battlefield.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p>Jumping back into World of Tanks after long hiatus, and a big update felt a bit like a cold splash of water yesterday - especially when I dove straight into battle with my Super Hellcat and ended up more like a skittish kitten hiding in the bushes (literally) than the fierce TD I should\'ve been.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, my gameplay was rusty, and the match didn’t go well at all.

Your goal is to gather as much information as possible on enemy movements for your team. After spotting, fall back to a safe distance before engaging.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Mid to Late Game</h4><p>As the match progresses, your role shifts towards exploiting enemy weaknesses and supporting your team from the second line.</p><p><b>Hit and Run</b>: Identify isolated targets or support teammates by targeting enemies focused on your allies. After firing, immediately relocate to avoid counter-fire, especially from enemy artillery or hidden TDs.</p><p><b>Supporting Heavies</b>: Position yourself behind or beside your team’s heavy tanks. From here, you can safely engage enemies that are distracted by your frontline, using your superior DPM to whittle them down.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Map Movement and Positioning</h3><p>Understanding each map\'s key features and sight lines is crucial. Use terrain to your advantage, keeping in mind that your primary goal is to support your team by dealing damage from concealed positions or by exploiting enemy flanks.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Use Terrain: Always be mindful of hills, ridges, and other terrain features that can provide cover or concealment. Being able to shoot without exposing your tank is a key skill for TD players.</li><li>Avoid Open Fields: Open areas are death zones for lightly armored vehicles like the Hellcat and Super Hellcat. Move from cover to cover and stay aware of potential threats like enemy TDs and artillery.</li><li>High Ground Advantage: High ground not only provides a better view of the battlefield but also makes it harder for enemies to hit your tank. Use elevation to your advantage whenever possible.</li></ul><p></p><p>By focusing on these strategies and continuously practicing and refining your skills, you\'ll greatly contribute to your team\'s efforts and enjoy success in your Hellcat and Super Hellcat in World of Tanks.</p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How a Super Hellcat should tag along with...</h2><div><span><div>The Hellcat, with its blend of mobility, firepower, and limited armor, can significantly benefit from coordinating with certain types of vehicles on the battlefield. Here’s a breakdown of which vehicles a Hellcat should consider partnering with and why:</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Medium Tanks</h3><div>Medium tanks are versatile and can perform a wide range of roles, making them excellent partners for the Hellcat. Their balance of speed, armor, and firepower allows them to effectively scout, flank, and engage enemies at various ranges. A Hellcat can support medium tanks by providing additional firepower from a second line or by exploiting openings created by the mediums’ aggressive maneuvers. This pairing can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions, moving to support weakened flanks or to capitalize on enemy vulnerabilities.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heavy Tanks</h3><div>While heavy tanks lack the Hellcat’s mobility, they make up for it with superior armor and firepower. Teaming up with heavy tanks allows the Hellcat to operate from behind the frontline, using the heavies as a shield while it delivers precise shots. This partnership is especially effective in areas with good cover and long sightlines, where the Hellcat can use its excellent gun to support the heavy tanks without exposing itself to enemy fire. The Hellcat should avoid blocking the retreat paths of allied heavy tanks and remain ready to reposition if the enemy breaks through the frontline.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Other TDs</h3><div>Pairing with other TDs, especially those with strong frontal armor, can create a formidable defensive line that can deter enemy advances. The Hellcat, with its good mobility, can act as a scout or flanker for this group, identifying targets for the more heavily armored TDs to engage. However, this requires good communication and coordination to ensure that the Hellcat does not become isolated or targeted by enemy artillery.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Artillery</h3><div>While not directly tagging along with artillery, a Hellcat can play a crucial role in protecting these valuable assets from enemy scouts and light tanks. By staying relatively close to friendly artillery, the Hellcat can use its mobility and firepower to intercept and eliminate threats to the team’s artillery pieces, ensuring they can continue to support the team effectively.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Light Tanks</h3><div>A somewhat less common but potentially effective partnership can be formed with light tanks. Light tanks excel in scouting and can quickly identify key enemy positions. A Hellcat following a light tank at a safe distance can capitalize on the scouting information, using its accurate gun to take out spotted enemies before they can react. However, this requires the Hellcat to stay alert and ready to move, as the light tank’s fast-paced scouting can lead them into rapidly changing situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>When pairing with any vehicle, the key for the Hellcat driver is to maintain situational awareness and adapt to the battle’s flow. The Hellcat\'s strength lies in its ability to deliver impactful damage from positions where it is not easily targeted. Effective communication with teammates and choosing the right moments to strike or relocate are crucial for leveraging the Hellcat’s capabilities to their fullest.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">How NOT to play the Super Hellcat!</h2></span></div><p style="text-align: left;">One of the worst ways to play the Hellcat in World of Tanks is to treat it like a frontline brawler or a heavy tank. The Hellcat is equipped with a powerful gun and excellent mobility but suffers from very thin armor and a relatively open turret design, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fire from almost all types of weapons it encounters on the battlefield.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Mistakes in Playing the Hellcat as a Frontline Tank:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Engaging in Direct Firefights: Attempting to trade shots with enemy tanks, especially heavies or well-armored mediums and TDs, is a quick way to get destroyed. The Hellcat\'s armor is insufficient to absorb hits, and its relatively large profile for a TD makes it an easy target when exposed.</li><li>Ignoring Cover and Concealment: Failing to use the terrain, bushes, and other forms of cover to hide your tank and mask your movements negates one of the Hellcat\'s main strengths – its ability to strike unseen. Being visible on the front lines means you\'ll likely be one of the first targets to be fired upon.</li><li>Static Gameplay: Staying in one position for too long, especially on the front lines, can make you an easy target for enemy artillery and tanks. The Hellcat thrives on its ability to relocate quickly, providing support where it\'s needed and avoiding return fire.</li><li>Not Using its Mobility: The Hellcat\'s speed is a key feature that allows it to flex across the map, responding to threats, reinforcing failing flanks, or exploiting gaps in the enemy lines. Playing it in a stationary, frontline role wastes this potential, making the tank much less effective than it could be.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Avoid These Mistakes:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Play to Your Strengths: Use the Hellcat\'s mobility and excellent gun handling to engage enemies from unexpected angles, relocate frequently to avoid being targeted, and always look for opportunities to support your team from a distance or the second line.</li><li>Stay Aware: Keep an eye on the mini-map and be ready to move if you\'re in danger of being flanked, or if there\'s a more advantageous position you can take to support your team.</li><li>Engage Wisely: Choose your battles carefully. Look for targets that are engaged with your teammates, isolated, or presenting their weaker armor to you. Avoid head-on engagements with tanks that can easily outgun or outarmor you.</li></ul><p></p><p>By avoiding the frontline brawler playstyle and focusing on mobility, stealth, and strategic engagement, you\'ll greatly increase your effectiveness and survivability in the Hellcat, turning it into a formidable asset for your team.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final thoughts...</h2><p>Mastering the Hellcat and Super Hellcat requires patience, good positioning, and an understanding of when to engage or retreat. Remember, your primary role is to support your team by providing accurate and timely damage from a distance or flanking. Avoid direct confrontations with heavier tanks unless you have a clear advantage or support. By following these strategies and adjusting your playstyle based on the battle\'s flow, you\'ll become a valuable asset to your team and help secure victory on the battlefield.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/03/hellcat-chronicles-turning-casual-play.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/03/hellcat-chronicles-turning-casual-play.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://img.youtube.com/vi/bCXLko6NS6M/default.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

Gibson’s narrative continuity with "Aliens" could have offered fans a more satisfying narrative bridge between the second and fourth films of the franchise. Additionally, the screenplay\'s exploration of themes such as cold war tensions and the dangers of bioweaponry could have added depth to the "Alien" universe, presenting a nuanced backdrop against which the horror and survival elements of the series could unfold.</p><p>[SPOILER ALERT below]</p><p>Moreover, Gibson’s screenplay proposed a fresh take on the Xenomorph life cycle and the potential for human-Xenomorph hybrids, introducing new elements to the alien mythology that could have enriched the franchise\'s lore.

Unlike Fincher\'s version, Gibson\'s screenplay maintains the survival and continuity of key characters from "Aliens," notably Bishop, Newt and Hicks, and introduces a plot revolving around the militarization and genetic modification of Xenomorphs.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWsBkzttURXTM1YjDs0878gaasZRM5R6TSbK9szWvsuLE4X2Z5wU7sWA6gjVSq-UmufTH4dxHenNxonaST3K_JEjWKkxqU4UL-737UjQ_sFbdUtmMzKYfFyQRQLrDaQjQHBVF_OT171d8jce9-Cvl8k0PnE17srQAFCFogHvgyuZp_RMvG1J-vuQ/s1000/Alien3BookCover.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="215" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWsBkzttURXTM1YjDs0878gaasZRM5R6TSbK9szWvsuLE4X2Z5wU7sWA6gjVSq-UmufTH4dxHenNxonaST3K_JEjWKkxqU4UL-737UjQ_sFbdUtmMzKYfFyQRQLrDaQjQHBVF_OT171d8jce9-Cvl8k0PnE17srQAFCFogHvgyuZp_RMvG1J-vuQ/w141-h215/Alien3BookCover.jpg" width="141" /></a></div><p></p><p>One of the key aspects where Gibson\'s screenplay could have excelled over Fincher\'s "Alien 3" is in its extension of the action-oriented, ensemble-cast dynamics that James Cameron developed in "Aliens." Gibson’s narrative continuity with "Aliens" could have offered fans a more satisfying narrative bridge between the second and fourth films of the franchise. Additionally, the screenplay\'s exploration of themes such as cold war tensions and the dangers of bioweaponry could have added depth to the "Alien" universe, presenting a nuanced backdrop against which the horror and survival elements of the series could unfold.</p><p>[SPOILER ALERT below]</p><p>Moreover, Gibson’s screenplay proposed a fresh take on the Xenomorph life cycle and the potential for human-Xenomorph hybrids, introducing new elements to the alien mythology that could have enriched the franchise\'s lore.
