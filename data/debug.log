This chemo does some really wild stuff to me mentally.  After the fourth dose, I wrote this note down when I was in the throes of it, <i>"There\'s a weird side effect to this chemo -- it\'s like having a quasi-hallucination, but more like a kind of a vivid, strange imagination. Just now I was able to clearly picture a girl with fiercely intense blue eyes that looked almost bird like. It\'s like a vividness to my dreams while I\'m awake (or half awake). There\'s a tingle to the world as you sit here slowly dying. Shutting down. Not caring. Hard to explain. Listlessness. That\'s what this chemo does to you."</i></span><br /><br /><span>Now that I\'m on immunotherapy only, it feels super easy in comparison. Sure, I was a little tired right afterwards, and my arms and scalp are dry and itchy, but that\'s nothing in comparison to how dark life got on days three-through-six after a carboplatin and pemetrexed infusion. </span><br /><br /><span>Apparently if my next CT scan shows even MORE improvement, then they might even consider moving me to a "stable disease" status, which is where they would cut down the amount of office visits and scans. I have to say that feels very weird, and I\'m not sure I like it. While the doctor would be happy with "stable," I want "cured." I guess when you have Stage 4 cancer, you get what you get and just be happy you\'re not dead, dummy. </span><br /><br /><span>I\'m hoping I\'m lucky and immunotherapy doesn\'t turn on me, and it does the trick. As ChatGPT put it to me, chemo was running a bulldozer through my body, and now immunotherapy is like putting the guard dogs out to attack cancer. </span><br /><br /><span>Everyone please keep sending those vibes my way. I don\'t care if they\'re prayers, meditations, or even spoken to the universe in your goofiest Count Chocula voice. You send it -- I\'ll take it.

It\'s a forced vacation. The biggest problem with that is that I\'m a stupid cancer patient as well. If a CT scan comes up on a random day of the week when we all go back to work, I can\'t just, uh, not go because I don\'t have the PTO hours. </span><br /><br /><span>By the end of this all, things will be tight for a bit unless I can get some more gifted PTO.

She\'s pretty cool. I like what she did with the song structure to change it from my xylophone and muted distant trumpets thing to a folksy blues song.</span><br /><br /><span>. . . also playing a lot of Dune Awakening with Dylan.

Keep it coming! This is a long fight. The third biopsy yielded genetic results that were, as my doctor called them, rare and interesting. He didn\'t know what to make of them since typically most lung cancers have some relatively well-known mutation like ALK. Nope, mine manifested something called FANCG (𝑐.1642𝐶&gt;𝑇, 𝑝.𝑅548*) – 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑐 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 1–2, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐) and RET (𝑐.1063+11𝑑𝑒𝑙𝐶) – 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑈𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 3, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐). While ChatGPT gave me some mixed hope with FANCG, my doc let me know that it\'s nothing that could really be actionable. RET, well, this mutation was more like . . . well . . . not much research has been done with it, so, good luck?</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: My doctor felt like I was still a good candidate for Immunotherapy and specifically a lung cancer trial turned lung cancer treatment called Checkmate 9LA (it was approved for use about 5 years ago or so). This will wrap in the immunotherapies known as ipilimumab and nivolumab alongside chemo. If it works, it has double the chance of sending my cancer into remission as my chemo did.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI=w360-h640" width="360" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>"HERE\'S TOMMY!"</i></div></i><p></p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I\'m legitimately terrified of moving on by adding immunotherapy to my chemotherapy regimen.

Keep it coming! This is a long fight. The third biopsy yielded genetic results that were, as my doctor called them, rare and interesting. He didn\'t know what to make of them since typically most lung cancers have some relatively well-known mutation like ALK. Nope, mine manifested something called FANCG (𝑐.1642𝐶&gt;𝑇, 𝑝.𝑅548*) – 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑐 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 1–2, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐) and RET (𝑐.1063+11𝑑𝑒𝑙𝐶) – 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑈𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑇𝑖𝑒𝑟 3, 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐). While ChatGPT gave me some mixed hope with FANCG, my doc let me know that it\'s nothing that could really be actionable. RET, well, this mutation was more like . . . well . . . not much research has been done with it, so, good luck?</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: My doctor felt like I was still a good candidate for Immunotherapy and specifically a lung cancer trial turned lung cancer treatment called Checkmate 9LA (it was approved for use about 5 years ago or so). This will wrap in the immunotherapies known as ipilimumab and nivolumab alongside chemo. If it works, it has double the chance of sending my cancer into remission as my chemo did.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiX6-J-5qbQthELBnKwLP4qfM-73_oKGHFvC3TMiY8MmhIKsnfdcihibYCS9LQUkTwuk2OXBsKy5OenqEN-ohZUeQjkdZz5uleMKuZ17_OYI39M_CsNOg_CCxbx01mfyNz8ovC0xLLEeVVXnUhptf45yMElEeuqCAApPRoIaxIR7hIt6TQrNGEp7pGw5BI=w360-h640" width="360" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>"HERE\'S TOMMY!"</i></div></i><p></p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I\'m legitimately terrified of moving on by adding immunotherapy to my chemotherapy regimen. I read too much about it online, and I don\'t like the odds for developing an auto-immune disorder from this amazing cancer killing method. I guess it really comes down to a "would you rather" type of question: Would you rather have a chance of living the rest of your life with an auto-immune disorder or simply dying with cancer? I\'ll take being alive, please. Most people are fine, but you are rolling the dice. (is a hard +1 Constitution Saving throw for my D&amp;D friends)</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I just got back from an amazing lunch at Santorini\'s Greek Restaurant at Farmington Station. My good friend Colleen bought me lunch, but only after she and my other hard-working buddies, Mandy and Hannah, entertained me through 3 hours of infusion at the Huntsman Center there in Farmington. My friends are calling themselves "Team Tom" and I am truly humbled by the love, kindness, and example they\'ve shown me today. I have often said how lucky I am to have strong female role models -- my wife, my relatives, and good friends like these. So many kind and loving women in my life. Seriously! I feel blessed!

I forget how blessed I am, and I end up sighing to the rafters in my bedroom, cursing the cancer inside of me and how stupid it all feels. How dumb I feel for having cancer. How much inconvenience it causes. The pain of it all. How it feels to be worlds apart from my fat-and-happy-Tom-days in Texas. I had it so good for so many years, how did I end up with this stupid crap in my lungs and back in Utah? I sometimes make the joke that I\'m "Stage 4 at JT4" at my job here in Utah and I used to be "Fat and Happy Tom" in Texas . . . you know, just making, promoting, and playing games. THE LIFE! No, no . . . I am blessed. It\'s just hard to see it sometimes, and that\'s just one of my many failings. Thank you, role models!</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I was able to have some complimentary music therapy from the Huntsman Institute!&nbsp; My social worker turned me on to a really cool benefit (if you can say there\'s a silver lining to having lung cancer) where I can get 6 sessions of music therapy. I sat down with Indigo and an intern and basically talked about my entire music history. (by the way, if you\'re interested and have a half hour of time to read it, you\'re welcome to read more here: <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/08/music-history.html">https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/08/music-history.html</a>). I truly want to write an album of music called "Cosmic Radiation and Bad Luck," named after what my doctor said was the most likely cause of my cancer. I know two tracks that I want on it for sure. (I\'m in the process of adding to a Spotify inspiration song list for the general vibe I want to go for: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1JGD472Z10LK5Zi77A59IL">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1JGD472Z10LK5Zi77A59IL</a>)</p><p>𝐁𝐚𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I waste too much time playing video games to write music -- I should probably stop doing that, but man is <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening">Dune Awakening</a> fun to play lately! I also dropped $12 bucks on a humble bundle deal that supplied me with 16 games that I\'ve never played before. I\'m doomed. (Not to mention all the great shows I still need to watch on Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Apple+, Prime, and on and on) It\'s nice to have so many distractions. First world problems at its best.</p><p>𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: Speaking of video game distractions, I\'ve started reskinning my 1up machine to look like an honest to goodness Ghosts n\' Goblins machine!

COVID and a quarantined reality solidly hit everyone in 2020. I was staying home and with extra time on my hands. My buddy at work had a group named Bueno Sueno and they had just released a song called Lost in the Shine. I convinced him to send me the stems and flexed my remixing muscles with a mix I called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgtQu2zECs">Tom Purdue Shimmer Mix</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That remix set off a bug in me, and I started remixing or remaking some deep cut songs that were meaningful to me in one way or another. Before I knew it, I had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vWqp7YBZE&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHpgc58cpOgeOQY7F_nR3h9S">whole playlist of remixes and remakes on YouTube</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Cetu Javu\'s Fight Without a Reason (Lifestyle Remix)</li><li>Morrissey\'s Now My Heart is Full (Bunny Love Remix)</li><li>Cabaret Voltaire\'s Code (Wah Guitar Mix)</li><li>The Cure\'s Night Like This (Deeper Still Mix)</li><li>Decussion Council\'s (yes, my old high school band) Don\'t Stop (Everyone Hang On Mix)</li><li>Tom Purdue\'s Bit by Bit (2020 Mix)</li></ul><p></p><p>I wrote about all of them in&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2020/06/mixtape-fire-my-past-month-in-flames.html">this blog post from June 2020</a>. As mentioned in that blog post, I formulated a plan to release a lathe print vinyl record with a very small print run . . . 4-5 copies through a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://americanvinylco.com/product-category/one-off-and-short-run-vinyl-records/">American Vinyl</a>. When I got the records back, I thought they sounded horrible. I hadn\'t mixed the songs considering volume levels and how they would actually play on a record player. I threw them in the garbage can in disgust.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, who is much smarter than me, saved them out of the garbage can and instead stashed them in a secret spot that I would only find later when we were moving from Texas back to Utah. (which . . . is a story all unto itself.) Turns out it was mostly the fault of our bad record player at the time. There were a few sub-bass hits on the Don\'t Stop mix that were just too low and distorted a bit, but that\'s it. The record sounds great.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/s4000/20240406_195749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/w185-h400/20240406_195749.jpg" width="185" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Not the white album, it\'s a Quarantined Mix Record from Tom Purdue!</i></p><p>For real though, the life as a rock star wannabe had become nothing more than a dusty, distant 30-year-old memory up until 2021 when a great guy named Adam Terry contacted me over Instagram holding both my Darkest America and Freeze tapes from back in 1990.

With Adam\'s help, the hope of actually releasing some old music of mine on his label,&nbsp;<a href="https://fountainavm.com/">FountainAVM</a>, was now a possibility! He asked to hear more of my stuff and I flooded his Dropbox with hours upon hours of old music I had recorded on tape.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s1910/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s320/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" width="251" /></a></div><br /><p>Adam was fantastic! I\'ve never had anyone dump so many hours of their life just dedicated to listening to my music. Honestly, the real help from Adam has been feeling like someone actually cared about me as an artist enough to reach out and help me dust off the old tapes. While there may be a lot of sadness and regret from the past, his simple act of reaching out kind of unplugged so many things that I had bottled up over the years. That alone was appreciated.</p><p>From all that, Adam curated two albums of music.&nbsp; The first was just released last year. <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2024/03/an-ant-survives-rainstorm.html">As discussed in this post</a>:</p><p><i>"My new "old" album was released today by FOUNTAINavm.

MOST of them. A couple songs had been lost to time, and we just made do with the old recordings we had.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Adam curated an interesting selection that\'s different from my usual sound. I\'m happy with the result. I\'ve enjoyed riding around in my car late at night listening to An Ant Survives A Rainstorm and hope you would too.</i></p><p><i>Thanks to FOUNTAINavm for releasing this music and thanks for listening!"</i></p><p>While discussing old music with Adam, we also started discussing new music (well new music to me), and he turned me on to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6R1cNisR3xvk0ivHz13P6E">Minimalist Wave Tapes</a> project, so I started listening to it plus some old formative, meaningful music to me from the 70\'s - 90\'s like Kraftwerk, Boards of Canada, Yaz, Thompson Twins, and the Psychedelic Furs. After baptizing myself in all this music and having recently remade Bit by Bit for my Quarantined Mixes, I realized I could make a synthwave album of my own.</p><p>The end result was Red Pinto Hatchback, released in 2021. I actually made two posts about this one. One about the making of <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/09/red-pinto-hatchback-cover-art.html">the cover art</a>, and one <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/10/red-pinto-hatchback-launched.html">about the album release itself</a>. As I stated in that post:</p><p><i>". . . So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette.

It\'s a gritty industrial piece that features the synth work of David Kane. Back in 1988 I was watching 120 minutes on MTV when a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DiNYb20WY">Baby Doe Rules</a> by David Kane\'s Decay of the Western Civilization came on, and I recorded it on VHS tape. I asked every record shop I could find in Utah if they had it so I could listen to more, and no one knew what I was talking about.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Eventually I transferred the song off of VHS tape to audio tape so I could listen to it in my car. It was a rare track that no one knew.

COVID and a quarantined reality solidly hit everyone in 2020. I was staying home and with extra time on my hands. My buddy at work had a group named Bueno Sueno and they had just released a song called Lost in the Shine. I convinced him to send me the stems and flexed my remixing muscles with a mix I called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgtQu2zECs">Tom Purdue Shimmer Mix</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That remix set off a bug in me, and I started remixing or remaking some deep cut songs that were meaningful to me in one way or another. Before I knew it, I had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vWqp7YBZE&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHpgc58cpOgeOQY7F_nR3h9S">whole playlist of remixes and remakes on YouTube</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Cetu Javu\'s Fight Without a Reason (Lifestyle Remix)</li><li>Morrissey\'s Now My Heart is Full (Bunny Love Remix)</li><li>Cabaret Voltaire\'s Code (Wah Guitar Mix)</li><li>The Cure\'s Night Like This (Deeper Still Mix)</li><li>Decussion Council\'s (yes, my old high school band) Don\'t Stop (Everyone Hang On Mix)</li><li>Tom Purdue\'s Bit by Bit (2020 Mix)</li></ul><p></p><p>I wrote about all of them in&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2020/06/mixtape-fire-my-past-month-in-flames.html">this blog post from June 2020</a>. As mentioned in that blog post, I formulated a plan to release a lathe print vinyl record with a very small print run . . . 4-5 copies through a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://americanvinylco.com/product-category/one-off-and-short-run-vinyl-records/">American Vinyl</a>. When I got the records back, I thought they sounded horrible. I hadn\'t mixed the songs considering volume levels and how they would actually play on a record player. I threw them in the garbage can in disgust.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, who is much smarter than me, saved them out of the garbage can and instead stashed them in a secret spot that I would only find later when we were moving from Texas back to Utah. (which . . . is a story all unto itself.) Turns out it was mostly the fault of our bad record player at the time. There were a few sub-bass hits on the Don\'t Stop mix that were just too low and distorted a bit, but that\'s it. The record sounds great.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/s4000/20240406_195749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/w185-h400/20240406_195749.jpg" width="185" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Not the white album, it\'s a Quarantined Mix Record from Tom Purdue!</i></p><p>For real though, the life as a rock star wannabe had become nothing more than a dusty, distant 30-year-old memory up until 2021 when a great guy named Adam Terry contacted me over Instagram holding both my Darkest America and Freeze tapes from back in 1990.

With Adam\'s help, the hope of actually releasing some old music of mine on his label,&nbsp;<a href="https://fountainavm.com/">FountainAVM</a>, was now a possibility! He asked to hear more of my stuff and I flooded his Dropbox with hours upon hours of old music I had recorded on tape.</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s1910/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimy6agRcI_XMkanO1gAK7-VWYxdWeAqdr4EwAPo3zkkCdWJcywK7IELSU-GRFStnZ_eqnlJ42NtKrctvO8j60QO5_OqbMXmEFUgGc9VmUMIorZmy5mdQSD5XFRzXQuEIBHwJlyyudy1Fg/s320/fountain-avm-logo-trans-black-lrg.png" width="251" /></a></div><br /><p>Adam was fantastic! I\'ve never had anyone dump so many hours of their life just dedicated to listening to my music. Honestly, the real help from Adam has been feeling like someone actually cared about me as an artist enough to reach out and help me dust off the old tapes. While there may be a lot of sadness and regret from the past, his simple act of reaching out kind of unplugged so many things that I had bottled up over the years. That alone was appreciated.</p><p>From all that, Adam curated two albums of music.&nbsp; The first was just released last year. <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2024/03/an-ant-survives-rainstorm.html">As discussed in this post</a>:</p><p><i>"My new "old" album was released today by FOUNTAINavm.

I\'m happy with the result. I\'ve enjoyed riding around in my car late at night listening to An Ant Survives A Rainstorm and hope you would too.</i></p><p><i>Thanks to FOUNTAINavm for releasing this music and thanks for listening!"</i></p><p>While discussing old music with Adam, we also started discussing new music (well new music to me), and he turned me on to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6R1cNisR3xvk0ivHz13P6E">Minimalist Wave Tapes</a> project, so I started listening to it plus some old formative, meaningful music to me from the 70\'s - 90\'s like Kraftwerk, Boards of Canada, Yaz, Thompson Twins, and the Psychedelic Furs. After baptizing myself in all this music and having recently remade Bit by Bit for my Quarantined Mixes, I realized I could make a synthwave album of my own.</p><p>The end result was Red Pinto Hatchback, released in 2021. I actually made two posts about this one. One about the making of <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/09/red-pinto-hatchback-cover-art.html">the cover art</a>, and one <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/10/red-pinto-hatchback-launched.html">about the album release itself</a>. As I stated in that post:</p><p><i>". . . So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette.

I\'ve talked a bit about my wonderful distractions like Hogwarts Legacy and Dune, but really, they are just distractions from what\'s really going on with me. Unfortunately, it\'s because I have an actual health issue that\'s hard for me to talk about. I\'ve been putting it off because who wants to talk about cancer?! Ugh. Is there any good time to talk about cancer? probably not. Here we go.</p><p>About 4-5 months ago, I started having some pretty strong shoulder and back pain. At the time I thought I had done something to my shoulder while going <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/03/catching-up-with-friendly-march-2025.html">axe throwing with my church group</a>. What followed was a month of going to the chiropractor to no avail. After a couple trips to the regular doctor and two x-rays later, my doctor recommended I get a CT scan since I had some fluid on my lungs and things looked "worse."</p><p>After the CT scan review, the doctor let me know I had about five masses in my left lung, and one of them looked cancerous. We scheduled a PET scan and sure enough, my left lung lit up like a Christmas tree.</p><p>Next up typically would be a biopsy, but I managed to fast track a fluid drain from my lungs at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake, which verified, yes, this is non-small cell Adenocarcinoma in my lungs. Between that fluid analysis and my PET Scan, my oncology team let me know I\'ve been classified with Stage 4 Lung Cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>No one knows how I got it.

I\'m not sure what my decision did or did not do for me since surely I\'ll be playing Risi\'s journey as well, but they gave me an interesting choice.</span><br /><br /><span face="&quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web (West European)&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #242424; font-size: 14.6667px;">The "safe" designer in me wonders why you would ever detach someone from the main quest line, even for a moment.&nbsp; The "creative" designer in me loves the "surprise and delight" moment of even being offered a choice.&nbsp; You definitely don\'t see this same type of choice being offered in AW2 (as far as I remember correctly).&nbsp; Part of me wonders if the metrics showed them that people stopped playing at this area when they did that?&nbsp; It\'s something I\'d love to know just to answer my own curiosity.</span><br /><br /><span face="&quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web (West European)&quot;, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #242424; font-size: 14.6667px;">So far in Stikkan\'s follow-on quest, I\'ve unlocked a new wolf companion.&nbsp; He\'s a brutal dual wielder that can howl at magical ice crystals and break them so you can proceed. In this quest, I\'m finding myself swapping back and forth between companions a lot to solve puzzles and break through blocking mechanics. This feels really good in late game.

At the time, my job was to work closely with an outsourcing team in Spain to build a vertical slice of a mobile game called Unnatural Selection (UNS). The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk. When you do find something that works, you can go all in (as they did with our game <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2022/08/game-portfolio-rpg-dice-heroes-of.html">Dice RPG</a>).</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">When I got wind that we were transitioning to VR, I instantly wanted to try making our UNS mobile game as a VR game (UNSVR!). To that end, I drew up a PowerPoint pitch deck and presented it to our executives. They were interested and happy I had taken that initiative, but they wanted something a bit less risky and strange for our first VR project.&nbsp; I can\'t say I blame them!</span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">Below are a few of the slides from that PowerPoint deck:</span></p><p style="color: #222222; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/s1265/deck1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/w640-h356/deck1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/s1280/deck2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/w640-h358/deck2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/s1291/deck3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/w640-h360/deck3.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/s1920/deck5.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/w640-h360/deck5.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/s1296/deck4.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/w640-h360/deck4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Later, in 2023, WIMO hosted a game jam internally and encouraged all teams to make VR games. Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build. Below are a few slides from that Powerpoint.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXhGQaNHO29lWdW1yEdA2ppUMD5o13H1Llhw-2c67OzFsRenXcpI-oawqy_XROPxPky45IREz3Hlh_-M4Jwy4ArCSURfprZnUaYpmOFrNj2HDCG1Vq6cGRiQ6OX8vPCUN7L-J06d8DA0yZLY9WdRaYQ34hvj3bWKO1x63pUwlqwITjF4iw9oKbqiYl0tU/s1375/Screenshot%202025-04-09%20175546.png" style="margin-left: 1em;

At the time, my job was to work closely with an outsourcing team in Spain to build a vertical slice of a mobile game called Unnatural Selection (UNS). The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk. When you do find something that works, you can go all in (as they did with our game <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2022/08/game-portfolio-rpg-dice-heroes-of.html">Dice RPG</a>).</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">When I got wind that we were transitioning to VR, I instantly wanted to try making our UNS mobile game as a VR game (UNSVR!). To that end, I drew up a PowerPoint pitch deck and presented it to our executives. They were interested and happy I had taken that initiative, but they wanted something a bit less risky and strange for our first VR project.&nbsp; I can\'t say I blame them!</span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">Below are a few of the slides from that PowerPoint deck:</span></p><p style="color: #222222; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/s1265/deck1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPk9ol5ArvheghAiTS1XZ4xCj3GPwegsRyRiFKxNLTUvHvCMH20tXHlaM-FLBGZ4vVpCXpgzfQUuL_asq0tWLDfzobe817XG8x6njkJvy0CgVZSOJXdzM8tw11HNsE2GyprrqgXJNksm2QRnXw0eFhHobW_a_ixul_nIaPzkQjyn73Hx9UIh82yEjkpXU/w640-h356/deck1.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/s1280/deck2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGa6fCSKNU0RKIB_ML10nrgDT6Wnfn5ULapRZeYN4FU86CbigeUnAVtoHsCMAAoP-EFMf4mGb8fgqgSJXZNMib7oAonKIyQFbc6LewgVGKU2luL4vgFVjSafI6DUIQ9W0MIdqXcI4F_rm1yc_eusXgrSCJI9RTikgPuXVGWSGoTiFkhfPj09qZqr4VYh8/w640-h358/deck2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />\u200b<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/s1291/deck3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMbbcie95m1AM71celzdSMJyJvd4_LB_qJJ5JJwIQB7_ZYDCrYt7t6_jk5uEhC36vWTzvZOX9x9RyaL4j_JfQ45BI45vD4A3Og6JNbRF3CfRJJw0K0wiXKrVkgZqktNAjA6J8BTGudR21b3H-gv6r37vHy-MfjMMj3ORKEwKCv5v32mEUebCXZsvNyIkY/w640-h360/deck3.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/s1920/deck5.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEpG0z-K-5XgxxKwtHOK8DzPc7vNecEJ-fh3X5nzy8PQkp7vxhLxxKwKNnIBQpJWcd63keS5KIFhgM5F792cVMdbX8WVXBTEyt4YjTWkxaG3dcVXiUmLSutpTJc_saCyfugomSCPUAxaO9EgeeUnJpFFIQ4jk7AuoMMZ6YgOHuOqXrL8medWlEvc1Pn1k/w640-h360/deck5.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/s1296/deck4.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfTMW8dNfnztnHCKJZXVrcYbsp6L6tvNxSwy-cs9xh5-rjyQ6p01wYvtWNCwNxI5AusoUqr-YQaft47q7HodzJo3PDroG0NFyrRbv0OPeNdE3kLvFSe3Mk_ZzeEm8P7C2d0uygWSf-MjuuOzkUAwGPYvMy0TrVHn2QAyKMVS1d_GH0pxkKLW_jZ8VwBU/w640-h360/deck4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span face="Lato, sans-serif" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Later, in 2023, WIMO hosted a game jam internally and encouraged all teams to make VR games. Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build.

When the class tells you to build a program that does X and you find X as interesting as watching paint dry, that&#8217;s disturbingly close to what I do for a living all day, but at least there I get paid.</p>\n<p>However I&#8217;m not anywhere near the level of competency to dive into doing the things I want to learn Python for: AI stuff, like maybe Custom Nodes for Comfy UI or just basic user interfaces for whatever new open source LLM model is hot that week.</p>\n<p>I was thinking about what kind of newbie-friendly thing I could build that would be interesting to me, and my mind flew back to my first years of using a computer and what we&#8217;d spend all day on: games. In particular, games written in BASIC. There I&#8217;d be on my Atari 400 with its chicklet keyboard bruising my fingertips typing in code from some magazine. Then (after storing the program on a cassette tape!) I&#8217;d play the game a bit and soon after start modifying it since doing so was so easy. I learned a lot that way.</p>\n<h2>Rebuilding Retro BASIC Games in Python</h2>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_331" style="width: 1157px;"><a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/program-listing.jpg"><img alt="Partial screenshot of a page from 101 BASIC Computer Games showing some source code " class="size-full wp-image-331" height="650" src="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/program-listing.jpg" width="1157" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-331">Part of a page from 101 BASIC Computer Games</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Then inspiration struck! I could do the same with Python. And to keep it totally old school I found <a href="https://archive.org/details/101basiccomputer0000davi/mode/2up">101 BASIC Computer Games on Archive.org</a>. This not the 101 Computer Games book I had back in the day but it&#8217;s the same idea. (The one I had is listed at Amazon for $272!!) Of course I&#8217;m not typing in the code, I&#8217;m just replicating it in Python, and ideally making the games better. Most of these games were written by high school students back in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>So for example the first game: Acey Du, is a simpler variant of <a href="https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/in-between/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Acey Deucy</a> which is a simple game where you are dealt 2 cards and have to guess if the next card will fall between the two. In the book&#8217;s version the &#8216;cards&#8217; are just random numbers, not an exhaustible deck of cards, making it purely a guessing game. So I added a proper deck of cards meaning if you can remember what cards have been used you can make better guesses.</p>\n<p>This version had a betting system which I thought could act as a score. How much can you accumulate before the deck is exhausted? But then I thought &#8220;If I place a bet when the dealt cards are 2 and K it should pay less than if I place a bet when the cards are 5 and 9&#8221; so I&#8217;m going to change the odds based on the range of numbers between the two cards.</p>\n<p>And maybe I&#8217;ll add a high score table that&#8217;s written to a file and so persistent.</p>\n<p>And if I&#8217;m not bored by then, perhaps I&#8217;ll add a UI to it. Originally I was writing these just like BASIC programs: just a CLI and text feedback.</p>\n<p>So yeah, that&#8217;s my plan for now. Take an old BASIC game, get it working in Python, then make it better. Then throw it away and start on a new game.</p>\n<p>My next challenge will be figuring out how to turn off all the AI assistance I have in my IDE because the danged AI is always suggesting complete chunks of code that work well, before I&#8217;ve even had a moment to think about how I would accomplish the task at hand. Though, I dunno, in real world situations I&#8217;d have that all on and would welcome the suggestions so I&#8217;m still on the fence about that. Guess I could set aside VS Code and type up the programs in Sublime or even Notepad!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/21/back-to-basics-with-python/">Back to BASICs with Python</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/21/back-to-basics-with-python/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2'}

I had never heard of Phaser but ChatGPT suggested it as a good fit for my parameters which were that I wanted to write a game using some scripting or programming language that I could use for other purposes. I had at first suggested Pygame and I may go back to that. ChatGPT waved me off of that due (it said, I haven&#8217;t checked it yet) to it having no physics systems or tilemap editors. I will definitely be fact-checking this!</p>\n<p>My plan is to create a selection of super basic little &#8220;games&#8221; (eg move a sprite around a background, collide with something) in a few environments before I settle on one. I did it in Godot and Phaser and next I&#8217;ll do it in Pygame.</p>\n<p>So far Phaser is pretty fun. I&#8217;m running it via <a href="https://vite.dev/">Vite</a>, and the game itself runs in a browser. When I change the source code, Vite automagically &#8216;deploys&#8217; it without me having to restart anything, which makes the process delightfully iterative and kind of reminds me of plugging away on the chicklet keyboard of my Atari 400 writing Hangman games in BASIC!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Tuesday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 1, Module 2 Sub-Module 1</h3>\n<p>Didn&#8217;t even finish a complete sub-module today. <img alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f641.png" style="height: 1em;" /> But I moved a domain between registrars, got renter&#8217;s insurance sorted, wrote a blog post and snuck in some packing, so not going to beat myself up.

One was Intermediate Python which makes the most sense, but I&#8217;m instead going to go into Build Chatbots with Python since AI-related stuff is a big part of why I&#8217;m learning Python, AND it sounds fun (it&#8217;s marked as &#8220;Beginner&#8221; level) and something stress-free I can mess around with while we&#8217;re doing this move. </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Thursday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Build Chatbots With Python, Modules 1 &#8211; 4 </h3>\n<p>Turns out at some point I&#8217;d started this course which definitely get my a leg up on my progress!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Friday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Build Chatbots With Python, Modules Who Knows?</h3>\n<p>So it turns out CodeCademy re-uses modules within a subject, so as I moved through the Chatbots course I kept landing on things I&#8217;d already completed. Plus, the course seems out of date, which is understandable given how fast AI progress is moving. I was thinking Chatbot like something driven by AI and LLM, but this is more about scripted chatbots so far. Like &#8220;Write a program that takes a coffee order&#8221; via the user picking from a list of items. </p>\n<p>I think this might be where CodeCademy and I part ways and I just start building things on my own, but we&#8217;ll see. I have the weekend to think about it. I&#8217;ll either just start building stuff and learning that way, or I&#8217;ll go back to the Intermediate Python course. This Chatbot course just feels like busy work. On my last exercise I was scolded for using a loop because loops hadn&#8217;t been introduced yet!</p>\n<p>Side Note: Just to really throw my brain into confusion I started messing about with Godot (the open source game dev engine) last night so that&#8217;s yet ANOTHER thing I&#8217;m interested it!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/14/learning-journey-week-of-oct-13th-2025/">Learning Journey, Week of Oct. 13th, 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/10/14/learning-journey-week-of-oct-13th-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '4'}

I got access to it the other day and have been playing around with it and comparing it to Chrome with Gemini AI.</p>\n<p>First, and scariest, thing I did with it was give it access to my (mostly dormant these days) Gmail account and asked it to help me clean up my inbox. I had a zillion emails from LinkedIn and I asked it to find them all and delete them. It got to work, talking through each step: searching for the emails, clicking Select All. Hitting Delete. Waiting and watching to see if the number when down, then searching again for more and deleting those. It was crazy to watch my browser basically running itself. I could watch the AI clicking buttons and so forth.</p>\n<p>The bad news is that it wasn&#8217;t smart enough to know that in Gmail if you search for emails from a specific address, and change the sort from &#8220;Relevance&#8221; to &#8220;Recent&#8221; you get a prompt to select all emails matching your search and can delete everything at once. To be fair I had to ask Google Gemini how to get to that feature which had apparently disappeared. So I&#8217;m no smarter than Comet.</p>\n<p>So that was cool but also creepy and after I did that test I revoked its access to my Google account. </p>\n<h2>Video Summaries</h2>\n<p>For another test, I was watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivjwcZwMw4&#038;t">1 hour long YouTube video</a> that was an interview that I was vaguely interested in, but not &#8220;one hour of my time&#8221; interested in. I asked Gemini (in Chrome) to summarize the video and it gave me a summary based on, not the video, but the text around the video including the comments. Not helpful. I asked it to summarize the video itself and it told me it couldn&#8217;t watch the video.</p>\n<p>But in Comet I loaded the same YouTube video and asked Comet to summarize the video itself. It did so, and as I&#8217;d watched about half the video I know that it was a good summary of at least the first half. Here&#8217;s the full text of Comet&#8217;s summary:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nHere’s a summary of the main points from the video “AI killed Hollywood | Amazon&#8217;s secret AI bet | Ed Saatchi&#8217;s scary prediction”:</p>\n<p>&#8211; **AI is Creating a New Medium for Entertainment:** Edward Saatchi argues that AI isn&#8217;t just a tool for cheaper VFX or content automation; it&#8217;s giving birth to a completely new artistic medium. This medium is *playable*, *remixable*, and *multiplayer*—where audiences and creators can interact with AI-driven story worlds, create new episodes/characters, and expand existing universes, not just consume stitched clips.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **From Modding Games to Modding Movies:** The talk highlights parallels to video game modding—fans remixing and spinning off their own stories—which may change how film/TV IP is used, giving fans and creators more freedom to create derivative works inside established worlds, all monetized by the original IP holder.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Simulation Is Key to Realism:** Saatchi stresses that realistic AI storytelling requires true simulation—persistent worlds where characters have context, rules, relationships, and logical spatial/geographical structure (unlike current generative video, which often lacks consistency). These simulated worlds are what make emotional investment possible.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Fragmentation and Remix Culture:** The future of media is described as fragmentary and multiversal, with endless remixing. Everybody could have their own Star Trek or Friends spin-off, leading to a more individualized but potentially atomized culture.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **AI as an Artist and Competitor:** Rather than just being a creative assistant, AI can now independently generate art and narrative, making it a *competitor* to human artists. Human creators become worldbuilders—designing the universe, constraints, and rules that AI uses to generate content.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Navigating Social Media and AI:** As AI-driven personalized storytelling evolves, it may converge with social media, potentially amplifying both creativity and existing concerns—like recommendation algorithms, echo chambers, and digital social dynamics.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Playable Movies/TV and Genre Innovation:** There’s new potential for interactive genres like *playable horror*, where the viewer’s choices and prompts directly affect the story. Comedy and romance are also seen as ripe for AI-driven experimentation.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Technical Challenges:** The conversation notes that current AI-generated voices lack emotional depth, and long-term coherence in video simulation is still a challenge. Simulation here is not just about physics or aesthetics, but about character psychology and emergent, believable storylines.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Advice for Creators:** Saatchi predicts future “studios” will be AI model creators (OpenAI, Grok, Claude, etc.) and that artistic opportunity lies in treating these models as works of art, infusing them with taste and locked-in story elements.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Philosophical and Sci-Fi Visions:** The discussion connects to sci-fi themes (like Iain M. Banks’ Culture series), the possibility of AI-generated consciousness, and how simulations could serve both as entertainment and avenues for advancing creative AGI.</p>\n<p>&#8211; **Genre and Format Disruption:** AI may birth new genres, blend existing ones, and enable deeper audience participation (especially in horror and micro-drama formats).</p>\n<p>Overall, the video is a wide-ranging conversation about how AI will disrupt, transform, and expand the boundaries of storytelling, media, and creativity—beyond just Hollywood, into entirely new artistic universes and experiences, with big implications for culture, industry, and society.[1]</p>\n<p>[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivjwcZwMw4&#038;t=1224s)\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what it actually looks like (click to enlarge):<br />\n<a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comet_video.jpg"><img alt="Screenshot of Comet browser summarizing a video" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-278" height="1364" src="https://smithtalkstech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comet_video.jpg" width="1689" /></a></p>\n<p>So note one of the summaries talks about &#8220;playable horror&#8221; (not a new concept for gamers!) and I asked Comet to find that bit in the video, and it did:</p>\n<p><em>The video discusses playable horror starting at the 51:44 mark. If you want to watch that segment, jump to 51:44 in the video—that’s when the topic “Playable Horror: The Next Genre?” begins.</em></p>\n<p>Now this video does have chapters and Playable Horror is the name of a chapter, so hard to say if it got this info from the video or from the chapter listing. So I gave it another test. At one point the guest was talking about the TV show Friends and mentioned Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment. So I asked Comet to find the segment where they talk about Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment, without mentioning the TV show. I was not disappointed:</p>\n<p><em>The discussion about Chandler and Joey&#8217;s apartment from Friends begins around 12:18 in the video. Edward Saatchi uses it as an example to explain why simulations are important for AI-generated content. To catch this part, start watching at 12 minutes and 18 seconds.</em></p>\n<h2>Shopping</h2>\n<p>OK, one last test: Shopping! First, I had already logged into Amazon.com on the browser. I should&#8217;ve tested without having done that but here was my prompt:</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m almost out of Old Fashioned ingredients. Can you go to Amazon and put Orange Bitters, Peninsula Cherries and Collins Orange Twists in my cart? These should all be found in my previous orders so should be easy to find</strong></p>\n<p>It went to work searching my order history for these items, finding them and adding them to my cart. When it had all 3 in the cart it asked if I wanted it to complete the purchase. I said yes, and then had to agree again before it actually pressed the &#8220;Submit Order&#8221; button and then I got this:</p>\n<p><em>Your order has been successfully placed on Amazon with overnight delivery for all three cocktail ingredients—Collins Orange Twists, Peninsula Cherries, and Fee Brothers Orange Bitters. You’ll receive a confirmation email, and the order will be delivered to your default address by 4–8 AM tomorrow. Thanks for your request!</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth nothing that I did this via text but Comet does have the ability to take input via speech. </p>\n<p>Giving the AI that much access to my personal email definitely made me uneasy at this point though I suppose in a few years time I&#8217;ll think nothing of doing stuff like that. But having an AI that can summarize a long video is pretty darned handy given how often I end up sitting through videos looking for 1 piece of info. For that if nothing else, Comet is a win for me so far.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/25/comet-perplexitys-ai-browser/">Comet, Perplexity&#8217;s AI Browser</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/25/comet-perplexitys-ai-browser/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2'}

I find it can be a really helpful tool a lot of the time, and a pretty fun toy to mess around with, too.</p>\n<p>This is all really new so I don&#8217;t have comprehensive thoughts. At first I was kind of unimpressed. There&#8217;s a Gemini icon in the top right of the browser window, but so what? I have a Copilot button in my Task Bar. But then I was working on a Codecademy course and needed a refresher on the difference between append and extend for lists, so I hit that Gemini icon and asked the AI to give me the skinnny.</p>\n<p>It did so, but it also referenced the page I was on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Codecademy page you are on provides an example of how extend() can simplify code. In the &#8220;Performance&#8221; section, it suggests using thread_sold_split.extend(thread.split(&#8216;&#038;&#8217;)) as a more concise way to split and add thread colors to a list, compared to a nested loop. This is a great example of how extend() can replace a for loop that appends elements one by one.</p>\n<p>For more information and examples, you can check out resources like the Python List extend() Method article from GeeksforGeeks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So at this point you&#8217;re either saying &#8220;Oh shit Google is tracking every page I&#8217;m looking at!&#8221; or you&#8217;re saying &#8220;Whoa, that&#8217;s hella cool!&#8221; Or maybe both of those things. I said both but overall the cool aspect won out. </p>\n<p>To give this another test I opened the PDF of a lease agreement I happened to have on my machine, and asked for a summary. It read the PDF and gave me a nice table of all the pertinent info. Of course you can do the same with Chat GPT or any AI by just uploading a PDF, but if instead of a PDF this had been a long and complex post on the web, I&#8217;m assuming Gemini could&#8217;ve done the same thing. That seems like something that can be pretty useful.</p>\n<p>Also, unrelated to AI and I don&#8217;t know how new this is, but Chrome now handles multiple profiles really nicely. I have two Google accounts and by using Profiles I can keep them nicely separated (not sure how true that is for tracking purposes) with different extensions and such on each. There&#8217;s also a Guest profile which seems like Incognito on steroids. I&#8217;ve been using that for testing sites for work.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think I&#8217;m back to being a Chrome user now.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of my poor Python performance review and Gemini referencing the page.

I did learn that lambda functions are Pythons answer to anonymous functions, but most of the module was about passing parameters and such.</p>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 6 (Python: Code Challenges), Sub-Modules 1 &#038; 2</h3>\n<p>Simple exercises but they&#8217;re reinforcing some of the Python ways of doing things, so worth doing I think.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Tuesday</h2>\n<p>Had a freakishly slow work day so got a lot of modules done</p>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 6 (Python: Code Challenges), Sub-Modules 3 &#8211; 7</h3>\n<p>Lots more short exercises, some a bit more complex. Good practice for me</p>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 7 (Strings), Sub-Module 1 &#038; 2 (of 6)</h3>\n<p>Learning about string methods&#8230; once again more typing than learning, unfortunately</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Wednesday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 7 (Strings), Sub-Module 3 &#8211; 5 (of 6)</h3>\n<p>At this point Codecademy forked me over to a new course temporarily:</p>\n<h3>Codecademy Getting Started Off-Platform for Data Science, Module 1 (CLI) &#038; Module 2 (Using Jupyter Notebook)</h3>\n<p>This was mostly about getting conda (which I already had) &#038; Jupyter Notebook set up on your system, then a bit about using Jupyter Notebook, which it seems like CodeCademy is pushing us towards but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll use it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Thursday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy </p>\n<h3>Codecademy Getting Started Off-Platform for Data Science, Module 3 (Setting Up IDEs and Text Editors)</h3>\n<p>The next module in this course starts talking about relational databases so I think it&#8217;s time to swap back to the Python course for now.</p>\n<p>Note that Tokyo Game Show started today which was a pretty big distraction, so it was a slow learning day!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Friday</h2>\n<h3>Codecademy Learn Python 3 Course, Module 7 (Strings), Sub-Module 6</h3>\n<p>This was an actual programming exercise built around encrypting and decrypting secret messages. It was a good learning experience for me. Learned some hard lessons about mixing tabs and spaces, and had to do some thinking about manipulating lists and such. This finished the Strings module and as it was a Friday afternoon it felt like a good stopping point for the week!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/23/learning-journey-week-of-sept-22nd-2025/">Learning Journey, Week of Sept. 22nd, 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/23/learning-journey-week-of-sept-22nd-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

In the Lists module I finally learned what a tuple is. I knew it was a data structure in Python but that was all I knew. Basically it&#8217;s an immutable List.</p>\n<h2>Tuples</h2>\n<p>Or so I thought. Actually I just asked Coach Marissa about tuples and she scolded me for calling it an immutable list:</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><img alt="🧠" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f9e0.png" style="height: 1em;" /> So Why Not “Immutable List”?</h3>\n<p class="chakra-text css-1ltj640">Because a\xa0<strong class="chakra-text css-0">list</strong>\xa0and a\xa0<strong class="chakra-text css-0">tuple</strong>\xa0<em>behave</em>\xa0like siblings—but they’re\xa0<em>philosophically</em>\xa0different.</p>\n<table class="border-collapse border border-black px-3 py-1 dark:border-white">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class="break-words border border-black bg-gray-500 px-3 py-1 text-white dark:border-white">Feature</th>\n<th class="break-words border border-black bg-gray-500 px-3 py-1 text-white dark:border-white">List</th>\n<th class="break-words border border-black bg-gray-500 px-3 py-1 text-white dark:border-white">Tuple</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class="break-words border border-black px-3 py-1 dark:border-white"><strong class="chakra-text css-0">Intent</strong></td>\n<td class="break-words border border-black px-3 py-1 dark:border-white">“I’ll grow.

So in the name of due diligence <a href="https://realpython.com/python-mutable-vs-immutable-types/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I found a post</a> via conventional search and it seems to confirm that the AI wasn&#8217;t hallucinating. Can&#8217;t be too careful, though! Also &#8216;she&#8217; missed one point and it&#8217;s that tuples are smaller and faster to access, apparently.</p>\n<p>Any Python experts that read this and want to elaborate further in the comments would be MORE than welcome to do so!</p>\n<h2>List Comprehension</h2>\n<p>With Lists in the rearview mirror I started the Loops module. Submodule 1 was pretty basic until I got to List Comprehension which was a brand new concept for me.</p>\n<p>List Comprehensions, as far as I can tell, don&#8217;t offer anything that you can&#8217;t accomplish in a For loops but they&#8217;re supposed to be easier to read (possibly true if you&#8217;re familiar with them) and faster due to how Python is tuned (I&#8217;ll take that bit on faith).</p>\n<p>What I find weird is that the syntax changes depending on conditional</p>\n<p>So if you have a list:</p>\n<p><code>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code></p>\n<p>and you want to use List Comprehension to create a sub-list of all numbers over 4 you would do something like:</p>\n<p><code>over_4 = [ num for num in numbers <span style="color: #ff0000;">if num &gt; 4</span> ]</code></p>\n<p>But if you wanted a list of the odd numbers and the square of the even numbers you&#8217;d have to re-arrange things:</p>\n<p><code>odds_and_square_evens = [num <span style="color: #ff0000;">if num % 2 else num**2</span> for num in numbers]</code></p>\n<p>See how the conditional changes spots depending on if it has an else clause? Weird.</p>\n<p>For me, right now, that&#8217;s not easier to read than a traditional 4 loop but maybe I&#8217;ll get there eventually.</p>\n<h2>So Far, So Good</h2>\n<p>Have to say that writing these posts has so far been a good motivator for me and I&#8217;ve done more at CodeCademy in the past few days than I&#8217;ve done in the past few months.</p>\n<p>Today, for example, I had not finished the 2nd module and thought I was done for the day, but then wanted to make the Internet proud so went back and did more to finish it up. We&#8217;ll see how long that kind of motivation lasts but for now I&#8217;ll take it!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/22/learning-journey-day-3/">Learning Journey, Day 3</a> appeared first on <a href="https://smithtalkstech.com">Smith Talks Tech</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://smithtalkstech.com/2025/09/22/learning-journey-day-3/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}

For example, to get the length of list my_list you do len(&#8220;my_list&#8221;) whereas I&#8217;m used to doing my_list.length.

In reality, it\'s home to designers, singers, choreographers, photographers, business owners, and a strong mix of diverse roleplay experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/39847fe2-9b7f-4421-ab87-bf8ed4e0b04f/Off+to+Italy+Shi.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">One of those roleplay communities is focused on Greek Life found on HBCU campuses. I am a proud member and one of the founders of one such organization, Alpha Omega Mu. Founded in 2007, AΩM has been a passion of mine off and on throughout the years. AΩM has deep roots in honoring the Divine Nine, a collection of African American sororities and fraternities that started in the United States in the 1800s, and our focus on charity is a core part of who we are. For 18 years, we have raised funds for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and have also contributed to other organizations’ charity drives. Since returning to Second Life three years ago, I’ve spent much of my time focused on growing a strong and thriving sisterhood. This year has come with growing pains, but we’ve shifted our focus and are aiming to put roleplay at the forefront of our organization.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">There is a thriving Greek Letter community in Second Life, and while I sometimes take issue with the wider community (a blog post for another day), I am often amazed by the ingenuity and creativity you can find within it. This past week really brought that home for me, as my organization helped fellow Greeks Kappa Theta Phi II with their fall vacation event, Chalet Valdoro Fall Festival. The week-long event focused on smaller roleplay activities, from wine tasting and horseback riding (which AΩM hosted) to scuba diving, karaoke, and even an actual horse derby. Each event gave participants the opportunity to get to know one another, crack a few jokes, and unwind. It offered everyone a chance to step away from the hustle and bustle of the real world and experience, in essence, a vacation they might not be able to afford or find time for otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/ac1c726a-3811-4cde-b158-0189d9358510/Valdoro+Air.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">It also gave me the chance to remember why my first foray into online gaming was virtual worlds and making connections. Over time, I have become less and less social. I\'ve always been shy, but over the last few years, I\'ve somewhat become a hermit. I stick to my group and only my group, rarely venturing into new experiences and heavily vetting anyone I deal with. And yes, when you think sorority, you think social butterflies, so I know there is a weird juxtaposition there, which is why this week has been huge for me. During our wine tasting event, we tried something new for AΩM with a “Hot Ones” style segment inspired by the YouTube series, and everyone loved it. Three other organizations have already said they want to join in next time since we plan to film future sessions and share them on social media. As a matter of fact, I spent much of this morning joking around with some of the other people staying at the resort on the dedicated Discord server. We\'ve talked about collaborating on another vacation event and working together on our upcoming charity drives. There has been a real building of community this week that reminds me it\'s okay to step outside your comfort zone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/3797d40c-f54d-456d-84f7-61288e34d897/Hot+Ones.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/8be48f08-8149-44b3-805e-a1ac80cf61c8/Brunch+Time.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/f3400f94-6f3d-46b2-9d7d-1f6475bdf87d/Crystal+Cave.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">Second Life is full of subcultures most people never see, and Greek life is one of its most enduring and creative. What this week reminded me is that behind every avatar, there’s a person looking for connection, laughter, and belonging. The bonds we build through roleplay might start as stories, but over time they become something very real. If you\'re curious about how organizations like Alpha Omega Mu operate, or want to learn more about Greek roleplay in Second Life, let me know in the comments. I’d love to share more about this side of the world in a future post.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1760050772090-M0870QX6B7U66AZ99ZXZ/Off+to+Italy.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

As we looked out over the bay, I was struck by two things: how vast this world is, and how I ended up here with these two men. They call me a friend, and I am still in awe of them. To listen to them honor one another was humbling. Though tonight their words were not meant for me, but for each other, I felt them all the same. The struggle to live up to what once was, to what others believe we should be, is a battle I know all too well.</p><p class="">Eight years of war have carried me to this place. The Broken Isles, Zandalar and Kul Tiras, the otherworldly Shadowlands, and the Dragon Isles. One battleground after another, each demanding more of me, more of us, but each leaving scars unique to the person. For me, there was no pause, no moment to breathe until now. Listening to Thrall and Anduin, I realize that in war, none of us walk free of the dead. We simply learn to live beside them.</p><p class="">For the first time I can feel the calm before the storm. There is a charge in the air, but the wind that carries it is gentle and warm. I do not know how long it will last. I wish it would last forever. I know it is foolish to think the fighting is over. Even when the battlefield falls silent, the war never truly ends. But in this quiet, I find myself yearning. Yearning to understand how I, a simple Farstrider from Quel’Thalas, ended up here. What was the moment? What was the choice?</p><p class="">And yet, it is silly of me to even ask those questions. I know the answer. I might be too afraid to speak them aloud, but I know them. Perhaps during this in-between, I should read some of my old journals, to look back with some perspective. They do say time helps to round out the edges. So maybe, in reading my journals, I can be gentler with my choices, and if not that, then maybe just gentler with myself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=""><em>Author’s Note:</em><br />This marks the start of Zanaia’s story.

And honestly? That feels amazing. Fun escapism is on the horizon, and I’m here for it.</p><h4>Legion Remix</h4><p class="">Aside from the power-leveling of alts and awesome rewards, I have a feeling there are a few reasons why this is one of the expansions they decided to remix. From what I understand, Legion was one of the more popular expansions, but the end of the expansion also has strong lore ties to what is going on currently. I feel like they want us to go back for the story, or at least I want to go back for the story, and I’m just hoping they want us to as well.</p><p class="">I also think this ties into why they did the Mists of Pandaria remix, which I unfortunately missed. After watching episode 5 of a lore and history series on YouTube, <em>Before the Mists: What was Pandaria really like?</em> from Quaylin, I’ve been thinking a lot about the Thunder King and all the lore and history in Pandaria. (Also, highly recommend that series if you like lore: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEyTJ3_GpaHRKIZ31190_-OuxCTfCafXZ&amp;si=b-EWYQynXZojo_0O" target="_blank">Quaylin’s Playlist</a>).</p><p class="">On top of that, I want to create a short story that might turn into something longer for a character I’ve had in the back of my mind. Most, if not all, of my WoW characters have a backstory, but there’s one story in particular I want to play around with. I’m hoping it’ll help get me back into writing creatively and also make me a better writer. You know, the whole “practice makes perfect” thing. The first in that series is coming out next week, and I’m pretty excited about it.</p><h4>Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity</h4><p class="">As most of my friends know, I adore Guild Wars 2. It has such rich and deep lore, plus it does a really great job of giving you the story via your hero panel if you’ve been away awhile and forgotten what you were up to. Kind of like a gaming bookmark. On top of that, the game is visually stunning, and they just do a lot of things well that I feel some games (<em>cough</em> World of Warcraft <em>cough</em>) take and use for their own. Warbands, I’m looking at you.</p><p class="">I also recently got some new friends into the game. It’s such a delight seeing new players enjoy Guild Wars 2. At first, one of my friends was like, <em>“Oh, I’ll play when you’re on.”</em> Then the next thing I know, they went out and started exploring on their own. I was so proud of them! They’re gamers, but MMOs haven’t really been their thing before. Sadly, Lost Ark was their first MMO, and I was like, <em>“Girl, that is not a game you want to start with.”</em></p><p class="">And of course, the Halloween event is right around the corner. In real life, I’m not the hugest Halloween fan, but there’s something about the Guild Wars 2 version that brings me so much joy. It’s campy and lighthearted, with just the right touch of spooky and decoration. It’s always a good time, and I’m really looking forward to experiencing it with my friends.</p><h4>Dispatch &amp; Anno 117</h4><p class="">I’m looking forward to Dispatch and Anno 117 for different but also similar reasons. They’re both the kinds of games I love to sink into when I’m feeling socially overwhelmed and want to game without any pressure.</p><p class=""><strong>Anno 117</strong> is a city builder (my absolute favorite genre) that will take us to the Roman Empire this time around. I can’t wait to experiment with creating a city that not only functions well but also looks beautiful.</p><p class=""><strong>Dispatch</strong>, on the other hand, is a story-driven, choices-matter RPG with a superhero twist. It features an incredible cast of actors, including two of my favorites from the voice acting world, Travis Willingham and Laura Bailey, as well as Jeffrey Wright. I LOVE Jeffrey Wright.</p><p class="">Both games are ones I know I’ll enjoy for months and months: replaying Dispatch to explore different choices, and perfecting the greatest city I can in Anno.</p><h4>WoW Player Housing</h4><p class="">I cannot even contain my excitement for player housing coming to WoW. I love to decorate in any game that lets me, which is why I adore city builders. Decorating scratches a creative itch for me since I can’t really do that in real life. HGTV is one of my all-time favorite channels, and I’ve basically been using games as my own personal HGTV show ever since The Sims 1 released.</p><p class="">The controls for decorating in WoW also look really similar to Second Life, which I have a lot of experience with. I even have an interior design business in SL, so I know I’ll be able to pull off some pretty amazing things. Once December 2nd rolls around, I’m going to be knee-deep in not only decorating my house but also leveling up the renown for it so I can have <em>all the things</em>!</p><p class="">I also plan to showcase myself decorating and the whole process that goes into it. That should be a lot of fun, kind of like a virtual MMO version of HGTV. Maybe that’ll be the moment I give YouTube another try… probably not, but at the very least I have this space to share all my design ideas.</p><h4>Countdown to Cozy Chaos</h4><p class="">So that is everything on the horizon until the end of the year. I haven’t had this much gaming content to bring me joy in such a long time. It’s hard not to be overwhelmed, but also it feels like being a kid waiting for their birthday or Christmas. Which is ironic because both my birthday and Christmas will be in the middle of all these things.</p><p class="">So if you need me between now and the holidays, you’ll find me happily lost in one of these worlds. Much excite, indeed.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759370554986-2X8R5BJOO4FD5A3AAJ7H/Much+Excite.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

To say I’ve blogged in the past would be an understatement. I’ve had several, all short lived, so we’ll see how this goes. Lately the quick bursts I toss on Mastodon don’t feel like enough. “But blogging? That’s so old school,” I hear you say. Yes, a blog. I know it’s 2025, but I don’t want to stream. Making YouTube videos isn’t on the table for now. So here we are. Fingers to keyboard, thoughts to screen.</p><p class="">So what is this place? Exactly what it says on the tin: a blog. A spot to pull together the ways I play, explore, and create in games. Sometimes that means roleplay stories where characters start writing themselves. Other times it’s screenshots that capture moments I want to hold onto. And sometimes it’s just me reflecting on the gaming experience, the joy, the chaos, the little obsessions of whatever I’m into that week.</p><p class="">My gaming tastes are all over the map, and that’s how I like it. One day I’m chasing achievements in Guild Wars 2. The next I’m running delves in World of Warcraft. Or desperately trying to keep the tiny people in Frostpunk from freezing to death. If it’s a world worth exploring or a puzzle worth figuring out, odds are I’ll end up there.</p><p class="">Ready Pixel One isn’t about guides or dissecting patch notes. It’s about what happens inside the games and inside my head while I play them. It’s the spark of a new MMO story, the random character I get too attached to, the screenshots I can’t stop taking. A mix of RP stories, personal reflections, and snapshots from the journey.</p><p class="">This first post is just me setting the stage. There’s more to come, characters to meet, worlds to visit, and plenty of pixels to share along the way.</p><p class="">So… Pixel One has joined the game.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759292672837-C734CUZR5FF3N0TH5AYW/Ready+Pixel+One.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

At the end of each level you get a brief moment of respite at a camp where you can pick up and buy powerups, take or turn in quests, and go make another tea in the kitchen before returning to your computer before venturing ever-further into the fantastical worlds of Purgatory.</p>\n<p>At first glance, the game doesn&rsquo;t look like a Roguelike. Even in the most loose definition of the term - it&rsquo;s vertically scrolling and action-driven. If anything, it seems to have more in common with something like River Raid or 1942 than a dungeon crawler. But to me, where it starts to show its lineage is when it comes to do level design in the game.</p>\n<p>In terms of my work on the project, I&rsquo;m designing &amp; writing the game with Ron, but probably the majority of my time is spent doing the level design. As such, I felt like that was a good place to start when writing a guest blog post - I could focus on one of the only things I actually do more than Ron on the game.</p>\n<p>In the most superficial sense, the game&rsquo;s levels are top-down 2d level prefabs designed in <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a>, a very useful open-source tile-based map editor, and stitched together at run-time by the game.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image2.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The individual pieces (we refer to them as prefabs) each have different bits of meta data attached to them such as their Land (or biome), what kind of prefab they are, what other prefabs they can attach to and what the probability is that they might appear, what mobs can spawn, etc.</p>\n<p>For instance, a very simple, short bit of green grass with a small hill and some simple decorations might be pretty common, and appear regardless of what level you&rsquo;re at, where-as a more complex prefab featuring a maze may be rare, limited to higher levels only, and might be flagged to only appear once in a level.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image3.jpeg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Using this metadata we can set it up so that early levels are shorter, simpler, and contain fewer ‘puzzle’ prefabs (what we call the more complex prefabs that have optional mazes, gates or enemy ambushes in them).</p>\n<p>If a new player starts on the first level of a run (which is always in the grassy Land), the prefabs that get chosen to assemble the level are different to, say, the 15th level for a player who&rsquo;s unlocked lots of upgrades and is currently in the Swamp land.</p>\n<p>So, to create a single Land means designing the aesthetics, the enemies that occupy its levels, the basic gameplay style, and then, finally, a good hundred or more prefabs that make it up.</p>\n<p>Doing those first bits isn&rsquo;t easy, but it isn&rsquo;t as time consuming as the weeks and months spent making up all the prefabs. This process usually has three steps.</p>\n<p>First step: drinking coffee.</p>\n<p>Second step: coming up with basic shapes and paths. This I tend to do in batches, doodling in a notepad or on my tablet, sometimes at a cafe, on a train, or really anywhere that isn&rsquo;t my work desk (for a change).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image4.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>With enough of these basic shapes figured out in varying levels of detail, it&rsquo;s then time for-</p>\n<p>Third step: spend days in Tiled, creating first at first the basic layouts, then adding more aesthetic detail.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image5.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I usually alternate between doing all three of these critical steps - a few hours in Tiled, then going for a walk to clear my head, get a coffee, and come up with some more prefab ideas.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s this design process that to me really drives home how much the game is a Roguelike (or is at least related to them - ask two fans of roguelikes what makes something a roguelike and you will get five different answers).</p>\n<p>Just like designing most any other Rogue-adjacent game, it also means that staring at prefabs and their metadata until your eyes go square won&rsquo;t truly tell if what you&rsquo;ve built plays well. Great ideas on paper don&rsquo;t always work. Or maybe they do, but with a few powerups they become too easy (or too hard).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image6.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>In Tiled, shown above, we have data layers that exist along with aesthetic ones. Different data types (each a unique colour for easy recognition) can be painted on that layer to allow the prefab designer to, for instance, stop a player jumping onto that square, stop power-ups from randomly spawning there, or forcing a square to be non-passible.</p>\n<p>Which means built into this prefab design cycle is also a crap-ton of testing. From almost the very start we&rsquo;ve had regular QA and play-testing done at least a few hours a week. What puzzles are too hard when you&rsquo;re moving at speed? What other forms end up being fun and should be put into more prefabs?</p>\n<p>Even the simple act of adding more prefabs can unbalance the game if we aren&rsquo;t careful. Add 20 more prefabs to a given Land, and suddenly those rare ones you made might occur less frequently than you&rsquo;d like.</p>\n<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s meant that designing this game has been a massively cyclic process. Adding features, prefabs, or puzzles, tinkering with them, experimenting, and even removing some if they turn out to have been better left on that scrap of napkin at the cafe down the road from my place.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<p><em>Hi there!

At the end of each level you get a brief moment of respite at a camp where you can pick up and buy powerups, take or turn in quests, and go make another tea in the kitchen before returning to your computer before venturing ever-further into the fantastical worlds of Purgatory.</p>\n<p>At first glance, the game doesn&rsquo;t look like a Roguelike. Even in the most loose definition of the term - it&rsquo;s vertically scrolling and action-driven. If anything, it seems to have more in common with something like River Raid or 1942 than a dungeon crawler. But to me, where it starts to show its lineage is when it comes to do level design in the game.</p>\n<p>In terms of my work on the project, I&rsquo;m designing &amp; writing the game with Ron, but probably the majority of my time is spent doing the level design. As such, I felt like that was a good place to start when writing a guest blog post - I could focus on one of the only things I actually do more than Ron on the game.</p>\n<p>In the most superficial sense, the game&rsquo;s levels are top-down 2d level prefabs designed in <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a>, a very useful open-source tile-based map editor, and stitched together at run-time by the game.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image2.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The individual pieces (we refer to them as prefabs) each have different bits of meta data attached to them such as their Land (or biome), what kind of prefab they are, what other prefabs they can attach to and what the probability is that they might appear, what mobs can spawn, etc.</p>\n<p>For instance, a very simple, short bit of green grass with a small hill and some simple decorations might be pretty common, and appear regardless of what level you&rsquo;re at, where-as a more complex prefab featuring a maze may be rare, limited to higher levels only, and might be flagged to only appear once in a level.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image3.jpeg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Using this metadata we can set it up so that early levels are shorter, simpler, and contain fewer ‘puzzle’ prefabs (what we call the more complex prefabs that have optional mazes, gates or enemy ambushes in them).</p>\n<p>If a new player starts on the first level of a run (which is always in the grassy Land), the prefabs that get chosen to assemble the level are different to, say, the 15th level for a player who&rsquo;s unlocked lots of upgrades and is currently in the Swamp land.</p>\n<p>So, to create a single Land means designing the aesthetics, the enemies that occupy its levels, the basic gameplay style, and then, finally, a good hundred or more prefabs that make it up.</p>\n<p>Doing those first bits isn&rsquo;t easy, but it isn&rsquo;t as time consuming as the weeks and months spent making up all the prefabs. This process usually has three steps.</p>\n<p>First step: drinking coffee.</p>\n<p>Second step: coming up with basic shapes and paths. This I tend to do in batches, doodling in a notepad or on my tablet, sometimes at a cafe, on a train, or really anywhere that isn&rsquo;t my work desk (for a change).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image4.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>With enough of these basic shapes figured out in varying levels of detail, it&rsquo;s then time for-</p>\n<p>Third step: spend days in Tiled, creating first at first the basic layouts, then adding more aesthetic detail.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image5.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I usually alternate between doing all three of these critical steps - a few hours in Tiled, then going for a walk to clear my head, get a coffee, and come up with some more prefab ideas.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s this design process that to me really drives home how much the game is a Roguelike (or is at least related to them - ask two fans of roguelikes what makes something a roguelike and you will get five different answers).</p>\n<p>Just like designing most any other Rogue-adjacent game, it also means that staring at prefabs and their metadata until your eyes go square won&rsquo;t truly tell if what you&rsquo;ve built plays well. Great ideas on paper don&rsquo;t always work. Or maybe they do, but with a few powerups they become too easy (or too hard).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dbs7_image6.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>In Tiled, shown above, we have data layers that exist along with aesthetic ones. Different data types (each a unique colour for easy recognition) can be painted on that layer to allow the prefab designer to, for instance, stop a player jumping onto that square, stop power-ups from randomly spawning there, or forcing a square to be non-passible.</p>\n<p>Which means built into this prefab design cycle is also a crap-ton of testing. From almost the very start we&rsquo;ve had regular QA and play-testing done at least a few hours a week. What puzzles are too hard when you&rsquo;re moving at speed? What other forms end up being fun and should be put into more prefabs?</p>\n<p>Even the simple act of adding more prefabs can unbalance the game if we aren&rsquo;t careful. Add 20 more prefabs to a given Land, and suddenly those rare ones you made might occur less frequently than you&rsquo;d like.</p>\n<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s meant that designing this game has been a massively cyclic process. Adding features, prefabs, or puzzles, tinkering with them, experimenting, and even removing some if they turn out to have been better left on that scrap of napkin at the cafe down the road from my place.</p>'}}

I could make it a lot smarter, but what I really need is tool that stress tests the game so smarts of low on the list.</p>\n<p>I can leave it running overnight and it plays thousands of levels and in the morning I see if any errors occurred or if there are memory leaks.</p>\n<p>None so far.</p>\n<p>Its been a great tool for consoles because we can only do limited testing before sending it to outside testers due to limited dev kits<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss#fn:1">1</a></sup>, so running TesterTron3000 on it for 24 hours is good piece of mind.</p>\n<p>There are little animation glitches because it&rsquo;s not running through the normal controller code and I&rsquo;ve spotted some missing sfx.</p>\n<p>TesterTron3000 is written 100% in Dinky and only about 100 lines of code.</p>\n<p>I might ship it with the final game as an attract mode, but it&rsquo;s kind of buggy, has bad path finding, and really stupid so I worry players would fixate on what it&rsquo;s not doing right.  It&rsquo;s not a tool for playing the game with any degree is skill, it&rsquo;s a stress tester and a dev tool.</p>\n<p>But, it&rsquo;s fun to watch.</p>\n<p>\u200f</p>\n\n    <div style="padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">\n      \n    </div>\n\n<p>\u200f</p>\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:1">\n<p>Something a lot of people don&rsquo;t know is for consoles you need special dev kits to test with, it&rsquo;s not like the PC (or even the SteamDeck) where you can use any device.

But more important is there is no human interaction, so there is less chance of a mistake being made.</p>\n<p>To upload to Steam you need to authenticate, which usually involves getting an email and typing in a code or doing the same with their authentication app. It&rsquo;s not very conducive to automated builds.</p>\n<p>Fortunately <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading#automating_steampipe">Steam has an process</a> where you authenticate once and then pass a token from the command line and that logs you in without a password. Wonderful.</p>\n<p>This worked fine for what seem like years, then on Jan 1, 2025 I got a error saying my token was expired. OK, makes some sense.</p>\n<p>I re-ran the process to get a new token and everything was fine for a day or so, then it failed again saying the token was expired. Then it happened again. And again.</p>\n<p>Frustrated, I reached out to the friend who works at Valve and was put in contact with a programmer there. He watched the back-end and said everything was fine for the first few auths and then the old expired token as submitted.  Rebuilding the token worked for a while and then the old token was submitted again.</p>\n<p>We began to suspect the token file on my machine was being overwritten but I couldn&rsquo;t see it happening and didn&rsquo;t know how it was happening.

(1) You have options on how to act and what to do after you acted, (2) these choices impact the game and future choices, both in the near future and far future; and (3) when playing for the first time I didn&rsquo;t feel like I had a choice, there was only thing my character would have done.</li>\n<li>I like sidequest with &ldquo;treasure hunt&rdquo; like the maps in Red Dead Redemption</li>\n<li>I like tiny quests about interpersonal relationships, like resolving a conflict between a mortician and his gravedigger employee in Ultima 6, or babysitting a dock worker&rsquo;s daughter in Citizen Sleeper.</li>\n<li>the Tarrey Town quest arc from Zelda Breath of the Wild is one of my all time favorites. It&rsquo;s really just a series of supply fetch quests and &ldquo;find yet another character whose name rhymes with &lsquo;son&rsquo; (in this big huge open world)&rdquo; but it <em>feels</em> like you are helping establish an entire new town in the wilderness - leaves you with a genuine &ldquo;I helped people&rdquo; feeling. After which it becomes a real town that is quite a useful outpost with lots of new quests it opens up in turn.</li>\n<li>I like quests where you have to run around between a few characters, doing small tasks for them or delivering messages between them to get them to work together eventually.\nLike with getting Olga and Boris to make up in Quest for Glory 4, or the Chinese hitmen quest in VtM: Bloodlines.</li>\n<li>quests that leave lasting impact on the game world (like rebuilding a village, changing the landscape, that sort of thing)</li>\n<li>one that comes to mind is having to sneakily follow someone to find out what they&rsquo;re up to without them noticing</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;ll have to come back to this, but I think scenarios are important. Why you are doing the quest isn&rsquo;t always as important as what you do during the quest.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m currently playing through Baldurs Gate 3 and in one instance i began fighting one group of enemies, only for another to show up that distracted them. Essentially you have to use this distraction effectively to win the fight because it collects the enemies in a group and the interjecting enemy eventually leaves. If you didn&rsquo;t do enough with it, you are left with an army of enemies.</li>\n<li>I also like murder mysteries. Locked in a house or something, talk to people, figure out who is the killer.</li>\n<li>There was another game where during a fight a fire is spreading, so you have to manage the fight while getting distance from the fire. If you move too quick the enemies are able to surround you, too slow or let someone get knocked down, the fire gets them.</li>\n<li>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s super important for a game to be incredibly hard or easy or whatever. I think the sweet spot for video games is &lsquo;hard enough that I need to pay attention, and no harder.&rsquo;</li>\n<li>different outcomes for people or places. For example, depending on your efficiency on solving the quest (or on decisions), you save a family or they get killed; or someone gets in debt with you and will help you later or he will hire killers to slay you; you may save a town from evil wizards or it may be cursed with fatal consequences</li>\n<li>I like quests with options. Say I need to get inside the castle. Is my only option stealth? Or could I bribe the guard, or seduce the guard, or distract the guard, or find an old tunnel from the monastery?</li>\n<li>Quests that do world building. I loved all the side quests in The Witcher 3 for example. They were all unique little stories in the Witcher universe, making the game more immersive as you played it.</li>\n<li>There was one in Neverwinter Nights with a glass sphere that contained a parallel world? And One in Dragon Age with a mouse hole. - Can´t remember exactly.Generally ones that are less predictable but logical to solve.</li>\n<li>I always liked questions where I brought NPCs back together or highly political strategic ones ;)</li>\n<li>I love it when quests are smaller pieces of bigger quests. For example in GTA when you do heists, a few missions set up the heist then you perform the actual heist which makes use of the earlier things you did.</li>\n<li>I love ones that involve mystery. The Dark Brotherhood questline in TES: Oblivion comes to mind. Specifically &ldquo;Whodunit&rdquo;, where you participate in a murder mystery party where you are the murderer.</li>\n<li>first thing that came to mind was the spell book in King&rsquo;s Quest 6. Travel around gathering ingredients (which didn&rsquo;t feel tedious as you needed to Island-hop for other story &amp; puzzle reasons) then cast spells that advance the story. Not all spells were required due to different ways to win the game.</li>\n<li>Helping a NPC gets you a pet/sidekick</li>\n<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloody_Baron">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloody_Baron</a></li>\n<li>may I chime in? I like quests which turn out to be something completely different than you expect, and where the good writing/setup makes you forget that its a scripted event. RPG or adventure, makes no difference. Most memorable quest: Warhead on Amiga, where you eatch Constrictor annihilate the entire Sirius fleet with single missile (while going la-de-da), and then you get mission from your headquarters to go and attack it</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m fine with them being tiny impacts on the world. if I&rsquo;m fetching an hat for the person, the person wears it after. If I fetch an item for a shopkeeper, it increases stock</li>\n<li>If there&rsquo;s a side quest where I need to make medicine because someone is sick, I need to do it immediately</li>\n<li>The quests where we need to make choices (maybe moral ones) with consequences hard to predict. Hag quest in Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3 is one of my favourite quests, for example.</li>\n<li>Legend of Mana, the lamp selling quest: <a href="https://mana.fandom.com/wiki/Lumina_(location)#Faeries\'_Light">https://mana.fandom.com/wiki/Lumina_(location)#Faeries&rsquo;_Light</a> You had to learn the Dudbears&rsquo; language and answer their questions. <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/256525-legend-of-mana/faqs/7963">https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/25652</a></li>\n<li>I like the help korok to reach his friend in Tears of the Kingdom. (Although many seem to prefer to torture them) Most of it because of the sound. The koroks really sound sad and distressed but when you put them together you hear the sound of relief. &ldquo;Helping them&rdquo; is a good theme by itself but the sound really adds to the feeling and role play.</li>\n<li>I like quest for adding new team members That was old chaps from the original once</li>\n<li>quests that affect the ending for sure, even if it&rsquo;s an extra sprite in the lineup. It blew my child mind they you can save Luca&rsquo;s mom from losing her legs in Chrono Trigger and it affected that particular line of endings (game has over a dozen). It&rsquo;s a thing you end up having to do regardless, a little action sequence, but it&rsquo;s hard enough to not telegraph in any way that it&rsquo;s actually possible to win and save your mom. Like it seems as if you&rsquo;re supposed to simply relive trauma.</li>\n<li>i like the ones that get initiated by the player - technically, it&rsquo;s you who just walked up to a random person and tried to ask what&rsquo;s up.</li>\n<li>one I did yesterday while playing Mario rpg. The quest triggers when you arrive in a town and you meet a trio of characters that tell you they hid something around the world, and they give you clues like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s genuine a wooden flower&rdquo; or &ldquo;under a green bed&rdquo;. You have to revisit and find these things. I liked it, solving the clues made me feel smart, and the places I revisited felt deeper now.</li>\n<li>The &ldquo;small favor&rdquo; ones, where you start with a very simple task but it slowly unfurls into an endless quest.</li>\n<li>I really like the quests that seem simple at first but reveal a lot of world behind them. Like, the initial quest is &ldquo;get me some widgets&rdquo; but you start looking into why there&rsquo;s a widget shortage and you discover the frobnicator is down due to sabotage because there are warring factions of frobnicator builders and their disagreements are deep-seated, sensible, and not trivially solvable. Then the wish fulfillment part is that you solve them.</li>\n<li>The ones where, just when you have everything ready to turn in for a reward, you suddenly get new information casting doubt on whether you should do so, and have to make a choice about which side to take. It&rsquo;s that moment of player agency right after a stretch of non-agency, doing stuff because someone else told you to.</li>\n<li>I like quests where you&rsquo;ve been manipulated to side with someone. You do their quest, and then they destroy the town, kill the king, release the kraken etc..setting you up for quests to undo what you did.</li>\n<li>The ones that stick with me involve making choices that seem unconnected until later (e.g. the treatment of specific monsters in Witcher 3 affecting the fates of characters you may or may not meet) or that build connections with people and places (like how completing a fetch quest or taking care of a problem aids in reconstructing a colony in Xenoblade Chronicles).</li>\n<li>Mass Effect 2 - been a while but I recall caring enough about the party members that doing their personal quests seemed like an intrinsically motivated thing to do. Basically either give me a good enough motivation to do the quest, or keep the downside/extra effort low. And please don&rsquo;t try to abuse my FOMO.</li>\n<li>Witcher 3 - Practicum quest. Funny, and builds  NPC character (which they don&rsquo;t do much with after). I also enjoy the simpler contracts as &ldquo;go there, kill huge thing&rdquo; fits the game.</li>\n<li>The hunted hotel from Vampire Bloodlines is one quest I will always remember. Not because is a brilliant quest, but because the twist of the mood of the game. Suddenly, I&rsquo;m in a horror game and still it uses the mechanics from the general game. I love that quest.</li>\n<li>I just did a quest* in GuildWars2 where I collected bits of a renowned family&rsquo;s tapestry from all over the world, starting in the previous big expac. Like the Snargle Goldclaw achievements (look him up), I liked how this connected to the changing world of the story, but on the fringes. It connected to NPCs I&rsquo;d heard arguing about mass-producing artisan blankets now that borders were open and&hellip;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;signs of the sojourner&rdquo; has beautifully done quests. there&rsquo;s an overarching quest to learn about your mom, and progress comes naturally through conversation games (the game&rsquo;s main mechanic). you receive additional tasks, like to bring back vinegar or a musical instrument, and if you don&rsquo;t complete these, the outcome of your game is changed. then there are fetch quests for individual characters and exit ramps through certain characters. it&rsquo;s very artfully put together, to me.</li>\n<li>Some memorable quests: In &ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Dogma,&rdquo; breaking into the Duke&rsquo;s castle to rescue a princess. Also, stealing a ring for the Duke, forging it, giving him the forgery, and using the original to rob him dry.</li>\n<li>Anything which has a lasting effect on the Gameworld. Megaton in Fallout 3 being an easy example.</li>\n<li>The Purification quest in Oblivion at the end of the Dark Brotherhood questline, when you have to kill al the NPCs of the brotherhood you have been getting quests from and interacting with. It felt so weird.</li>\n</ul>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<p>I recently asked on <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@grumpygamer">Mastodon</a> about favorite quests.

I am getting something from RtMI but it&rsquo;s small. I&rsquo;ve created a lot over the years and only made other people rich.</p>\n<p>I support the game industry unionizing, not only to create reasonable working hours, but also to stop companies from getting rich off our hard creative work. I don&rsquo;t think game writers should be part of the WGA, the businesses are too different, and I&rsquo;ve seen the cluster fuck of Hollywood unions trying to get into games.</p>\n<p>Unions can also be their own oppressive mess but it&rsquo;s probably slightly better than what we have now. I do worry about how rigid unions would hamper true indie game work.</p>'}}

We talked over ideas we&rsquo;d had over the years including one of mine where Guybrush wakes up 3000 years in the future on a snowball Earth.</p>\n<p>We talked about my original &ldquo;hell&rdquo; idea but other Monkey Island games had already done much of that (by pure coincidence) and there was little point in rehashing it.</p>\n<p>The one thing I wanted to do was start the new game right where LeChuck&rsquo;s Revenge ended, and that became the one unmovable stone.</p>\n<p>I have made one pixel art game in my entire career and that was Thimbleweed Park.  Monkey Island 1 and 2 weren&rsquo;t pixel art games. They were games using state-of-the-art tech and art. Monkey Island 1 was 16 color EGA and we jumped at the chance to upgrade it to 256 colors.  Monkey Island 2 featured the magical wizardry of scanned art by Peter Chan and Steve Purcell and we lusted to keep pushing everything forward.</p>\n<p>If I had stayed and done Monkey Island 3 it wouldn&rsquo;t have looked like Monkey Island 2. We would have kept pushing forward, and Day of the Tentacle is a good example of that.</p>\n<p>I never liked the art in DotT.  Technically and artistically it was fantastic, but I never liked the wacky Chuck Jones style.  But that was Dave and Tim&rsquo;s game, not mine. They can do what they want and I completely supported that.</p>\n<p>Curse of Monkey Island also took a leap forward. It introduced us to a fully voiced and taller, lankier Guybrush with painted backgrounds that were all the rage in the late 90s.  It was very much a game of its time.</p>\n<p>When Dave and I first started brainstorming Return to Monkey Island we talked about pixel art, but it didn&rsquo;t feel right. We didn&rsquo;t want to make a retro game. You can&rsquo;t read an article about Thimbleweed Park without it being called a &ldquo;throwback game&rdquo;.  I didn&rsquo;t want Return to Monkey Island to be just a throwback game, I wanted to keep moving Monkey Island forward because it&rsquo;s interesting, fun, and exciting. It&rsquo;s what the Monkey Island games have always done.</p>\n<p>I wanted the art in Return to Monkey Island to be provocative, shocking, and not what everyone was expecting.  Rex is an amazing creative force and we have a team of incredible artists, animators, sound designers, programmers, and testers all pouring their souls into this game and it&rsquo;s beautiful to see, play, and listen to.</p>\n<p>The music Michael, Peter, and Clint are doing is equally amazing.  It&rsquo;s not AdLib, Sound Blaster, or even Roland MT-32 music. Its stunning, interactive, and recorded live.</p>\n<p>Return to Monkey Island may not be the art style you wanted or were expecting but it&rsquo;s the art style I wanted.</p>\n<p>When I started this game my biggest fear was Disney wouldn&rsquo;t let me make the game I wanted to make but they have been wonderful to work with.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that the people who don&rsquo;t want me to make the game I want to make are some of the hard core Monkey Island fans. And that is what makes me sad about all the comments.</p>\n<p>Return to Monkey Island is an incredible rollercoaster.  Get on and have some fun or stomp out of the amusement park because it&rsquo;s not exactly the rollercoaster you wanted.</p>\n<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll jump on with the rest of us.</p>\n<p><a href="https://grumpygamer.com/if_i_made_another_monkeyisland">*Seventeen</a> - The game would be the game I wanted to make. I don&rsquo;t want the pressure of trying to make the game you want me to make. I would vanish for long periods of time. I would not constantly keep you up-to-date or be feeding the hype-machine.

It was very much a game of its time.</p>\n<p>When Dave and I first started brainstorming Return to Monkey Island we talked about pixel art, but it didn&rsquo;t feel right. We didn&rsquo;t want to make a retro game. You can&rsquo;t read an article about Thimbleweed Park without it being called a &ldquo;throwback game&rdquo;.  I didn&rsquo;t want Return to Monkey Island to be just a throwback game, I wanted to keep moving Monkey Island forward because it&rsquo;s interesting, fun, and exciting. It&rsquo;s what the Monkey Island games have always done.</p>\n<p>I wanted the art in Return to Monkey Island to be provocative, shocking, and not what everyone was expecting.  Rex is an amazing creative force and we have a team of incredible artists, animators, sound designers, programmers, and testers all pouring their souls into this game and it&rsquo;s beautiful to see, play, and listen to.</p>\n<p>The music Michael, Peter, and Clint are doing is equally amazing.  It&rsquo;s not AdLib, Sound Blaster, or even Roland MT-32 music. Its stunning, interactive, and recorded live.</p>\n<p>Return to Monkey Island may not be the art style you wanted or were expecting but it&rsquo;s the art style I wanted.</p>\n<p>When I started this game my biggest fear was Disney wouldn&rsquo;t let me make the game I wanted to make but they have been wonderful to work with.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that the people who don&rsquo;t want me to make the game I want to make are some of the hard core Monkey Island fans. And that is what makes me sad about all the comments.</p>\n<p>Return to Monkey Island is an incredible rollercoaster.  Get on and have some fun or stomp out of the amusement park because it&rsquo;s not exactly the rollercoaster you wanted.</p>\n<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll jump on with the rest of us.</p>\n<p><a href="https://grumpygamer.com/if_i_made_another_monkeyisland">*Seventeen</a> - The game would be the game I wanted to make. I don&rsquo;t want the pressure of trying to make the game you want me to make. I would vanish for long periods of time. I would not constantly keep you up-to-date or be feeding the hype-machine. I&rsquo;d show stuff that excited me or amused me. If you let me do those things, you will love the game. That, I promise.</p>'}}

Is it so hard to send an email?</p>\n<p>My $160 Apple Airpods stopped connecting to my Mac. The error: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Connect&rdquo;. Ok, so why! How about a little information! It&rsquo;s due to arrogance.  Apple products &ldquo;just work&rdquo; so there is no need for an error message.</p>\n<p>For months now iPhotos won&rsquo;t download new photos from the Photosteam? Why? No error. No information. I used to be able to click a button and import photos directly from the phone&hellip; that is now gone? Why? Because Apple products &ldquo;just work&rdquo;.  Dear Apple: You suck at the cloud.</p>\n<p>My next phone won&rsquo;t be a iPhone.</p>\n<p>Apple has locked down the Mac is such hamfisted way that it&rsquo;s getting hard to be a developer (let alone a user) on the Mac.  Admit that your heart was in the right place but you botched the implementation of the sandbox and come up with some that protects people and also respects us.  Ben Franklin&rsquo;s quote works for operating systems just as well: &ldquo;Those who desire to give up freedom in order to gain security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m really getting tried of Apple apologists who are basically the MAGA/Fox News equivalents for Apple. Any criticism is quickly countered with praise or excuses. Any critique of Apple is followed with awe over some new product. Apple is never going to fix #1 if you keep praising #2. Why would they?</p>\n<p>Please explain to me why the wealthiest company in the world still has the same open bugs year after year after year.  Hire some more programmers&hellip; it&rsquo;s not rocket science.</p>\n<p>My day-to-day home use as moved to Linux&hellip; but Linux is also a mess.  Why isn&rsquo;t there a good high quality IDE for C++ on Linux? I&rsquo;ve tried them all&hellip; WTF.  Just be as good as Xcode or VS (it&rsquo;s not a high bar).</p>\n<p>This might be good time to give up on computers.  Cabin in the woods, scruffy beard, flannel shirt.  Bonus points if my new best friend is a grizzly bear.</p>\n<p>P.S. I promise my next post will be about Lego. That is assuming Lego doesn&rsquo;t add DRM&hellip; you know&hellip; for my protection</p>'}}

The frustration reached a boiling point last week when for no reason the Windows build started generating compile errors in <code>stdlib</code> headers. I reverted back to the last build that compiled but the errors continued.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve got to assume something changed in the Azure Windows VM, but there was no mention of it.  Maybe it was just a temp glitch.</p>\n<p>I decided the time was right to get the game building on <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> if for nothing more than just having a backup.</p>\n<p>AppVeyor has some (how to I say this kindly) horrific documentation.</p>\n<p>It took me a day to cobble together snippets posted by others on the world wide web but it&rsquo;s finally working (now I just need to get Linux compiling).</p>\n<p>The good news is AppVeyor builds both platforms in around 5 mins (running 2 parallel jobs like Azure was).</p>\n<p>Big win over Azure.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is the Mac builds twice as fast as Windows.  I don&rsquo;t know if this is a Visual Studio vs. XCode thing or just the VMs they are running on.</p>\n<p>I thought I&rsquo;d post my <code>appveyor.yml</code> so others can benefit from my pain. I couldn&rsquo;t get <code>$(configuration)</code> (and the like) to work, so I ended by hand pasting values like <code>Release</code>.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a AppVeyor expert, I&rsquo;m open to suggests on making it better.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-yaml"><span style="display: flex;"><span><span style="color: #f92672;">version</span>: <span style="color: #ae81ff;">1.0</span><span style="color: #ae81ff;">.{build}</span>\n</span></span><span style="display: flex;"><span><span style="color: #f92672;">image</span>: \n</span></span><span style="display: flex;"><span>  -

OK, fine.</p>\n<p><code>local image = createTextImage(FONT_SYSTEM, &quot;Hello World&quot;, 48)</code></p>\n<p>There is a fairly high degree of technical and programming knowledge needed. I&rsquo;ve always skewed away from visual programming and dialogue engines. While they are great for beginners, getting real work done is problematic. Again, these are the real tools we used, not watered down &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; tools.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Git for 10+ years, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever had a public repo and had to deal with pull requests, etc. This will be a big learning curve for both of us.</p>\n<p>I generally won&rsquo;t be accepting pull requests just for modifications to the game unless they fix bugs related to getting this repo working. I might accept pull requests for documentation and new translations and if they are good they maybe-might be integrated into the shipping game.</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;But Ron, why won&rsquo;t you accept my bug fixes and improvements to the game?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Good question little Timmy&hellip; let&rsquo;s dive into that&hellip;</p>\n<p>A game that goes on Steam, Epic, or GOG requires a great deal of testing. Delores had/has two full-time paid testers and before any build was uploaded to a store, it got a good deal of testing around the fix, plus a complete play through of 30 photos was required on each platform. Each of the stores uses the same &ldquo;bits&rdquo;, but we still had to download each platform from each store and do a run through.</p>\n<p>And that was for an easy fix. If the fix was more involved or changed logic significantly it could require 20-40 hours of testing. If we broke a store build, it would be hours of tech support emails.</p>\n<p>I believe a lot in testing and testers and much of that came from my time at Lucasfilm and dealing with hard media. To even put a build of Monkey Island into test required over an hour of work as I made and verified 5+ floppies. Just rebuilding the SCUMM scripts to Monkey Island took over an hour (a job that takes a fraction of a second for Delores).</p>\n<p>Releasing a build going to manufacture was nerve wracking and very expensive. If you introduced a stupid bug, you&rsquo;d remake 200,000 floppies. While Monkey Island was in final testing, any change had to live in test for two weeks. If we found a bug and made a new build, we&rsquo;d reset the clock.</p>\n<p>Today it&rsquo;s easy. I start a shell script, wait 15 minutes for the CI machine to build the new engines and 5 seconds later it&rsquo;s on Steam and I can push the &ldquo;publish&rdquo; button. It&rsquo;s too easy.</p>\n<p>BONUS NOTE: Don&rsquo;t believe the myth that programmers can test their own code. They can&rsquo;t. Programmers will test for all the conditions they can imagine, but a good tester will imagine many many more and players will try things programmers never even considered. Knowledge of their code is the achilles heel of programmers. I&rsquo;ve had code I was 100% sure was rock solid, only to have one of our testers reduce me to tears. A good tester excels at poking your code in places you never considered. I&rsquo;m not talking about your unit tested sort routine, I&rsquo;m talking about complex puzzle logic and odd UI uses. It&rsquo;s the stuff unit tests will never catch, but a good tester will. Testers are the unsung heroes of your team, treat them very well.</p>\n<p>Every time you do a build, you also run the risk of accidentally introducing an error. Once I did a build from the wrong branch, everything looked fine but after a few bugs came in, I realized something was very wrong. I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t just build and hit &ldquo;publish&rdquo;. Even fixing a typo requires testing.</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Hey Ron, little Timmy again&hellip; why don&rsquo;t you release the source to the engine?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Another great question.</p>\n<p>Releasing the engine source (c++) is problematic for a few reasons. The first is that it uses a very large library of mine, most of which is not used in this engine, so I&rsquo;d have to go though and cull out all the cruft, not to mention all the proprietary console crap.  I also use some third party source I don&rsquo;t have the rights to release.  It&rsquo;s a big job and would split my main engine off from the released engine, which becomes a merge catastrophe (either that or a million #if&rsquo;s).</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Little Timmy again, I have a followup question&hellip; Why don&rsquo;t you license the executable for us to use in our shipping games?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Allowing others to release games using the engine is a support nightmare for me.   A game would be released and then customers would have issues, or it wouldn&rsquo;t work on specific hardware, and then I&rsquo;d be stuck (indirectly) supporting it.  I could charge money, but unless hundreds (if not thousands) of people licensed the engine, I fear the cost would be more than a game is likely to make.</p>\n<p>But the most important reason is that I like to make games and want to dedicate most of my time to making new ones, not supporting an engine.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve had a chance to look at all the source, I think you&rsquo;ll realize there is no &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; here.  It&rsquo;s just an adventure game engine. Why did I create a new one? Because I enjoy it.</p>\n<p>This post ended up being longer than I expected.  I hope you enjoy looking through my and David&rsquo;s crappy code. Happy modding.  I&rsquo;m excited to see what you do.</p>\n<p>(wait for laughter from todd)</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, the Delores source is intended solely for personal use to learn and explore. Please respect our choice to release the source by using it as intended.</p>\n<p>P.S. The dev engine has all the same limitations as the game, so Mac 10.10, Win 10 (dx12) and unfortunately (at this time) no Linux build. As soon as the Linux version is done, I will upload that as well. It might be a month, or months, or longer.</p>\n<p>P.P.S If you have questions or want to help others out, visit <a href="https://forums.thimbleweedpark.com/c/delores-engine/18">the Thimbleweed Park Forums</a></p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<p>Oh crap!</p>\n<p>I accidentally pushed the wrong button and made the <a href="https://github.com/grumpygamer/DeloresDev">Delores source code available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>I guess there is no putting Delores back in the bottle now&hellip;</p>\n<p>(wait for laughter)</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m only half kidding.</p>\n<p>(wait for Todd in the third row, who laughs at anything, to stop laughing)</p>\n<p>I did publish all the <a href="https://github.com/grumpygamer/DeloresDev">source code to Delores on GitHub</a>, but it wasn&rsquo;t an accident.

Again, these are the real tools we used, not watered down &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; tools.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Git for 10+ years, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever had a public repo and had to deal with pull requests, etc. This will be a big learning curve for both of us.</p>\n<p>I generally won&rsquo;t be accepting pull requests just for modifications to the game unless they fix bugs related to getting this repo working. I might accept pull requests for documentation and new translations and if they are good they maybe-might be integrated into the shipping game.</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;But Ron, why won&rsquo;t you accept my bug fixes and improvements to the game?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Good question little Timmy&hellip; let&rsquo;s dive into that&hellip;</p>\n<p>A game that goes on Steam, Epic, or GOG requires a great deal of testing. Delores had/has two full-time paid testers and before any build was uploaded to a store, it got a good deal of testing around the fix, plus a complete play through of 30 photos was required on each platform. Each of the stores uses the same &ldquo;bits&rdquo;, but we still had to download each platform from each store and do a run through.</p>\n<p>And that was for an easy fix. If the fix was more involved or changed logic significantly it could require 20-40 hours of testing. If we broke a store build, it would be hours of tech support emails.</p>\n<p>I believe a lot in testing and testers and much of that came from my time at Lucasfilm and dealing with hard media. To even put a build of Monkey Island into test required over an hour of work as I made and verified 5+ floppies. Just rebuilding the SCUMM scripts to Monkey Island took over an hour (a job that takes a fraction of a second for Delores).</p>\n<p>Releasing a build going to manufacture was nerve wracking and very expensive. If you introduced a stupid bug, you&rsquo;d remake 200,000 floppies. While Monkey Island was in final testing, any change had to live in test for two weeks. If we found a bug and made a new build, we&rsquo;d reset the clock.</p>\n<p>Today it&rsquo;s easy. I start a shell script, wait 15 minutes for the CI machine to build the new engines and 5 seconds later it&rsquo;s on Steam and I can push the &ldquo;publish&rdquo; button. It&rsquo;s too easy.</p>\n<p>BONUS NOTE: Don&rsquo;t believe the myth that programmers can test their own code. They can&rsquo;t. Programmers will test for all the conditions they can imagine, but a good tester will imagine many many more and players will try things programmers never even considered. Knowledge of their code is the achilles heel of programmers. I&rsquo;ve had code I was 100% sure was rock solid, only to have one of our testers reduce me to tears. A good tester excels at poking your code in places you never considered. I&rsquo;m not talking about your unit tested sort routine, I&rsquo;m talking about complex puzzle logic and odd UI uses. It&rsquo;s the stuff unit tests will never catch, but a good tester will. Testers are the unsung heroes of your team, treat them very well.</p>\n<p>Every time you do a build, you also run the risk of accidentally introducing an error. Once I did a build from the wrong branch, everything looked fine but after a few bugs came in, I realized something was very wrong. I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t just build and hit &ldquo;publish&rdquo;. Even fixing a typo requires testing.</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Hey Ron, little Timmy again&hellip; why don&rsquo;t you release the source to the engine?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Another great question.</p>\n<p>Releasing the engine source (c++) is problematic for a few reasons. The first is that it uses a very large library of mine, most of which is not used in this engine, so I&rsquo;d have to go though and cull out all the cruft, not to mention all the proprietary console crap.  I also use some third party source I don&rsquo;t have the rights to release.  It&rsquo;s a big job and would split my main engine off from the released engine, which becomes a merge catastrophe (either that or a million #if&rsquo;s).</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Little Timmy again, I have a followup question&hellip; Why don&rsquo;t you license the executable for us to use in our shipping games?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Allowing others to release games using the engine is a support nightmare for me.   A game would be released and then customers would have issues, or it wouldn&rsquo;t work on specific hardware, and then I&rsquo;d be stuck (indirectly) supporting it.  I could charge money, but unless hundreds (if not thousands) of people licensed the engine, I fear the cost would be more than a game is likely to make.</p>\n<p>But the most important reason is that I like to make games and want to dedicate most of my time to making new ones, not supporting an engine.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve had a chance to look at all the source, I think you&rsquo;ll realize there is no &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; here.  It&rsquo;s just an adventure game engine. Why did I create a new one? Because I enjoy it.</p>\n<p>This post ended up being longer than I expected.  I hope you enjoy looking through my and David&rsquo;s crappy code. Happy modding.  I&rsquo;m excited to see what you do.</p>\n<p>(wait for laughter from todd)</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, the Delores source is intended solely for personal use to learn and explore. Please respect our choice to release the source by using it as intended.</p>\n<p>P.S. The dev engine has all the same limitations as the game, so Mac 10.10, Win 10 (dx12) and unfortunately (at this time) no Linux build. As soon as the Linux version is done, I will upload that as well. It might be a month, or months, or longer.</p>\n<p>P.P.S If you have questions or want to help others out, visit <a href="https://forums.thimbleweedpark.com/c/delores-engine/18">the Thimbleweed Park Forums</a></p>'}}

That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing this blog entry.</p>\n<p>When the Thimbleweed Park engine got to the point where it could actually be used and David was brought on, I thought about CI. Previously I had used a dedicated machine in the office with <a href="https://jenkins.io/index.html">Jenkins</a> installed.  I only ever needed to make a Windows build (or builds that used VS) so it was one machine with a few different flavors of builds.</p>\n<p>For Thimbleweed Park I need to make Windows, Xbox, Mac, Android, IOS (and later Switch and PS4) and Linux builds.

As the end of the project rolled around it seemed pointless since the project was almost over.  Of course, I was wrong and we continued doing updates and ports for a year.</p>\n<p>At the time I was looking at CI, cloud-based services like <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a> either didn&rsquo;t exist or never showed up on Google searches.  Today you can just use these two cloud services to build Windows (or anything that needs VS), Mac (Mac and iOS) and Linux. Android can be built on any of them. If you don&rsquo;t mind waiting 10 or 15 minutes for the build to start, both services are very reasonable (and free for open source projects).</p>\n<p>In the end, I built the Windows, Mac and Linux builds on my local machine. I had the entire process scripted, so it was running a single bash script and all the Mac versions were built.  I ran a Windows VM on my Mac and would launch it was run a .bat file to built all the Windows flavors.   Same with Linux, boot the VM and do the builds.</p>\n<p>Thimbleweed Park was a tad complex because there were two parts that had to be rebuilt (the engine and the game), and while intertwined, they were separate and it was common for one to be rebuilt and the other not.  It was also complicated by all the game build tools being on the Mac, so you couldn&rsquo;t actually build the game code on Windows. This didn&rsquo;t matter since the game code/files were 100% cross-platform. I could build them on the Mac and they would run on Windows, PS4, Switch, etc.</p>\n<p>It makes CI a little more complex because your CI might be building the engine but something had to merge it all together (another CI process).  The game code needs to be built first (and you don&rsquo;t need to rebuild it for each platform), then the engine process could grab it and merge it, or a third process could combine it all, but everyone would have to know when each piece was done (if a new build was needed). My point isn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s impossible, just that it&rsquo;s hard and a problem that I ultimately (and unfortunately) didn&rsquo;t need to solve.</p>\n<p>Back when the project started, if I had known about <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a>, I would have set them up and ultimately saved me a lot of time and stress.</p>\n<p>Next time for sure!!!</p>\n<p>No, really, next time for sure.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ci.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Last month (maybe longer) I wrote about one of the top three production mistakes we made in Thimbleweed Park.

I ran a Windows VM on my Mac and would launch it was run a .bat file to built all the Windows flavors.   Same with Linux, boot the VM and do the builds.</p>\n<p>Thimbleweed Park was a tad complex because there were two parts that had to be rebuilt (the engine and the game), and while intertwined, they were separate and it was common for one to be rebuilt and the other not.  It was also complicated by all the game build tools being on the Mac, so you couldn&rsquo;t actually build the game code on Windows. This didn&rsquo;t matter since the game code/files were 100% cross-platform. I could build them on the Mac and they would run on Windows, PS4, Switch, etc.</p>\n<p>It makes CI a little more complex because your CI might be building the engine but something had to merge it all together (another CI process).  The game code needs to be built first (and you don&rsquo;t need to rebuild it for each platform), then the engine process could grab it and merge it, or a third process could combine it all, but everyone would have to know when each piece was done (if a new build was needed). My point isn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s impossible, just that it&rsquo;s hard and a problem that I ultimately (and unfortunately) didn&rsquo;t need to solve.</p>\n<p>Back when the project started, if I had known about <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a>, I would have set them up and ultimately saved me a lot of time and stress.</p>\n<p>Next time for sure!!!</p>\n<p>No, really, next time for sure.</p>'}}

How you divide your time between making games and living &ldquo;real life&rdquo; ?</strong></p>\n<p>I work on a Mac exclusively. When I need to compile a Windows or Linux build, I start up a VM. I can&rsquo;t listen to music while I program, I need complete quiet. When I write, music is helpful. Dividing my life between making games and real life is a struggle. I need to leave the house to fully disconnect. In the winters, I go skiing. I&rsquo;m off skiing today.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Giorgio Novelli: Why did you leave Lucasfilm? I never found a satisfying answer on the internet and it still kind of haunts and confuses me.</strong></p>\n<p>I had worked at Lucasfilm for 8 years and learned a lot, not just about game design and programming, but also marketing, PR, and production and I felt like I needed to try it all for myself. I also had the idea of making adventure games for kids. I floated it by Lucasfilm Games and they weren&rsquo;t interested. It feels like the confusing thing for a lot of people about me leaving comes from them thinking I was leaving an amazingly successful franchise and why would I do that? That&rsquo;s because, at the time, Monkey Island wasn&rsquo;t. It sold well, but not amazingly well. Sierra Online was selling 10x the copies we were and it&rsquo;s was only 20 years later that Monkey Island has taken on this almost mythic nature in people&rsquo;s memories. That wasn&rsquo;t true back then.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>** PiecesOfKate: Considering the potential benefits of social media (such as Twitter) for promoting a game, versus your personal dislike of those channels - if you were to make another game would you rejoin, or avoid it?

If I was just releasing a new game, I don&rsquo;t think I would need to come back, but if I was doing a Kickstarter, it would be really hard to not leverage social media.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Gustavo: Hi Ron. I have always wondered about the &ldquo;Extra 5 USD for Guilt Absolution&rdquo; tier on the Kickstarter campaign that I and 3047 other people choose. Where did that idea come from? Did you expect to have so many people voluntarily choose to pay 5 USD more than the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; tier?</strong></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t remember who came up with this, but we knew it was going to be popular, and if not popular, then funny.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Nathan: Given the engine and assets of TWP, would a sequel be significantly cheaper / quicker to produce?</strong></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think it would. The engine didn&rsquo;t add that much to the development time and cost. Maybe 20%, but saving 20% isn&rsquo;t significant and that savings would get eaten up in engine enhancements and me wanting to do more artistically with the presentation. Holding true to the spirit of Maniac Mansion (dollhouse view, no close-ups or cinematic presentation (think about the difference between Maniac Mansion and DotT)) saved us a lot. We could make a new game cheaper if it had the same look and feel, but that isn&rsquo;t creatively interesting for me. If I do another point-and-click, I want to push what a point-and-click can be, but still staying true to the form.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>LostTrainDude: Where do you think improvement and evolution lie in the future of adventure games, considering their heavily-scripted nature? Is it in technology or in better design? What is it that you would like to see in an adventure game and didn&rsquo;t yet? This discussion rises from my curiosity in Chris Crawford&rsquo;s work on Interactive Storytelling (which you may be familiar with as well).</strong></p>\n<p>The future of interactive narrative is in true AI. I don&rsquo;t think AI will ever be able to tell compelling stories on its own (stories are compelling because they are soulful depictions of the human experience), but there is so much &ldquo;filling&rdquo; that goes on in an interactive story that AI would be perfect for.

The whole story is about it&rsquo;s medium and just telling you about it (in novel form) removes you from the whole point. I&rsquo;m fine with fan fiction and long as it stays &ldquo;fan&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not so much about making money as not turning it into an industry. There is a lot of Thimbleweed Park fan art (and even people selling it), and I don&rsquo;t have a problem as long as 1) You can&rsquo;t use our trademarks, 2) it&rsquo;s not confused with official/licensed merchandise, 3) you&rsquo;re not making too much.

Thimbleweed Park was probably the better for it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Erik: Would you consider going back in the direction of Humongous Entertainment by creating games that are solely aimed at kids rather than &ldquo;grown ups&rdquo;? Do you ever think about that segment of games?</strong></p>\n<p>The kids market has changed a lot in the last 15 years and I don&rsquo;t find it interesting anymore. It&rsquo;s all about licensed games, quick disposable mobile games, or these odd social website type games. What I loved about making games at Humongous Entertainment was telling stories as adventure games. I don&rsquo;t think there is a big market for that anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Dryade: If you never manage to make Monkey Island 3, which would be a tragedy, will you divulge the secret of Monkey Island or will it just vanish with you and keep us all forever in anguish?</strong></p>\n<p>Here is the deal with the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of Monkey Island: It&rsquo;s just not that interesting now (it was back then). But over the last 25 years, it&rsquo;s grown to almost mythic proportions. If I told you the secret, you&rsquo;d go &ldquo;Oh&hellip; that&rsquo;s kind of dumb&rdquo;. If I was ever to do Monkey Island 3a, the trick would be to take the core of the secret and build it into something that lived up to the hype. I would never create a new or different secret (that&rsquo;s unfair), rather, it would be about making it more meaningful, relevant, and build on the mythology. I have an idea on how to do that, but it&rsquo;s not fully formed and sorry to disappoint everyone, but I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time thinking about it these days.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lancelot&rsquo;s Hangover: After beta testing, what do you do if you realize a series of puzzles doesn&rsquo;t work. Do you cut off the whole series of the puzzles (meaning wasting time/art/effort)?  Do you try to make those puzzles easier by giving more explicit hints through dialogs and hotspot/object descriptions? Do you keep most art and animations but rebuild the whole series of puzzle in a different way?</strong></p>\n<p>I assume you mean &ldquo;playtesting&rdquo; since we don&rsquo;t do beta testing.  But, at any point in development, from playtesters, bug testers, or us playing the game, we&rsquo;re constantly finding puzzles that don&rsquo;t work. That&rsquo;s a normal part of the design process. Most of the time it&rsquo;s a simple tweak like adding or changing a line of dialog or moving a clue. Other times we&rsquo;ve had to take the entire puzzle chain and move it to a different part of the game (we did this with the Pigeons in Thimbleweed Park) and this can involve doing new art or animation. There are other times where the core of the puzzle just doesn&rsquo;t work, so you just cut it and never look back. Ideally, your production process is such that most of this happens when you&rsquo;re still in a pre-production and making large changes doesn&rsquo;t cost that much, but occasionally, you&rsquo;re making big puzzle edits late in the process and you just take the hit. I&rsquo;d rather throw out good work than leave it in and diminish the experience.

I might do a bonus post on Wednesday answering some of the ones I couldn&rsquo;t get to, and of course, there is next week to eagerly look forward to.  Let&rsquo;s get going&hellip;</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with Octavi. I wonder where I know that name from?</p>\n<p><strong>Octavi: When making any kind of artistic work we know there&rsquo;s always a disappointingly huge difference between our first idea and the end result: which one of your games you&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the most faithful to your original vision?</strong></p>\n<p>None of them.  I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before, but the creative process is a messy process and everything I&rsquo;ve done has changed significantly from idea to finished game. I can&rsquo;t think of an idea that ended up being something horribly distorted from my original idea (or maybe I just blocked it out). I don&rsquo;t tend to work with publishers, so I&rsquo;ve never had a 3rd party come in and take my idea in a direction I disagreed with. The important lesson for anyone making something is: don&rsquo;t be afraid to let your idea evolve during production, even radically. There is no prize for stubbornly sticking to your vision.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Romulus: When deciding on 2D vs 3D was money the only factor? We all know 3D sucks eh? Also, how you decided what were the components required on the engine? Based on your previous scumm experience?</strong></p>\n<p>To start off, I don&rsquo;t dislike 3D, it&rsquo;s just not something I have the skill set to do at a reasonable level of quality.  3D is more expensive, but it&rsquo;s not massively more expensive if you make good tech and artistic choices. I&rsquo;d love to make a true point-and-click adventure in real 3D (not that fake 2D/3D). I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s done it well yet, and it would be a fascinating challenge.  But my tech skills are in 2D, so I would need to partner up with someone who had good 3D chops. The problem is finding that person. They need to share a vision and passion with me and not just be a work-for-hire gig.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Jensan: Could you see yourself coding a C64 game from scratch in 2018? If so, what type of game?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh god no! Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love the C64, but I&rsquo;m too used to modern tools and platforms. Only 2G of free RAM! WTF!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Kim Jørgensen: What was the best and worst design decision for TWP?</strong></p>\n<p>Best: Having a hard and easy mode. When I did it for Monkey Island 2, it was more of a joke than anything else, but in today&rsquo;s more casual/grown-up world, I think it was greatly appreciated by a lot of players with less time than they had as kids.</p>\n<p>Worst: I wish we would have had custom responses for every verb and object in the first few rooms of the game. Players were just getting used to the interface and mechanic and default responses threw people off sometimes. We couldn&rsquo;t realistically do this for the entire game, but we could have done a better job of setting the mood without misleading expectations.</p>\n<p>Bonus: Not shipping with a hint system. We fixed this in an update, but it should have been part of the release. I fought against it for most of the project, and I was wrong.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Yrface: If you were to punish a visitor for unauthorized copyright infringement of your website, how/who would administer the punishment?</strong></p>\n<p>Me. Human dismemberment is a hobby of mine.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Jon N/A: Hey Ron. There used to be posts here - &ldquo;excerpts&rdquo; from a novel you have <em>not</em> been writing. I loved those! I found them hilarious and very inventive. Would you put them back up again? And better yet, write more of those?</strong></p>\n<p>Those were part of a daily writing exercise I used to do in the mornings. I would sit down with a pad and paper and just start writing, never pausing and never thinking about any direction.  I&rsquo;d then go through and grab a sentence or two that I liked. I stopped doing the writing exercise and they never got moved to Grumpy Gamer v2.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll go find them and do a single anthology post.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Paul: What is Ron Gilbert&rsquo;s ultimate goal in the gaming industry? Eg: To make a big popular game and then be able to make whatever you want off the back of it? Continually make great games for a loyal smaller audience (eg. PnC fans) within budget and with reasonably healthy profit on each? Branch out and make games in different genres? Build Terrible Toybox further and make it a main game studio? Put out artistic games that push boundaries, but don&rsquo;t necessarily find a large audience?</strong></p>\n<p>Holy crap is this is a deep minefield of a question. Why do we do what we do? Doing any commercial creative venture is done for one of five reasons. 1) To make money, 2) Critical acclaim, 3) Peer approval, 4) Personal fulfillment, 5) Player enjoyment (or any combination of those). At a core level, why do I make games? If I was going to be honest, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s 4, 5 and 3, but I need 1 due to not being independently wealthy. Thimbleweed Park did 4 and 5, didn&rsquo;t really do 3 and did 1, but only at a breakeven level.  You can&rsquo;t run a risky business like making games at breakeven. No matter how good you are, you will have failures and you need to make enough to endure those without destroying the company and yourself. Part of 3 is making something that your peers and the industry take notice of, something that &ldquo;moves the meter&rdquo;.  Doing point-and-click adventures at breakeven doesn&rsquo;t do that, and I think that&rsquo;s always been a motivator of mine. This is an honest answer that it&rsquo;s easy to read too much into, so don&rsquo;t do that.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>uriel: From what I read is my understanding that Thimbleweed Park sold fine but it was not a resounding success. Do you think a bigger marketing campaign would have increased revenue to the point of making enough money to fully fund the next game? I guess I&rsquo;m wondering how much do you think marketing can influence the success of a game. Thanks for doing this btw.</strong></p>\n<p>I think it&rsquo;s fairer to say Thimbleweed Park &ldquo;sold well&rdquo;. I had a range of what I thought would be acceptable and sales were towards the bottom, but not below. I don&rsquo;t think more marketing would have helped. We had good (even great) PR and we got picked up by all the major publications, so I don&rsquo;t know if there was anything more we could have done. I think there were three core issues with Thimbleweed Park:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Point-and-click has a huge stigma attached to it and I vastly underestimated that. I figured that if you designed a really good point-and-click game, people would respond. And that is partly true. For the people who took the plunge and played it, they were pleasantly (and often overwhelmingly) surprised. But, too many other people (and a fair number of industry people) just wrote it off.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Influencers (press and widely known devs) in the industry are craving deep, meaningful and grown-up narrative games, and they will latch onto games that even hint at that, even if they do a crappy job at it. Thimbleweed Park is not that game. Thimbleweed Park is the best Scooby Doo story you&rsquo;ve ever played and doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be a deep soul searching reflection for the player.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We struggled with what was needed to do a successful Kickstarter and what&rsquo;s needed to release a successful game.  Doing the Maniac Mansion art style and layout was key to invoking the right nostalgia and ending with a highly successful Kickstarter, but some of those choices also limited its &ldquo;market success&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m very proud that we delivered on what we promised for the Kickstarter. We talked about dropping the verbs and dropping the dollhouse Maniac Mansion layout but ultimately decided not to in favor of being true to the campaign. In the end, maybe we made the wrong &ldquo;business&rdquo; decision, but I feel we made the right &ldquo;personal creative&rdquo; decision and I don&rsquo;t regret it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Or&hellip; maybe we didn&rsquo;t make a very compelling and interesting game. You always have to consider that.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Sushi Will we ever see a Terrible Toybox logo? If not, why not. If so, when? If maybe, just improvise something funny.</strong></p>\n<p>Not knowing if this would be a one-game company (still not sure about that), we decided to focus all our branding on Thimbleweed Park and not Terrible Toybox.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lancelot&rsquo;s Hangover: Hey Ron! In the TWP podcasts, you talked about the importance of the &ldquo;sense of space&rdquo; in adventure games and its importance for immersion. Could you tell more about it? Could you give practical details on how you can add more sense of space within games? Could be useful for adventure game designers.</strong></p>\n<p>The number one rule for creating a sense of space is: Don&rsquo;t teleport the player around. Let people explore the world and create an internal map of the space in their head.  Even something like &ldquo;fast travel&rdquo; can destroy a sense of place. Don&rsquo;t jump players inside a building without letting them discover the outside and where it exists in the world. In Thimbleweed Park, you had to walk/run around the world for a good ¼ of the game before we introduced fast-travel with the maps. Often players will just want to jump around the world, avoiding &ldquo;pointless travel&rdquo;, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s pointless. It&rsquo;s an important part of that sense of space that makes the world and game more enjoyable.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Antony: How do you justify the lack of support of Android on your game Scurvy Scallywags while complaining about the lack of macOS support on Steam games?</strong></p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a fair question and I assume it&rsquo;s in <a href="https://grumpygamer.com/1728dad57df92e42389a28c">response to this.</a> I think it&rsquo;s different for a couple of reasons and I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people&rsquo;s perspectives will be different. I didn&rsquo;t mean to criticize other indie devs, I know building multiple platforms is hard. To me, Mac and Windows are 99% the same. Building for Mac after Window just isn&rsquo;t that hard, just don&rsquo;t litter your code with dx calls. Also, maybe I&rsquo;ve gotten spoiled due to Unity projects being super simple to release on Mac, so we&rsquo;re seeing a lot more of them. Also, we did build Scurvy for Android. It was a complete flop and made a few thousand dollars, despite costing us tens of thousands of dollars. Google changed some part of the OS and the game started crashing, so we removed it from the store. It just wasn&rsquo;t worth the time to go in an fix it given it was making around a dollar a week. iOS, on the other hand, continued to make money and porting up to iOS 11 made sense. I also think (as Mac user), there is a bigger sting due to Steam being a single store that sells Windows and Mac platforms.  If there was a Windows store and a completely separate Mac store (like iOS and Android), I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have the same negative feelings. In the end, it probably was a little unfair to the devs of Cogmind, but I just really wanted to play their game. But point taken.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it for this week. If you have any questions for next week, put them in the comments. I&rsquo;ll try and answer different types of questions each week so they aren&rsquo;t all questions about Thimbleweed Park or my old games. If you ask a question for next week, please start it with Q: so I can quickly filter them.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/friday_questions_c.png" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of good questions this week, I&rsquo;ll chock that up to being the first week.

I also think (as Mac user), there is a bigger sting due to Steam being a single store that sells Windows and Mac platforms.  If there was a Windows store and a completely separate Mac store (like iOS and Android), I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have the same negative feelings. In the end, it probably was a little unfair to the devs of Cogmind, but I just really wanted to play their game. But point taken.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it for this week. If you have any questions for next week, put them in the comments. I&rsquo;ll try and answer different types of questions each week so they aren&rsquo;t all questions about Thimbleweed Park or my old games. If you ask a question for next week, please start it with Q: so I can quickly filter them.</p>'}}

We had a problem on the PS4 where savegame data would get corrupt due to threading. We could have built a stress tester for this, but that&rsquo;s all 20/20 hindsight. I can think of 100 other places that worked fine and without that hindsight, we would have spent a lot of time writing stress testers.</p>\n<p>Again, not impossible, just not economical.</p>\n<p>But maybe I&rsquo;m wrong. Maybe other game developers have amazing game unit tests that are enormous time and money savers. If that&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;d love to hear about them. I&rsquo;m basically lazy and more than happy for robots to do my work.</p>\n<p>But it feels like the ability to unit test games would require a good AI that can spot perceptual issues that go way beyond just getting bad data out of a function. Or maybe that&rsquo;s called Early Access.</p>'}}

Moon bases and rocket ships. It didn&rsquo;t quite turn out the way 8-year-old Ronnie imagined. Some ways better. Some ways worse. I&rsquo;m not sure my life turned out the way I imagined. Some ways better some. Some ways worse.</p>\n<p>2017 was the year Thimbleweed Park came out. It was also the year a dipshit narcissistic asshole became president.  I would gladly trade Thimbleweed Park for a mentally stable president. And so should you.</p>\n<p>But enough reminiscing and fostering armed rebellion&hellip; it&rsquo;s on to 2018.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never been the kind of person that does New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions. Like 99% of all people, I just forget about them a month later and have now decided to be honest with myself and stop making them.  So let&rsquo;s call these &ldquo;goals&rdquo; for 2018. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that these are just my professional and career goals. My personal goals are another whole can of worms that I won&rsquo;t be sharing on the damn internet.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get going&hellip;</p>\n<h3 id="play-more-games"><strong>Play more games</strong></h3>\n<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t say enough about this one. I hardly play any video games. 2016-2017 were busy years for me, but deep down I know that is just an excuse. At the end of the workday, I&rsquo;m burnt out and I just don&rsquo;t want to play games, they always feel more like work than relaxation. It&rsquo;s also really hard for me to play a game without deconstructing it and that saps a lot of the enjoyment away.</p>\n<p>I did play Golf Story for many many hours until rage quitting (more on that in a future post).  I quite enjoyed West of Loathing as well (no rage quitting). But besides a few mobile games to waste some time, I didn&rsquo;t really play anything else.</p>\n<p>I hear from friends about all the games they played and I wonder &ldquo;where do you find all the time?&rdquo;  Well, all that is going to change in 2018, and now that my blog is fully operational, I hope to write about what I&rsquo;m playing. And I promise not to just bitch about them.</p>\n<p>Then again&hellip; maybe I don&rsquo;t enjoy playing games. That&rsquo;s a terrifying thought.</p>\n<h3 id="do-a-twitch-steam"><strong>Do a Twitch steam</strong></h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do this. I doubt it will be a gameplay stream, I am way too quiet when playing games. When I watch Streamers, I marvel at how they can talk non-stop while playing. When I play games, I get very quiet and contemplative. I don&rsquo;t tend to &ldquo;think out loud.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What I&rsquo;d like to do is a programming Stream. I joked about adding floppy disk sounds to Thimbleweed Park when it&rsquo;s loading data, so my goal is to stream me implementing that.  Streaming from a Mac is a little harder, but I&rsquo;m sure I can figure it out.</p>\n<h3 id="give-a-talk"><strong>Give a talk</strong></h3>\n<p>I really hate giving talks. It&rsquo;s not stage fright, it&rsquo;s more that I over prepare and end up spending months writing the talk and stressing about it. It&rsquo;s just not a good use of my time, so I tend to avoid it.</p>\n<p>Also, when most people ask me to talk, it usually about Monkey Island or some retro topic. I really don&rsquo;t want to only be known as &ldquo;the guy that created Monkey Island and made point-and-click games&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s all anyone wants to hear me talk about. It would depress me greatly if that was actually the truth.</p>\n<p>So my 2018 goal is to give a talk about a non-monkey-island-point-and-click topic. I have a talk in my head called <strong>&ldquo;10 things I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</strong>  I think I&rsquo;ll give that one. Or maybe <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not imposter syndrome, you actually suck at your job.&rdquo;</strong> Then there is &ldquo;<strong>Don&rsquo;t get cocky kid, it&rsquo;s mostly luck</strong>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I refuse to give a talk about Thimbleweed Park unless it&rsquo;s <strong>&ldquo;Everything we fucked up in Thimbleweed Park.&rdquo;</strong> I&rsquo;m sick and tired of survivor bias talks. GDC is filled with them.</p>\n<p>OK, fine, this is why people only ask me to talk about Monkey Island.</p>\n<h3 id="blog-often-and-stay-off-twitter"><strong>Blog often and stay off Twitter</strong></h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been over a month since I&rsquo;ve been on Twitter and it&rsquo;s been great. I highly recommend it.  Like shedding any addiction, the first few weeks are hard, then it gets harder, then it gets better. Getting the Grumpy Gamer blog back up and running has been very therapeutic.</p>\n<p>Being able to write about something in other than 140 (now 280) character angry shouts has been nice and I plan on doing a lot more long-form writing in 2018. Currently, hardly anyone comes here, so it might take some time to build back an audience and convince the kids that the entire internet isn&rsquo;t just Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</p>\n<p>Please pass the word and share any good posts.  I might end up writing a Twitter bot that just posts links to my blog when it updates (that will reach a hell of a lot more people than RSS).</p>\n<h3 id="start-working-on-a-game"><strong>Start working on a game</strong></h3>\n<p>To be clear, my goal in 2018 is to start working on a game that will eventually ship. I am working on fun/relaxing prototypes that are helping to solidify various ideas in my head, but I doubt any of them will ever be finished. Thimbleweed Park was a huge grind and it&rsquo;s going to take me a while to come down from that.</p>\n<p>This new game doesn&rsquo;t have to be my own game. Finding a small group in Seattle that could use my talents would also be fun. Working with other people in the same physical location would be a gust of fresh air.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d Kickstart a new game either. Kickstarter was fun, but it&rsquo;s also feeding the hype/narcissism train like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It almost demands it and one could say that it&rsquo;s good for promotion, and that&rsquo;s hard to argue with, but it can make you do crazy/stupid/unproductive things.

They reached their full potential during Monkey Island where I relied on them for every aspect of the puzzle design.</p>\n<p>A Puzzle Dependency Chart is a list of all the puzzles and steps for solving a puzzle in an adventure game. They are presented in the form of a Graph with each node connecting to the puzzle or puzzle steps that are need to get there.  They do not generally include story beats unless they are critical to solving a puzzle.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s build one!</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_1.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I always work backwards when designing an adventure game, not from the very end of the game, but from the end of puzzle chains.  I usually start with &ldquo;The player needs to get into the basement&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Where should I hide a key to get into some place I haven&rsquo;t figured out yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I also like to work from left to right, other people like going top to bottom. My rational for left to right is I like to put them up on my office wall, wrapping the room with the game design.</p>\n<p>So&hellip; first, we&rsquo;ll need figure out what you need to get into the basement&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_2.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>And we then draw a line connecting the two, showing the dependency. &ldquo;Unlocking the door&rdquo; is dependent on &ldquo;Finding the Key&rdquo;.  Again, it&rsquo;s not flow, it&rsquo;s dependency.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s add a new step to the puzzle called &ldquo;Oil Hinges&rdquo; on the door and it can happen in parallel to the &ldquo;Finding the Key&rdquo; puzzle&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_3.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>We add two new puzzle nodes, one for the action &ldquo;Oil Hinges&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s dependency &ldquo;Find Oil Can&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Unlocking&rdquo; the door is not dependent on &ldquo;Oiling&rdquo; the hinges, so there is no connection. They do connect into &ldquo;Opening&rdquo; the basement door since they both need to be done.</p>\n<p>At this point, the chart is starting to get interesting and is showing us something important: The non-linearity of the design. There are two puzzles the player can be working on while trying to get the basement door open.</p>\n<p>There is nothing (NOTHING!) worse than linear adventure games and these charts are a quick visual way to see where the design gets too linear or too unwieldy with choice (also bad).</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s build it back a little more&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_6.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>When you step back and look at a finished Puzzle Dependency Chart, you should this kind of overall pattern with a lot of little sub-diamond shaped expansion and contraction of puzzles.  Solving one puzzle should open up 2 or 3 new ones, and then those collapses down (but not necessarily at the same rate) to a single solution that then opens up more non-linear puzzles.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_7.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The game starts out with a simple choice, then the puzzles begin to expand out with more and more for the player to be doing in parallel, then collapse back in.</p>\n<p>I tend to design adventures games in &ldquo;acts&rdquo;, where each act ends with a bottle neck to the next act. I like doing this because it gives players a sense of completion, and they can also file a bunch of knowledge away and (if need) the inventory can be culled).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_5.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Monkey Island would have looked something like this&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_4.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have the Puzzle Dependency Chart for Monkey Island, or I&rsquo;d post it. I&rsquo;ve seen some online, but they are more &ldquo;flowcharts&rdquo; and not &ldquo;dependency charts&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve had countless arguments with people over the differences and how dependency charts are not flowcharts, bla bla bla. They&rsquo;re not. I don&rsquo;t completely know why, but they are different.</p>\n<p>Flowcharts are great if you&rsquo;re trying to solve a game, dependency charts are great if you&rsquo;re trying to design a game. That&rsquo;s the best I can come up with.</p>\n<p>Here is a page from my MI design notebook that shows a puzzle in the process of being created using Puzzle Dependency Charts. It&rsquo;s the only way I know how to design an adventure game. I&rsquo;d be lost without them.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/MI2_puzzle1_small.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, how do you make these charts?</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need some software that automatically rebuilds the charts as you connect nodes. If you try and make these using a flowchart program, you&rsquo;ll spend forever reordering the boxes and making sure lines don&rsquo;t cross. It&rsquo;s a frustrating and time consuming process and it gets in the way of using these as a quick tool for design.</p>\n<p>Back at Lucasfilm Games, we used some software meant for project scheduling. I don&rsquo;t remember the name of it, and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s long gone.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve only modern program that does this well is <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">OmniGraffle</a>, but it only runs on the Mac. I&rsquo;m sure there are others, but since OmniGraffle does exactly what I need, I haven&rsquo;t look much deeper. I&rsquo;m sure there are others.</p>\n<p>OmniGraffle is built on top of the unix tool called <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a>. Graphviz is great, but you have to feed everything in as a text file. It&rsquo;s a nerd level 8 program, but it&rsquo;s what I used for DeathSpank.</p>\n<p>You can take a look at the <a href="https://grumpygamer.com/deathspank_pdc_image">DeathSpank Puzzle Dependency Chart here</a>, but I warn you, it&rsquo;s a big image, so get ready to zoom-n-scroll™.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this was interesting.

They do not generally include story beats unless they are critical to solving a puzzle.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s build one!</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_1.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I always work backwards when designing an adventure game, not from the very end of the game, but from the end of puzzle chains.  I usually start with &ldquo;The player needs to get into the basement&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Where should I hide a key to get into some place I haven&rsquo;t figured out yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I also like to work from left to right, other people like going top to bottom. My rational for left to right is I like to put them up on my office wall, wrapping the room with the game design.</p>\n<p>So&hellip; first, we&rsquo;ll need figure out what you need to get into the basement&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_2.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>And we then draw a line connecting the two, showing the dependency. &ldquo;Unlocking the door&rdquo; is dependent on &ldquo;Finding the Key&rdquo;.  Again, it&rsquo;s not flow, it&rsquo;s dependency.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s add a new step to the puzzle called &ldquo;Oil Hinges&rdquo; on the door and it can happen in parallel to the &ldquo;Finding the Key&rdquo; puzzle&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_3.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>We add two new puzzle nodes, one for the action &ldquo;Oil Hinges&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s dependency &ldquo;Find Oil Can&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Unlocking&rdquo; the door is not dependent on &ldquo;Oiling&rdquo; the hinges, so there is no connection. They do connect into &ldquo;Opening&rdquo; the basement door since they both need to be done.</p>\n<p>At this point, the chart is starting to get interesting and is showing us something important: The non-linearity of the design. There are two puzzles the player can be working on while trying to get the basement door open.</p>\n<p>There is nothing (NOTHING!) worse than linear adventure games and these charts are a quick visual way to see where the design gets too linear or too unwieldy with choice (also bad).</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s build it back a little more&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_6.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>When you step back and look at a finished Puzzle Dependency Chart, you should this kind of overall pattern with a lot of little sub-diamond shaped expansion and contraction of puzzles.  Solving one puzzle should open up 2 or 3 new ones, and then those collapses down (but not necessarily at the same rate) to a single solution that then opens up more non-linear puzzles.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_7.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The game starts out with a simple choice, then the puzzles begin to expand out with more and more for the player to be doing in parallel, then collapse back in.</p>\n<p>I tend to design adventures games in &ldquo;acts&rdquo;, where each act ends with a bottle neck to the next act. I like doing this because it gives players a sense of completion, and they can also file a bunch of knowledge away and (if need) the inventory can be culled).</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_5.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Monkey Island would have looked something like this&hellip;</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gg_pdc_4.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have the Puzzle Dependency Chart for Monkey Island, or I&rsquo;d post it. I&rsquo;ve seen some online, but they are more &ldquo;flowcharts&rdquo; and not &ldquo;dependency charts&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve had countless arguments with people over the differences and how dependency charts are not flowcharts, bla bla bla. They&rsquo;re not. I don&rsquo;t completely know why, but they are different.</p>\n<p>Flowcharts are great if you&rsquo;re trying to solve a game, dependency charts are great if you&rsquo;re trying to design a game. That&rsquo;s the best I can come up with.</p>\n<p>Here is a page from my MI design notebook that shows a puzzle in the process of being created using Puzzle Dependency Charts. It&rsquo;s the only way I know how to design an adventure game. I&rsquo;d be lost without them.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/MI2_puzzle1_small.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, how do you make these charts?</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need some software that automatically rebuilds the charts as you connect nodes. If you try and make these using a flowchart program, you&rsquo;ll spend forever reordering the boxes and making sure lines don&rsquo;t cross. It&rsquo;s a frustrating and time consuming process and it gets in the way of using these as a quick tool for design.</p>\n<p>Back at Lucasfilm Games, we used some software meant for project scheduling. I don&rsquo;t remember the name of it, and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s long gone.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve only modern program that does this well is <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">OmniGraffle</a>, but it only runs on the Mac. I&rsquo;m sure there are others, but since OmniGraffle does exactly what I need, I haven&rsquo;t look much deeper. I&rsquo;m sure there are others.</p>\n<p>OmniGraffle is built on top of the unix tool called <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a>. Graphviz is great, but you have to feed everything in as a text file. It&rsquo;s a nerd level 8 program, but it&rsquo;s what I used for DeathSpank.</p>\n<p>You can take a look at the <a href="https://grumpygamer.com/deathspank_pdc_image">DeathSpank Puzzle Dependency Chart here</a>, but I warn you, it&rsquo;s a big image, so get ready to zoom-n-scroll™.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this was interesting. I could spend all day long talking about Puzzle Dependency Charts. Yea, I&rsquo;m a lot of fun on a first date.</p>'}}

I hear devs who call themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo; roll their eyes at other devs who call themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo; because they &ldquo;clearly they aren&rsquo;t indie&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>So what makes an indie developer &ldquo;indie&rdquo;?  Let&rsquo;s look at the word.</p>\n<p>The word &ldquo;indie&rdquo; comes from (I assume) the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  I guess the first question we have to ask is: independent from what? I think most people would say &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Yet, I know of several devs who proudly call themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo; when they are taking money from publishers (and big publishers at that) and other devs that would sneer at a dev taking publisher money and calling themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>What about taking money from investors? If you take money are you not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? What about money from friends or family? Or does it have to be VCs for you to lose &ldquo;indie&rdquo; status?</p>\n<p>What about Kickstarter?  I guess it&rsquo;s OK for indies to take money from Kickstarter. But are you really &ldquo;independent&rdquo;?  3,000 backers who now feel a sense of entitlement might disagree. Devs who feel an intense sense of pressure from backers might also disagree.</p>\n<p>Does being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; mean your idea is independent from mainstream thinking? Is being an &ldquo;indie developer&rdquo; just the new Punk Rock.</p>\n<p>Does the type of game you&rsquo;re making define you as &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? If a dev is making a metrics driven F2P game, but they are doing it independent of a publisher, does that mean they are not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;?</p>\n<p>This is one of the biggest areas I see &ldquo;indie&rdquo; snobbery kick in.  Snobby &ldquo;indie&rdquo; devs will look at an idea and proclaim it &ldquo;not indie&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Do &ldquo;indie&rdquo; games have to be quirky and weird? Do &ldquo;indie&rdquo; games have to be about the &ldquo;art&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>What about the dev? Does that matter? Someone once told me I was not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; because I have an established name, despite the fact that the games I&rsquo;m currently working on have taken no money from investors or publishers and are made by three people.</p>\n<p>What if the game is hugely successful and makes a ton of money? Does that make it not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; anymore? Is being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; about being scrappy and clawing your way from nothing? Once you have success, are you no longer &ldquo;indie&rdquo;?  Is it like being an &ldquo;indie band&rdquo; where once they gain success, they are looked down on by the fans? Does success mean selling-out? Does selling-out revoke your &ldquo;indie dev&rdquo; card?</p>\n<p>What if the &ldquo;indie&rdquo; developer already has lots of money? Does having millions of dollars make them not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? What if they made the money before they went &ldquo;indie&rdquo; or even before they started making games or if they have a rich (dead) aunt? Does &ldquo;indie&rdquo; mean you have to starve?</p>\n<p>Is it OK for an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; to hire top notch marketing and PR people? Or do &ldquo;indies&rdquo; have to scrape everything together themselves and use the grassroot network?</p>\n<p>Or does &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just mean you&rsquo;re not owned by a publisher? How big of a publisher? It&rsquo;s easy to be a publisher these days, most indies who put their games up on Steam are &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;. The definition of a publisher is that you&rsquo;re publishing the game and the goal of a lot of studios is to &ldquo;self-publish&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Or does being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just mean you came up with the idea?  The Cave was funded and published by SEGA, so was it an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; title? SEGA didn&rsquo;t come up with the idea and exerted no creative control, so does that make it an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; title?</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answers to any of these questions (and maybe there aren&rsquo;t any), but it irritates me that some devs (or fans) look down on devs because they are not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; or not &ldquo;indie enough&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Or is being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just another marketing term? Maybe that&rsquo;s all it means anymore.

Let&rsquo;s look at the word.</p>\n<p>The word &ldquo;indie&rdquo; comes from (I assume) the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  I guess the first question we have to ask is: independent from what? I think most people would say &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Yet, I know of several devs who proudly call themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo; when they are taking money from publishers (and big publishers at that) and other devs that would sneer at a dev taking publisher money and calling themselves &ldquo;indie&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>What about taking money from investors? If you take money are you not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? What about money from friends or family? Or does it have to be VCs for you to lose &ldquo;indie&rdquo; status?</p>\n<p>What about Kickstarter?  I guess it&rsquo;s OK for indies to take money from Kickstarter. But are you really &ldquo;independent&rdquo;?  3,000 backers who now feel a sense of entitlement might disagree. Devs who feel an intense sense of pressure from backers might also disagree.</p>\n<p>Does being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; mean your idea is independent from mainstream thinking? Is being an &ldquo;indie developer&rdquo; just the new Punk Rock.</p>\n<p>Does the type of game you&rsquo;re making define you as &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? If a dev is making a metrics driven F2P game, but they are doing it independent of a publisher, does that mean they are not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;?</p>\n<p>This is one of the biggest areas I see &ldquo;indie&rdquo; snobbery kick in.  Snobby &ldquo;indie&rdquo; devs will look at an idea and proclaim it &ldquo;not indie&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Do &ldquo;indie&rdquo; games have to be quirky and weird? Do &ldquo;indie&rdquo; games have to be about the &ldquo;art&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>What about the dev? Does that matter? Someone once told me I was not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; because I have an established name, despite the fact that the games I&rsquo;m currently working on have taken no money from investors or publishers and are made by three people.</p>\n<p>What if the game is hugely successful and makes a ton of money? Does that make it not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; anymore? Is being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; about being scrappy and clawing your way from nothing? Once you have success, are you no longer &ldquo;indie&rdquo;?  Is it like being an &ldquo;indie band&rdquo; where once they gain success, they are looked down on by the fans? Does success mean selling-out? Does selling-out revoke your &ldquo;indie dev&rdquo; card?</p>\n<p>What if the &ldquo;indie&rdquo; developer already has lots of money? Does having millions of dollars make them not &ldquo;indie&rdquo;? What if they made the money before they went &ldquo;indie&rdquo; or even before they started making games or if they have a rich (dead) aunt? Does &ldquo;indie&rdquo; mean you have to starve?</p>\n<p>Is it OK for an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; to hire top notch marketing and PR people? Or do &ldquo;indies&rdquo; have to scrape everything together themselves and use the grassroot network?</p>\n<p>Or does &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just mean you&rsquo;re not owned by a publisher? How big of a publisher? It&rsquo;s easy to be a publisher these days, most indies who put their games up on Steam are &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;. The definition of a publisher is that you&rsquo;re publishing the game and the goal of a lot of studios is to &ldquo;self-publish&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Or does being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just mean you came up with the idea?  The Cave was funded and published by SEGA, so was it an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; title? SEGA didn&rsquo;t come up with the idea and exerted no creative control, so does that make it an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; title?</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answers to any of these questions (and maybe there aren&rsquo;t any), but it irritates me that some devs (or fans) look down on devs because they are not &ldquo;indie&rdquo; or not &ldquo;indie enough&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Or is being &ldquo;indie&rdquo; just another marketing term? Maybe that&rsquo;s all it means anymore. It&rsquo;s just part of the PR plan.</p>'}}

They changed the name a year or so before I left when they rolled a bunch of divisions into this new company called LucasArts and the games group was one of them.  Many years later, all that was left in LucasArts was the old games group, so the name became synonymous with games.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me not to be sad. I haven&rsquo;t worked there since 1992, but it was still home to me. I grew up there. I learned just about everything I know about designing games there.  I became a real programmer there.

I&rsquo;m so good at it people actually send me death threats.  If you have a secret, you can tell me.  I won&rsquo;t tell anyone.  Go ahead.  I&rsquo;m listening.</p>\n<p>Over the past few months, I&rsquo;ve been the vessel for a couple of very exciting secrets and it&rsquo;s been really hard to not give someone the nudge-nudge-wink-wink-don&rsquo;t-tell-anyone, but I couldn&rsquo;t.  Not these.</p>\n<p>The first is the <a href="http://www.monkeyislandspecialedition.com">re-release of The Secret of Monkey Island</a>.  Several months ago I was invited to LucasArts to get a sneak preview.  Very cool.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will open up the pure pleasure that is Monkey Island to a whole new generation of gamer that  knows only how to use a console controller.</p>\n<p>The second secret is that <a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/monkeyisland">TellTale is doing an episodic version of Monkey Island</a>.  I had the great pleasure of spending a few days with Dave Grossman, Mike Stemmle and the rest of the TellTale crew getting my head into Guybrush Threepwood again.</p>\n<p>I am very exited for both of these games.  It&rsquo;s strange and humbling to see something you created 20 years ago take on a life of it&rsquo;s own.</p>\n<p>This next year is going to be very interesting.  Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer all have games coming out.  Someone check the scriptures.  Might be a good time to start hoarding canned goods.</p>\n<p>About a year and a little more ago, as I began designing the <a href="http://deathspank.com">uber-awesome DeathSpank</a>, I played all the way through The Secret of Monkey Island to refresh myself on the puzzles and dialog.</p>\n<p>I know this will come as a shock to many of you, but I don&rsquo;t spend my evenings playing through Monkey Island.  It&rsquo;s probably been 15 years since I sat down and really played it.</p>\n<p>Much like the experience of watching the <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/maniac_mansion_speed_run">Maniac Mansion Speed Run</a>, it bought back a lot of memories and little tid-bits of facts, so I started keeping notes and in celebration of all things Monkey Island, I thought I&rsquo;d share them.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, a couple of points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Some of this I&rsquo;ve written about before, so I apologize if I&rsquo;m wasting your time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I was playing the VGA version that was released after the original EGA version.  The original original version used 16 colors and the inventory was text only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These are only &ldquo;some-what&rdquo; in order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may disagree with me on some of these, and that&rsquo;s perfectly OK.  My life is forever intertwined with this game and some of these are more reflective than anything else.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 20 years.  My brain is full.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If anyone has specific questions about Monkey Island 1 or 2, feel free to ask them in the comments or <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/contact">send them to me</a>.  If the answer contain interesting information or fuels a good story, I&rsquo;ll add it to this list.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-14.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Someone please turn off the lights, and I&rsquo;ll start the projector.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-1a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The very small &ldquo;hot spot&rdquo; areas are very annoying today but they were accepted back then; they were even considered a good thing.  It&rsquo;s called Game Play!  It would be hard to make an adventure game today where players were forced to hunt for small objects.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-3a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Most people know you can hit the period key to skip a single line of dialog, but I&rsquo;m surprised when I run into people that don&rsquo;t know why I chose the period key.  It seems obvious to me: a period ends a sentence.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-4a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>While Insult Sword Fighting is one of the first things people think of when they hear Monkey Island, I thought it seemed little tedious (but fun) as I played though it again.  There is a point where you say &ldquo;I get it&rdquo;, but your still forced to go though the motions again and again.  If I was going to do Insult Sword Fighting in a future game, I&rsquo;d make it more free form allowing the player to be clever and construct their own sentences.</p>\n<p>During the early stages of the Monkey Island design, we would watch old Errol Flynn era pirate movies.  One thing that stood out was during the fights they always taunted each other with insults.  I knew we needed to have sword fighting in the game - it was about pirates after all - but I didn&rsquo;t want to introduce any action game play and the old pirate moves provided the perfect solution.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-12.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the late 80&rsquo;s, the mere thought of a scroll wheel on a mouse would have been crazy talk, but today I found it hard to break the habit of trying the scroll the inventory with it.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-8a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>You only have to follow the shop keeper to the Sword Master once, after that it&rsquo;s just automatic.  That was a good design choice.  No point in having to solve the same puzzle over and over.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-11a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Scene behind the walls of the governors mansion seemed a little long.  The original plan was to have real game play and puzzles, but the game was feeling too big and we need to cut stuff.  This gag was perfect, and in some ways better then making the player solve more puzzles.  Never be afraid to edit you game down if it needs it.  It will often be better for it.  Except this went on too long.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-28.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ahoy there, Fancy Pants&rdquo; is my favorite throw-away line ever.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-5a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Back then, the randomly generated forest was cutting edge technology.  Disk space was at a premium.  Everything had to fit on 5 floppy disks.  Sierra would ship games on 8 or 10 floppy disks. That was always a sore point for us.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-1b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I like the way you meet Otis, Sword Master and Meathook during regular puzzles, then hire them later.  Builds a sense of friendship before they are needed.  They aren&rsquo;t just three random people you meet for the first time while look for a crew.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-2b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The circus tent could have been more utilized.  Bit of a waste for one puzzle and the Fettucini Brothers didn&rsquo;t add much to the story.  That said, this was one of the first screens (&ldquo;rooms&rdquo; as we called them) where we used the SCUMM system&rsquo;s exclusive scrolling screens for dramatic effect.  Tim was the programmer on this room and he spent a lot of time getting it to scroll at just the right time to revel the tent.   I also like that the dialog choices are shown up up-side-down after Guybrush is shot from the cannon.  Doing that pushed the SCUMM system to utilize multiple fonts.  We didn&rsquo;t have that feature before this gag required it.  Guybrush being shot out of the canon was also foreshadowing for later when he needed to be shot out of the canon.  OK, come to think of it, this was a pretty useful room.</p>\n<p>CORRECTION: It is July 21, 2022 and Dave Grossman informs me it was he who worked on the circus.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-3c.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Touching the parrot puzzle was a little lame and linear.  I remember being rushed and we couldn&rsquo;t think of anything better.  The game was feeling good and long already, so I just punted on this puzzle.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-4b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>UI for having to open and close doors independently from walking though them was obnoxious.  You&rsquo;d never do this in an adventure game today, but like pixel hunting, it was accepted.</p>\n<p>Something I added to the Humongous Entertainment adventure games was the cursor changing into a big arrow when you hit the edge of the screen and it was an exit.  Monkey Island would have benefited from this.  I was so used to it from the Humongous games that I&rsquo;d scan the screen expecting to see it over exits.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-9a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>OK, I&rsquo;m going to admit that I was completely stumped by the grog puzzle.  I finally went and looked it up on the internet.  That&rsquo;s a damn good puzzle.  I found several puzzles would give me pause because I&rsquo;d remember some previous unimplemented version of them and it would throw me off track.  My brain is filled with a lot of old adventure game puzzles, most of which never made it into a game.  DeathSpank actually has a couple of puzzles ideas that we talked about for the original Monkey Island.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-5b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Stan&rsquo;s Grog machine was one of three interesting lessons was I given about trademarks and copyright during the production of Monkey Island.  Originally, I wanted the Grog Machine to be a Coke Machine, baring that, I wanted it to look like a Coke machine.  It originally had the &ldquo;Coke Wave&rdquo; on it, but said &ldquo;Grog&rdquo;.  The Lucasfilm legal team came back and said it was too close to the real trademarked Coke Wave.  I tried to argue Parody to no avail.  We kept changing it little by little until legal was satisfied it didn&rsquo;t look too much like a Coke machine.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-11b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Getting stuck on the Ocean floor is one of my favorite puzzles because the solution is so obvious most people overlook it.  The other puzzle I did in this same vane was in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade adventure game where Indy has to have faith and just walk over a ledge.  Players that had faith and just clicked on the other side of the crevice had no problem.  Players that fiddled around and clicked on other stuff, ignoring the advice, always fell.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-12a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I forgot about the ladder to get the pirate flag for the soup.  I kept focusing on Meat Hook&rsquo;s tattoo, which was something we talked about during the early design.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-13.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I had wanted the time you spent on Monkey Island to feel more like a RPG, which is why you had top-down view.  As the game progressed, I slowly scaled back those plans, but we were still left with these very cool maps.  I love maps.  For me a game design always starts with a map.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-8b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The key to the Monkey Head used to be called a Q-Tip(tm), but in my second legal lesson of the project it was changed.  According to our legal advice, it would have been OK if we were using the Q-Tip in a &ldquo;correct fashion&rdquo;, but taking a giant Q-Tip and sticking it into a stone monkey&rsquo;s ear is not &ldquo;correct usage&rdquo;.  Interestingly enough, a Q-Tip box states: &ldquo;Do not insert cotton swab into ear canal&rdquo;.  I think we were doing just that.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-17.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I had a feeling in hell here would be mushrooms&rdquo; was one of Tim&rsquo;s lines.  Tim hates Mushrooms.  I also hate mushrooms, but unlike Tim, I&rsquo;m happy to pick them out.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-31.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>We called them &ldquo;Special Case Animations&rdquo;.  The first SCUMM game they appeared in was The Last Crusade and then used to an amazing (well, amazing for 1990) extent in Monkey Island.   Each of the &ldquo;actor&rdquo; sprites had a set of basic animations that including standing, walking, talking, picking up and reaching.   If we need an animation that would only be used on one place, it was called a Special Case Animation and each one was carefully considered due to the 5 floppy disk limit.  Every pixel had to count.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-16.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Begging for the necklace from the head of the navigator is a bad puzzle.  It&rsquo;s too easy for players to think they&rsquo;re on the wrong path.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-5c.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>After getting the root, we didn&rsquo;t make the player walk all the way back to the cannibals then all the way to the ghost ship.  There was much discussion about this.  I think we made the right decision.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-12b.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, Monkey Island is fairly open ended allowing players a lot of freedom to explore and solve several puzzle threads at a time, but there are two big choke points where the puzzles become very self contained.  The first is on the ship as you&rsquo;re sailing (or trying to sail to) Monkey Island.  The second is while you&rsquo;re on the ghost ship.  All the solutions to puzzles can be found right where you are.  These were done on purpose to give the player a small break and allow them to focus on one area.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-29a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve made you way back to Melee Island, you are forced to kill two ghost pirates with your root beer.  This was important because it showed not only how the root beer worked but that it would work.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-18.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Elaine Marley was just called &ldquo;The Governor&rdquo; until the scene in the church was written.  Dave Grossman wrote that scene and put in the gag dialog choice where Guybrush shouts &ldquo;Elaine!&rdquo;, which is from the movie &ldquo;The Graduate&rdquo;.  I liked that, so it became her name.  In the original design, Elaine was a more ruthless Governor, but she softened up and became a true love interested as the project processed.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-26.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>By design, the whole ending of the game is a &ldquo;gimme&rdquo;.   The player has worked hard to get to this point, I wanted something they could just sit back and enjoy playing.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-30.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>There was supposed to be ship combat during your voyage to Monkey Island.  It would have been done top-down view with you controlling the ship and firing a cannon.  It was right to cut that.  Never be afraid to cut.  It&rsquo;s rare that I watch a &ldquo;director&rsquo;s cut&rdquo; of a film that is better then the original.  Most of that stuff was left out for a reason.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-3d.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Last legal snafu we had with Monkey Island revolved about a &ldquo;Look At&rdquo; line in the voodoo shop.  When you&rsquo;d look at a statue, Guybrush would say &ldquo;Looks like an emaciated Charles Atlas.&rdquo;  We got a cease and desist letter for that and has to change it in future versions.  I don&rsquo;t know for sure when version it changed in.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-27.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>THE END</p>\n<p>P.S.  I was always bothered by these close-ups.  While they were great art, I never felt they matched the style of the rest of the game.  Not sure how I feel about them 20 years later.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<p>I&rsquo;m pretty good at keeping secrets.  I&rsquo;m so good at it people actually send me death threats.  If you have a secret, you can tell me.  I won&rsquo;t tell anyone.  Go ahead.  I&rsquo;m listening.</p>\n<p>Over the past few months, I&rsquo;ve been the vessel for a couple of very exciting secrets and it&rsquo;s been really hard to not give someone the nudge-nudge-wink-wink-don&rsquo;t-tell-anyone, but I couldn&rsquo;t.  Not these.</p>\n<p>The first is the <a href="http://www.monkeyislandspecialedition.com">re-release of The Secret of Monkey Island</a>.  Several months ago I was invited to LucasArts to get a sneak preview.  Very cool.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will open up the pure pleasure that is Monkey Island to a whole new generation of gamer that  knows only how to use a console controller.</p>\n<p>The second secret is that <a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/monkeyisland">TellTale is doing an episodic version of Monkey Island</a>.  I had the great pleasure of spending a few days with Dave Grossman, Mike Stemmle and the rest of the TellTale crew getting my head into Guybrush Threepwood again.</p>\n<p>I am very exited for both of these games.  It&rsquo;s strange and humbling to see something you created 20 years ago take on a life of it&rsquo;s own.</p>\n<p>This next year is going to be very interesting.  Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer all have games coming out.  Someone check the scriptures.  Might be a good time to start hoarding canned goods.</p>\n<p>About a year and a little more ago, as I began designing the <a href="http://deathspank.com">uber-awesome DeathSpank</a>, I played all the way through The Secret of Monkey Island to refresh myself on the puzzles and dialog.</p>\n<p>I know this will come as a shock to many of you, but I don&rsquo;t spend my evenings playing through Monkey Island.  It&rsquo;s probably been 15 years since I sat down and really played it.</p>\n<p>Much like the experience of watching the <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/maniac_mansion_speed_run">Maniac Mansion Speed Run</a>, it bought back a lot of memories and little tid-bits of facts, so I started keeping notes and in celebration of all things Monkey Island, I thought I&rsquo;d share them.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, a couple of points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Some of this I&rsquo;ve written about before, so I apologize if I&rsquo;m wasting your time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I was playing the VGA version that was released after the original EGA version.  The original original version used 16 colors and the inventory was text only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These are only &ldquo;some-what&rdquo; in order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may disagree with me on some of these, and that&rsquo;s perfectly OK.  My life is forever intertwined with this game and some of these are more reflective than anything else.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 20 years.  My brain is full.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If anyone has specific questions about Monkey Island 1 or 2, feel free to ask them in the comments or <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/contact">send them to me</a>.  If the answer contain interesting information or fuels a good story, I&rsquo;ll add it to this list.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-14.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Someone please turn off the lights, and I&rsquo;ll start the projector.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-1a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The very small &ldquo;hot spot&rdquo; areas are very annoying today but they were accepted back then; they were even considered a good thing.  It&rsquo;s called Game Play!  It would be hard to make an adventure game today where players were forced to hunt for small objects.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-3a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Most people know you can hit the period key to skip a single line of dialog, but I&rsquo;m surprised when I run into people that don&rsquo;t know why I chose the period key.  It seems obvious to me: a period ends a sentence.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-4a.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>While Insult Sword Fighting is one of the first things people think of when they hear Monkey Island, I thought it seemed little tedious (but fun) as I played though it again.

This was important because it showed not only how the root beer worked but that it would work.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-18.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Elaine Marley was just called &ldquo;The Governor&rdquo; until the scene in the church was written.  Dave Grossman wrote that scene and put in the gag dialog choice where Guybrush shouts &ldquo;Elaine!&rdquo;, which is from the movie &ldquo;The Graduate&rdquo;.  I liked that, so it became her name.  In the original design, Elaine was a more ruthless Governor, but she softened up and became a true love interested as the project processed.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-26.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>By design, the whole ending of the game is a &ldquo;gimme&rdquo;.   The player has worked hard to get to this point, I wanted something they could just sit back and enjoy playing.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-30.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>There was supposed to be ship combat during your voyage to Monkey Island.  It would have been done top-down view with you controlling the ship and firing a cannon.  It was right to cut that.  Never be afraid to cut.  It&rsquo;s rare that I watch a &ldquo;director&rsquo;s cut&rdquo; of a film that is better then the original.  Most of that stuff was left out for a reason.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-3d.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Last legal snafu we had with Monkey Island revolved about a &ldquo;Look At&rdquo; line in the voodoo shop.  When you&rsquo;d look at a statue, Guybrush would say &ldquo;Looks like an emaciated Charles Atlas.&rdquo;  We got a cease and desist letter for that and has to change it in future versions.  I don&rsquo;t know for sure when version it changed in.</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mi-27.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>THE END</p>\n<p>P.S.  I was always bothered by these close-ups.  While they were great art, I never felt they matched the style of the rest of the game.  Not sure how I feel about them 20 years later.</p>'}}

It is huge and feels huge.  The world is so visually tasty and really seems to be designed as a real world, not just a vehicle for quests.  After several days of questing, I made it to the coast, the sun was setting and I just stared out into the sea, letting my mind wonder, just like I do at the real Ocean.  Several other players were doing the same.  That is a real achievement.</li>\n<li>I find it amusing that when you loot a corpse while grouped, a &ldquo;roll a dice&rdquo; interface comes up to see who gets the booty.  It&rsquo;s an interesting holdover from the D&amp;D days.  Why dice?  Why not paper-scissor-rock.  That&rsquo;s why I would do.  Of course, one of my dreams has been to make the worlds first Massively Multiplayer Paper Scissor Rocks game (MMPSRG).  I actually wrote a whole design for it.</li>\n<li>I really enjoy (and am impressed by) the art style and art direction.  I&rsquo;ve always like the Warcraft world because it has a nice hint of cartoomieness (not a real word).   They translated this into a pure 3D environment perfectly.</li>\n<li>Why aren&rsquo;t other players more friendly?  It&rsquo;s not that people are rude, it&rsquo;s just that nobody is very chatty.  I&rsquo;ve tried to strike up conversations with several other people and am ignored or greeted with a simple &ldquo;hi&rdquo;, follow by a dash down the road.   Other than the people in my group, everyone else might as well be NPC&rsquo;s.</li>\n<li>I would like to see an option for &ldquo;word balloons&rdquo; above peoples heads when they speak.  I don&rsquo;t pay much attention to the chat area in the lower left.  This might help with the social aspect of chatting.</li>\n<li>The in-game maps stink.  The close-up ones are OK, but when you zoom out, there is no context.  You are really forced to hunt down better maps on the internet.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;d like to be able to mouse over buildings to see what they are.  I hate wandering into town and having to hunt down the right building.  I know you can mouse over the signs, but they often aren&rsquo;t visible.</li>\n<li>One of my favorite activities is what I call &ldquo;drive-by-cowing&rdquo;.  Once you get up in levels, you can take out a cow in a single swing.  Start about 100 feet way and run towards the cow, as you pass, swing and take it out.  Keep running and see how many cows you can take out.  It&rsquo;s twice as fun with someone following you taking screen shots.</li>\n<li>Nobody seems to mind that I go around killing livestock, which I assume the locals use for meat, milk and possibly companionship on a lonely night.  Maybe if I keep doing it, people will slowly start to starve and I&rsquo;ll feel bad.  I&rsquo;d like to see the guards come over and give me a little sword-smack for killing cows and sheep.</li>\n<li>Why can bears and boars resist my magic?  Come on, they&rsquo;re animals, and not wicked-cool magic animals, just plain old animals.  Makes no sense.  Suspension of disbelief alert.</li>\n<li>It&rsquo;s pretty funny to see someone being chased by a &ldquo;train&rdquo; of monsters.  We were exploring this old mine the other day, and while standing in a tunnel some guys runs by the entrance being chanced by 5 Tunnel Rats.  Do I help out?  No, I just &ldquo;/point-n-laugh&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>All the vendors seem to sell the same stuff.  It&rsquo;s like they all have the same distributor.  I&rsquo;d like to find more interesting items at different places.  I started out looking for some better Maces, but soon gave up when I realized it&rsquo;s just a chain store.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m currently at Level 15, and I&rsquo;ve been in the weapon, armor and magic doldrums for quite a few levels now.  Nothing really new and interesting.  I&rsquo;m starting to tire of my mace and the same 3 magic spells.  I&rsquo;m a product of the MTV generation, I need new spells every 15 minutes.</li>\n<li>Needs more Pirates!</li>\n<li>You should get extra XP for killing a new creatures for the first time.  It was really disappointing to discover the Mechanical Golems, excitingly enter battle and discover that I got the same XP as I did for the Bear down the road.  I realize that it&rsquo;s all numbers under the veneer of a texture-map, but it was new for me, and I wanted to be rewarded.</li>\n<li>Can you move a character to another server?  I didn&rsquo;t see a way to do this, and I don&rsquo;t see any reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to.  It was very frustrating to run into someone (in the real world&hellip;stay with me) and find out they are playing, but we&rsquo;re on different server.  I can see how they wouldn&rsquo;t want people jumping servers on a whim, but having it take a few days, or give a character a limited number of jumps would be nice.</li>\n<li>I am always annoyed by games that they to make inventory management a game-play mechanism.  Why can I only carry 12 things?  Why does a huge two hand rock-hammer take as much space as 10 drops of spider spuge?  Seems like I should be able to carry as much spider spuge as I want.</li>\n<li>The city of Stormwind is simple amazing.  It real feels like you&rsquo;re in the midsts of a real husseling and busseling city.  I am constantly amazed and impressed with the layout and architecture of the world.  We have come to call this place &ldquo;Mall of America&rdquo;.  All it needs is a Roller-coaster in the middle.</li>\n<li>The fact that the Tram and the Gryphon rides that place in the 3D world is great.  They could have cheaped out and made them canned sequences, but they didn&rsquo;t.  It&rsquo;s fun to see other people battling for XP below you, or see someone fly-by on a Gryphon as you track over the mountains.</li>\n<li>I would really like to see some sort of story.  Oh sure, there is a story in the opening cut-scene about something or another, fact is I watched about 7 seconds of it before hitting ESC.   I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;m running around killing everything that I see, getting XP, getting money and repeating the cycle.  I&rsquo;d like to think there was some greater goal we were all reaching for, and one that really mattered to my character and my day-to-day actions.  I know some other MMG&rsquo;s has tried to do this sort of thing with limited success.</li>\n<li>I like the game play mechanism of dying and being taken to the closest cemetery, then trekking as a ghost to recover your body.  It feels right in terms of risky actions verses the penalty.  Last night we discovered a cave system under a building.  As we walked though the deserted tunnels, my heart was beating and I was genuinely worried about running into a group of Bandits and dying.  In a single player game, I would have just saved and all the tension would have been gone.  We did end up dying, but 3 minutes later we we back in our bodies running like hell to get out.  Perfect experience.</li>\n<li>I really dislike the class system found in most D&amp;D inspired RPG&rsquo;s.  It make little sense to me that just because I am a Paladin I can&rsquo;t use a gun.  Seems like I should be able to use what ever I train for and get good at.  There could be certain skills that counter each other, like getting good at magic could demising your sword-play.  I want to pick up a gun and try to blast things.  I&rsquo;m not asking to be very good at it, but at least let me try it.</li>\n<li>There were a lot of people playing on Valentines Day&hellip;just saying.</li>\n<li>I am curious to know the story behind the simultaneous release of the Mac and Windows versions.  The only reason I own this game is because there is a Mac version.  What was the decision making process?  Are there any lessons for other publishers to learn?</li>\n<li>And finally, why the hell can&rsquo;t they remember my username and password.  Just a little checkbox that says &ldquo;Remember Username and Password&rdquo; would be great.  I am the only person that uses my machine, and if it was compromised, the last thing I would be worrying about the 129 pieces of copper being held by my character.</li>\n<li>I realize the preceding bullet points contain a lot of nitpicking criticism, but they are just that, nitpicking.  Over all, this is one incredibly impressive game.  I can only imagine the amount of work that went into the designing and construction of the worlds, towns and buildings.  While I&rsquo;ve sure there is to some degree, I can&rsquo;t detect any cookie cutter places.</li>\n<li>The game is strangely (for me anyway) addictive.  I play for a few hours every day.  Afterwards, I feel like I wasted my evening or weekend, only to be anxious to get back to it the next day.  It is quickly becoming the game I&rsquo;ve played the most.</li>\n<li>I do wonder why I play the game so much.  For me, it is really a two player LAN game.  The fact that 600,000 other people are also playing is irrelevant, or is it?  I don&rsquo;t interact with anyone else, for all I care those other players are NPC&rsquo;s, but there is something enticing about being with other people, even if you ignore each other.  Maybe that&rsquo;s why I enjoy going to the movies and sitting in the dark with a bunch of strangers.</li>\n<li>Good news is, no ones cell phone as rung during combat.  &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hey!  Guess what I&rsquo;m doing?  Yeah, Killing a Trogg, it&rsquo;s awesome dude.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now for the obligatory screen shots:</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow5.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow1.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow2.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow3.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow4.jpg" />', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<p>I am not a big player of MMORPMMGOMMGS, the last one I spent any time on being Ultima Online when it first came out, plus a few hours on EverQuest, so I might be impressed by things that are old-hat&hellip;</p>\n<p>In the interest of brevity and for all the executives and marketing people that read the Grumpy Gamer, I figured I&rsquo;d just bullet point my feedback.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I am awestruck by the scope of the world.

Once you get up in levels, you can take out a cow in a single swing.  Start about 100 feet way and run towards the cow, as you pass, swing and take it out.  Keep running and see how many cows you can take out.  It&rsquo;s twice as fun with someone following you taking screen shots.</li>\n<li>Nobody seems to mind that I go around killing livestock, which I assume the locals use for meat, milk and possibly companionship on a lonely night.  Maybe if I keep doing it, people will slowly start to starve and I&rsquo;ll feel bad.  I&rsquo;d like to see the guards come over and give me a little sword-smack for killing cows and sheep.</li>\n<li>Why can bears and boars resist my magic?  Come on, they&rsquo;re animals, and not wicked-cool magic animals, just plain old animals.  Makes no sense.  Suspension of disbelief alert.</li>\n<li>It&rsquo;s pretty funny to see someone being chased by a &ldquo;train&rdquo; of monsters.  We were exploring this old mine the other day, and while standing in a tunnel some guys runs by the entrance being chanced by 5 Tunnel Rats.  Do I help out?  No, I just &ldquo;/point-n-laugh&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>All the vendors seem to sell the same stuff.  It&rsquo;s like they all have the same distributor.  I&rsquo;d like to find more interesting items at different places.  I started out looking for some better Maces, but soon gave up when I realized it&rsquo;s just a chain store.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m currently at Level 15, and I&rsquo;ve been in the weapon, armor and magic doldrums for quite a few levels now.  Nothing really new and interesting.  I&rsquo;m starting to tire of my mace and the same 3 magic spells.  I&rsquo;m a product of the MTV generation, I need new spells every 15 minutes.</li>\n<li>Needs more Pirates!</li>\n<li>You should get extra XP for killing a new creatures for the first time.  It was really disappointing to discover the Mechanical Golems, excitingly enter battle and discover that I got the same XP as I did for the Bear down the road.  I realize that it&rsquo;s all numbers under the veneer of a texture-map, but it was new for me, and I wanted to be rewarded.</li>\n<li>Can you move a character to another server?  I didn&rsquo;t see a way to do this, and I don&rsquo;t see any reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to.  It was very frustrating to run into someone (in the real world&hellip;stay with me) and find out they are playing, but we&rsquo;re on different server.  I can see how they wouldn&rsquo;t want people jumping servers on a whim, but having it take a few days, or give a character a limited number of jumps would be nice.</li>\n<li>I am always annoyed by games that they to make inventory management a game-play mechanism.  Why can I only carry 12 things?  Why does a huge two hand rock-hammer take as much space as 10 drops of spider spuge?  Seems like I should be able to carry as much spider spuge as I want.</li>\n<li>The city of Stormwind is simple amazing.  It real feels like you&rsquo;re in the midsts of a real husseling and busseling city.  I am constantly amazed and impressed with the layout and architecture of the world.  We have come to call this place &ldquo;Mall of America&rdquo;.  All it needs is a Roller-coaster in the middle.</li>\n<li>The fact that the Tram and the Gryphon rides that place in the 3D world is great.  They could have cheaped out and made them canned sequences, but they didn&rsquo;t.  It&rsquo;s fun to see other people battling for XP below you, or see someone fly-by on a Gryphon as you track over the mountains.</li>\n<li>I would really like to see some sort of story.  Oh sure, there is a story in the opening cut-scene about something or another, fact is I watched about 7 seconds of it before hitting ESC.   I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;m running around killing everything that I see, getting XP, getting money and repeating the cycle.  I&rsquo;d like to think there was some greater goal we were all reaching for, and one that really mattered to my character and my day-to-day actions.  I know some other MMG&rsquo;s has tried to do this sort of thing with limited success.</li>\n<li>I like the game play mechanism of dying and being taken to the closest cemetery, then trekking as a ghost to recover your body.  It feels right in terms of risky actions verses the penalty.  Last night we discovered a cave system under a building.  As we walked though the deserted tunnels, my heart was beating and I was genuinely worried about running into a group of Bandits and dying.  In a single player game, I would have just saved and all the tension would have been gone.  We did end up dying, but 3 minutes later we we back in our bodies running like hell to get out.  Perfect experience.</li>\n<li>I really dislike the class system found in most D&amp;D inspired RPG&rsquo;s.  It make little sense to me that just because I am a Paladin I can&rsquo;t use a gun.  Seems like I should be able to use what ever I train for and get good at.  There could be certain skills that counter each other, like getting good at magic could demising your sword-play.  I want to pick up a gun and try to blast things.  I&rsquo;m not asking to be very good at it, but at least let me try it.</li>\n<li>There were a lot of people playing on Valentines Day&hellip;just saying.</li>\n<li>I am curious to know the story behind the simultaneous release of the Mac and Windows versions.  The only reason I own this game is because there is a Mac version.  What was the decision making process?  Are there any lessons for other publishers to learn?</li>\n<li>And finally, why the hell can&rsquo;t they remember my username and password.  Just a little checkbox that says &ldquo;Remember Username and Password&rdquo; would be great.  I am the only person that uses my machine, and if it was compromised, the last thing I would be worrying about the 129 pieces of copper being held by my character.</li>\n<li>I realize the preceding bullet points contain a lot of nitpicking criticism, but they are just that, nitpicking.  Over all, this is one incredibly impressive game.  I can only imagine the amount of work that went into the designing and construction of the worlds, towns and buildings.  While I&rsquo;ve sure there is to some degree, I can&rsquo;t detect any cookie cutter places.</li>\n<li>The game is strangely (for me anyway) addictive.  I play for a few hours every day.  Afterwards, I feel like I wasted my evening or weekend, only to be anxious to get back to it the next day.  It is quickly becoming the game I&rsquo;ve played the most.</li>\n<li>I do wonder why I play the game so much.  For me, it is really a two player LAN game.  The fact that 600,000 other people are also playing is irrelevant, or is it?  I don&rsquo;t interact with anyone else, for all I care those other players are NPC&rsquo;s, but there is something enticing about being with other people, even if you ignore each other.  Maybe that&rsquo;s why I enjoy going to the movies and sitting in the dark with a bunch of strangers.</li>\n<li>Good news is, no ones cell phone as rung during combat.  &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hey!  Guess what I&rsquo;m doing?  Yeah, Killing a Trogg, it&rsquo;s awesome dude.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now for the obligatory screen shots:</p>\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow5.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow1.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow2.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow3.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\t<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ggwow4.jpg" />'}}

In the days before Steam and Kickstarter, but most of it is still applicable, but a lot has also changed.</h3>\n<p>Someone recently submitted a question asking what it would take to build a classic 2D point-n-click adventure today and would it be a viable business?  The internet is filled with classic adventure fan sites centered around the LucasArts and Sierra games and a common thread is always how much people would like to see new ones being made, and why isn&rsquo;t it being done.</p>\n<p>These are interesting questions that I&rsquo;ve ponder a lot in the last year, but never really looked into it in any detail.</p>\n<p>Now, before I launch into this long stream-of-consciousness, there are a couple of important things to understand.  First, this is only a thought experiment.  This is not something I am planning on doing, or even have a huge interest in doing, so please don&rsquo;t feed the rumor mills.  Second, this article contains gory and gruesome details about the games business and, in particular, marketing and distribution.  If you&rsquo;d rather remain blissfully oblivious to the horrors of what goes on behind the scenes, this is the place to stop reading.  If you&rsquo;re one of those people that can&rsquo;t help but stare at a car accident, read on.</p>\n<p>For this exercise, I am going to make a few assumptions.</p>\n<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>\n<h3 id="1-were-building-a-classic-2d-point-n-click-adventure-game">1) We&rsquo;re building a classic 2D point-n-click adventure game.</h3>\n<p>Building the game in 3D is a much more costly endeavor that brings with it a whole slew of complications which I won&rsquo;t get in to in this article.  The goal here is a class point-n-click adventure.</p>\n<h3 id="2-were-hiring-real-employees-to-build-the-game">2) We&rsquo;re hiring real employees to build the game.</h3>\n<p>Clearly, the game could be done cheaper with hobbyists or people passionate enough about the genre to work for free or below cost, for back-end, or with a trust-fund baby on staff, but the goal in putting together this plan is to explore it as real business, and our business model is a little screwed if we count on people working for free.  Also, given that deadlines will become important, it&rsquo;s necessary to have everyone&rsquo;s full attention and nothing says that better then a paycheck, except maybe a cattle-prod, but that might be illegal.  I&rsquo;d have to check.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to hire the best people possible.  This is not a diss to the hobbyist market, there are some very talented people out there, but we&rsquo;ll need our team all in one place and not working at other jobs or going to school.  If you&rsquo;re an unemployed adventure game developer hobbyist, please contact our fictional company for a fictional job interview.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also assuming we have to pay competitive wages, and most of my pay information comes from the Seattle area, so we&rsquo;ll use that data for now.  It&rsquo;s probably more expensive in the Bay Area, but cheaper in India.</p>\n<h3 id="3-were-going-to-focus-on-the-development-and-product-related-costs-only">3) We&rsquo;re going to focus on the development and product related costs only.</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of other overhead in running a company, even a small developer, we&rsquo;ll ignore those.  There are also huge costs associated being a publisher, like marketing, sales, distribution, graft, etc.  We&rsquo;ll ignore these for now, but touch on them later on the article.</p>\n<h3 id="4-the-engine-technology-is-not-included-in-the-costs">4) The engine technology is not included in the costs.</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of 2D engines out there that will do what we need, so we&rsquo;ll just assume we&rsquo;re using one of those.  I realize that many of them are Open Source, which could complicate or help our situation.  I&rsquo;m going to call it a wash and ignore the whole situation for now.  Trust me, It&rsquo;s not that hard to get your hands on a good solid 2D engine for next to nothing.</p>\n<h3 id="5-the-game-is-state-of-the-art-as-far-as-2d-goes">5) The game is state-of-the-art, as far as 2D goes.</h3>\n<p>Yeah, I know.  The last time you read state-of-the-art and 2D in the same sentence was back in the early 90&rsquo;s.  The game will be fully animated and include wall-to-wall original music and full voice.  No corners will be cut in the quality of the production.</p>\n<p>Although some styles of art might be cheaper to produce than others, I don&rsquo;t think the savings is going to be dramatic.  We might want to go with a pre-rendered 3D look rather then the traditional 2D animation found in a lot of 2D adventure games.  Doing pre-rendered 3D might be a little more expensive because the tools tended to cost a lot, and 3D animators (as a rule) can be more expensive.  People argue that you end up saving because it&rsquo;s easier to animate once you have the models built, but I have not seen this to be true, but my experience is a little limited in this area.</p>\n<h3 id="6-were-going-to-build-the-game-in-a-year">6) We&rsquo;re going to build the game in a year.</h3>\n<p>For a classic point-n-click adventure, this is aggressive, but should be doable.  Monkey Island took less than a year.  We&rsquo;ll need a lot more art, but that&rsquo;s a production issue and can easily be made up for with more people to a certain extent.  We&rsquo;re also going to do a very rigorous pre-production, this will be essential in getting the game done on time and on budget.  Since we&rsquo;re dealing with known technology, this should be very predictable.</p>\n<h3 id="7-were-using-an-established-publisher-for-the-game-and-not-self-publishing">7) We&rsquo;re using an established publisher for the game, and not self-publishing.</h3>\n<p>Starting a company that will self-publish the game into retail channels is a huge undertaking and would require some significant capital.  Not impossible, but we&rsquo;d need money beyond the cost of development, and that is a whole different business plan.  It&rsquo;s also hard to become a retail based publisher with a single game.  You need several games to have any clout with the retailers.  We could do a distribution deal, but then we&rsquo;re significantly cutting into our profit.  As the last two sentences suggest, we&rsquo;re also assuming in-store distribution, online distribution will be covered later.</p>\n<h3 id="8-its-a-pc-game">8) It&rsquo;s a PC game</h3>\n<p>Dealing with the console manufactures on something like this would be a nightmare, plus the royalties you pay to them would kill us with a nitch game like this and it&rsquo;s just not the venue for these types of games.  At least not to start.</p>\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s roll up our sleeves, pull out our slide-rules and get down to business.</p>\n<h2 id="development-costs-and-plan">Development costs and plan</h2>\n<p>Staffing is the main expense, and is always a hotly debated topic.  Everyone has an opinion, and I&rsquo;m sure this will be no different.  Until a complete pre-production is done, it&rsquo;s hard to nail this cost down.  These figures are based on my experience building adventures at Humongous Entertainment and at my last company Hulabee Entertainment.  We probably built more 2D graphic adventure games than any other company in the world and we had a finely tuned production process.  Granted, these games were for kids, but that only affects the scope of the project.  If you&rsquo;ve ever played any of those games, you will understand what I mean.</p>\n<p>Remember, not everyone on this list would be on the project for the entire 12 months.  This creates some complications because you need to keep people around to ensure a skilled staff for the next game.  Hopefully we could get two games going in such a way that people would be moved off one project onto another.  One advantage the movie business has is an infrastructure to deal with production people coming and going from projects.  In the game business we don&rsquo;t have that.  But, I&rsquo;m going to ignore this issue for now.  We&rsquo;ll assume there are other projects to keep people busy and there is no down-time.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also going to assume the design and creative lead is either the lead programmer, lead artist, or both.</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer (will also deal with engine issues)\nLead Artist\nProducer</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $220,000</strong></p>\n<p>3 Programmers (in the scripting language)<br />\n5 Artists (skilled in 2D animation)\\</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $480,000</strong></p>\n<p>Testing</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $30,000</strong></p>\n<p>Other expenses that will be contracted out:</p>\n<p>Script\nMusic<br />\nSound<br />\nVoice talent (non-union)<br />\nVoice recording</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $60,000</strong></p>\n<p>The total cost for a 12 month project - including a standard 20% overhead for insurance, taxes, graft, paper-clips and a little rounding up - comes to:</p>\n<p><strong>Project Development Total: $950,000</strong></p>\n<p>Now, we can argue all day about how much we&rsquo;re paying people, whether someone is over or under payed, etc.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  My defense is that this comes from my direct experience in hiring people to do the exact same jobs.  We can certainly save some money by hiring talented people with no experience, and that often works very well, but I&rsquo;m assuming that at least half the people are experienced in the business.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve kept the team pretty lean.  It would be easy to dump the Producer, but that would be a huge mistake.  A good and talented Producer is gold.  We can also save a little money if the script or music is done by someone already on the team, but that will take them away from their other job and you have to ask yourself:  are they really the best person for the task?</p>\n<p>This cost is also just for development.  If we&rsquo;re going to fully evaluate the prospects of a 2D point-n-click adventure in today&rsquo;s market, we need to think about marketing costs on top of development.  Even if we use an established publisher, we&rsquo;re going to need to include this in order to evaluate the ROI (return on investment) that a publisher is going to look at.</p>\n<h2 id="marketing-costs">Marketing Costs</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s assume marketing costs comes in at $500,000.  This figure is probably about half of what it should be.  We can&rsquo;t just take out full page ads in the game rags and pepper the gaming sites with banner ads.  We&rsquo;re going to need a good solid grass-roots campaign.  If we&rsquo;re really clever we could get away with a number like this.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon to spend as much on marketing as it cost to develop the game.  The marketing budgets for mainstream console games reach $10 million and more, but since we&rsquo;re not doing console, we save the drain of TV ads.  We can also be clever with our PR and get the marketing costs down as much as possible.  Lots of PR will go a long way on the initial game, but once the novelty wears off (and competition begins), we&rsquo;ll have to spend marketing money.   As sad as it is, the best games don&rsquo;t always sell just because they are good.  It takes good marketing to be successful.  Never underestimate good marketing.</p>\n<p>One big area of concern here is if we&rsquo;re going through a publisher, we&rsquo;re going to have to rely on them being clever with marketing and PR.  That&rsquo;s a big risk.  Most publisher try and fit everything into a template.  We&rsquo;re going to need a publisher that is willing to think differently about this.  It&rsquo;s an important trait to be looking for as we hunt for a publisher.  But, as anyone who is pitching a 2D adventure game today will tell you, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of choices.</p>\n<p>I see this as the single-most risky part of this venture.</p>\n<p>For the first part of this evaluation, we&rsquo;re going to assume we&rsquo;re going through retail distribution.  In reality, this is the most likely scenario.  But more on that later.</p>\n<h1 id="retail-distribution">Retail Distribution</h1>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll do that math for three different price points, $19, $29 and $39.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s realistic to assume a $49 price.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure this is obvious to most everyone, but I&rsquo;ll point it out anyway.  The publisher does not get the full retail price of the game.  The stores have to make a profit as well.  The publisher sells the game to the retailer for what&rsquo;s called the Wholesale price.  The store can then sell the game for whatever they want, but for the most part, they use the following numbers:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Wholesale $15</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Wholesale $22</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Wholesale $30</strong></p>\n<p>There is also MDF (Marketing Development Funds) and co-op charges that the publisher needs to pay the retailer, and those typically run 6% of the Wholesale price billed quarterly, net of returns.  These cost go to cover in-store advertising, news-paper circulars, etc.  In addition, publishers also pay to have their games on &ldquo;end-caps&rdquo; or have special &ldquo;shelf-talkers&rdquo; (they don&rsquo;t really talk, thank-god, but I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s coming) that helps point out the product.  General rule of thumb is: if there is anything in the store that calls any attention to the game, it was paid for by the publisher.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll assume we&rsquo;re not going to pay for anything beyond the required co-op and MDF, but it might be a wise investment to buy some better placement.</p>\n<p>We also have the cost of the box, CD, manual, shipping, graft, etc.  This is called Cost of Goods, or COGs for short.  This will typically be $1.50 unless we want to throw some cool extra stuff in the box like we used to do in the olden-days.  Could be a good idea for the initial launch, if so, we&rsquo;ll bill that to marketing.</p>\n<p>There are also fees for outside sales commissions, distribution, EDI (electronic inventory management), inventory management, field merchandising, etc.  This will add another $1 to the cost of our game.</p>\n<p>We need to assume that we&rsquo;re going to get returns.  These might come from damaged product, customer returns, or games that the just don&rsquo;t sell.  We have to account for this, it&rsquo;s typically 20%.  As a side note, next time a store tells you they can&rsquo;t take a game back because the publisher won&rsquo;t take it back, call bullshit.  Of course, it&rsquo;s not as simple as the publisher giving the money back, it&rsquo;s typically done as credit, and it&rsquo;s often negotiated with respect to new games being bought from the publisher.  It is one of the reason that a single game publisher is going to have a hard time.</p>\n<p>So after all this, plus a little rounding, we&rsquo;re down to the following profit:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Profit $9</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Profit $18</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Profit $25</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s now time to calculate our break-even point.  That is the point that our publisher has made all their money back.  To do this, we divide the total cost of the project by the profit at each price-point.</p>\n<p>Our game cost $1,400,000 to build and (minimally) market, so to break-even we need to sell the following units at each price-point:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Break even units 155,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Break even units 75,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Break even units 56,000</strong></p>\n<p>Hmmmm&hellip;.</p>\n<p>There is quite a jump from the $19 to the $29 price point.  It will be tempting to try and sell it at $29, but with a game like this, we might need the lower price-point.  But the lower price point could leave some buyers with the feeling that the game isn&rsquo;t worth the full price, and that somethings wrong with it.  Game players are always screaming about wanting lower prices, but the truth is, if you lower the price too far, people stop buying it (unless it&rsquo;s a high profile game).</p>\n<p>155,000 or 75,000 units doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but our publisher is not in business to break-even, we&rsquo;re probably going to need to sell two or three times that.  Not every game we do is going to be a success, no matter how hard we try and how good we are.  If we&rsquo;re going to push some creative boundaries, we&rsquo;re going to need to experiment, and that&rsquo;s going to mean some failures.  We need to make a lot more then just break-even.  A publisher or investor is going to look at spending a dollar on this verses spending a dollar on something else.  This has to be a compelling option for them.  Break-even is not compelling.</p>\n<p><a href="http://people.freenet.de/lucasfangames/maniac/games_eng.htm">Maniac Mansion Deluxe</a>, the fan remake of Maniac Mansion, racked up over 200,000 downloads in a very short time, while it was free, it does show a strong interest.  How much of that was just &ldquo;nostalgia&rdquo; could be an important questions to answer.  How many of those people would spend $19 or $29 for a new game is another question I don&rsquo;t have the answer to.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at online distribution, after all, we are living in the futuristic year of 2004.</p>\n<h1 id="online-distribution">Online Distribution</h1>\n<p>Online has one big advantage:  It cuts out the middle-man, allowing us to get the full retail price of the game.  Online also has one big disadvantage: it cuts out the middle-man.  Having the game sit on a store shelf gets it in front of people eyes, it also gives it this sense of legitimacy, like a hardcover book does in the book publishing business.  The perception of shelf presence will vanish at some point, but it is a reality today.  There is a good reason why games like EverQuest are sold in stores and not exclusively online.</p>\n<p>If we only have an online presence, we need to do something to drive people to our website.  That&rsquo;s going to require more marketing, promotions, tie-ins, etc.  We can count on the buzz of our game being the first 2D point-n-click in fifty-years, but that is only in certain circles.  We need to reach beyond that.  It&rsquo;s also the kind of buzz that dies quickly.  If we plan on doing more than one game, we need some kind of sustainable way to get people back to our site.</p>\n<p>The issues surrounding marketing are not unique to online sales, just complicated by it being new and different.</p>\n<p>Online distribution is also not free.  Bandwidth costs money.  If we plan on the game being successful, we need servers and bandwidth able to handle huge simultaneous downloads.   With all the animation, voice, music, graft, etc, we could approach 1GB.  Nothing will kill our sales faster than willing customers that are unable to download the game at a reasonable speed.  Research I did several years ago into online distribution showed that, allowing for peak usage, bandwidth cost could run $5 per download.  A lot might have changed since then.  It was at the peak of the dot.com thingy.</p>\n<p>No doubt, someone will bring up BitTorrent and other P2P systems as a method of distribution.  Assuming that our purchasing model can deal with it, it is a good alternate way to get the game to people, but does it really hit all the people we want to be buying the game?  If we&rsquo;re trying to hit a broader audience, we need a fast, simple and direct way for them to download our game.</p>\n<p>System like Steam and even custom BitTorrent clients are very real possibilities, but they are risky and untested and will cost is time and money.  Publishers and investors don&rsquo;t like risk.  They are already taking a big one on the game, the fewer risky parts to our plan the better.</p>\n<p>With online distribution there are also issues with accepting credit cards, dealing with returns, unhappy customers, copy protection, unlock keys, graft, etc, etc, etc.</p>\n<p>We will also have to overcome the &ldquo;everything is free on the internet&rdquo; mentality.  Many companies have - so it&rsquo;s far from insurmountable - but it is an issue that needs to be considered.  Piracy is also a huge problem.  When you have a main-stream product, be it a game, music or a movie, you are some-what insulated from piracy because of high volume.  When you&rsquo;re dealing with a nitch market - like a 2D point-n-click would be - you are much more susceptible to the negative effects of piracy due to the smaller market and lower volume.</p>\n<p>Finding an online publisher would solve some of these problems (or shift them to someone more equipped to deal with them), but I have yet to find a online publisher willing to spend the kind of money we&rsquo;re needing for an online distributed game of this scale.  They are very much in the mindset of small webish games for the casual gamer.  In contrast, conventional publishers are used to spending larger sums of money on games.</p>\n<p>Online distribution seems great until you start to really look into it.  It&rsquo;s rife with issues, but shouldn&rsquo;t be discounted.  At the end of the day, we&rsquo;d probably settle on some of both.</p>\n<p>The last issue is developer royalties.</p>\n<h1 id="developer-royalties">Developer Royalties</h1>\n<p>If we go with a publisher, we are going to get a cut of the wholesale price.  We&rsquo;ll assume a rate of 20%.  It is also typical for the developer to recoup the development costs before any real money is paid out.  What is recoupment and how is it calculated?</p>\n<p>As a developer, we are &ldquo;loaned&rdquo; the money to build the game, in our case $950,000 (most publishers do not bill the developer for marketing, some do).  We need to pay that money back to the publisher.  When the game is sold, we get our 20% of the Wholesale price, but we have to pay back our loan, so we won&rsquo;t get any money until our royalties have reached $950,000.</p>\n<p>To calculate the developers break-even, we take the $950,000 we &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; and divide that by 20% of the wholesale price.  So for the developer to start making money, the game needs to sell the following units at each price point:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Developer break even units 320,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Developer break even units 220,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Developer break even units 160,000</strong></p>\n<p>Double Hmmmm&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Whether the whole developer royalty model is fair or not is not the point of this article, so let&rsquo;s not get side-tracked on that.  It&rsquo;s the way the industry works, and we&rsquo;ll have to live with it until the armed revolution of 2007.  As the date approaches, keep checking this site for instructions.</p>\n<h2 id="some-final-thoughts">Some final thoughts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember, this thought-experiment was about building a modern 2D adventure game in today&rsquo;s market.  There are a lot of other styles of games that can be made cheaper.  Stay focused.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of issues and sub-issues I have not talked about, or only briefly touch upon, so this should not be used as anything other than a conversation starter.</li>\n<li>There are an endless number of cheap ways to do marketing and ways to cut development cost.  If this was a real business plan, all those would be thoroughly thought through.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of alternate distribution models that we could explore beyond the traditional retail sales and emerging online.  We could do it as shareware, advertising funded, bundled with cereal, etc.  The list is endless, but they are also risky and unlikely to get us the funding to build the game.  For this thought experiment, we&rsquo;re trying to build a viable business likely to get funding from an investor or publisher.</li>\n<li>Anyone attempting this is going to have to find a publisher (or become a publisher) that is willing to put out several games before evaluating the success of the venture.  It&rsquo;s going to take a few really good games before this catches on.  If our publisher (or we) gives up after an initial failure, it will never succeed.  A longer term vision is needed.</li>\n<li>We need to expand the audience beyond the current 2D adventure fan base.  While this is a large and dedicated group, it needs to be larger and growing.  We need to appeal (with the game and the marketing) to a new set of people who are not exclusively interested in high-testosterone 3D gaming.  Games like Grim Fandango had a very wide appeal, but were miss-marketed and abandoned to quickly.</li>\n<li>We should build a Mac and possibly a Linux version of the game.  We need every channel we can get.  Linux poses some problems (perceptionally and technically), but they are worth solving.  I have not thought a lot about the Linux issues, they might be simple.</li>\n<li>We&rsquo;re going to need to come up with truly innovative stories and modern game play.  We can&rsquo;t just mimic the adventure games of the past.  We have some huge graphic perceptions to overcome, at least as a first impression.  Everyone talks about game-play being king.  We would need to prove it.</li>\n<li>We should think about a licensed property, but the economics of it probably don&rsquo;t make any sense.  And it&rsquo;s not as much fun.</li>\n<li>There is not going to be a lot of profit on the back-end.  While we do need to build a viable business, in the end of the day, it&rsquo;s got to be something we love, because it&rsquo;s not going to be much more than a paycheck.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fun to think about&hellip;</p>\n<p>Now everyone back to the salt-mines&hellip;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<h3 id="note-i-wrote-this-in-2004-in-the-days-before-steam-and-kickstarter-but-most-of-it-is-still-applicable-but-a-lot-has-also-changed">Note: I wrote this in 2004. In the days before Steam and Kickstarter, but most of it is still applicable, but a lot has also changed.</h3>\n<p>Someone recently submitted a question asking what it would take to build a classic 2D point-n-click adventure today and would it be a viable business?  The internet is filled with classic adventure fan sites centered around the LucasArts and Sierra games and a common thread is always how much people would like to see new ones being made, and why isn&rsquo;t it being done.</p>\n<p>These are interesting questions that I&rsquo;ve ponder a lot in the last year, but never really looked into it in any detail.</p>\n<p>Now, before I launch into this long stream-of-consciousness, there are a couple of important things to understand.  First, this is only a thought experiment.  This is not something I am planning on doing, or even have a huge interest in doing, so please don&rsquo;t feed the rumor mills.  Second, this article contains gory and gruesome details about the games business and, in particular, marketing and distribution.  If you&rsquo;d rather remain blissfully oblivious to the horrors of what goes on behind the scenes, this is the place to stop reading.  If you&rsquo;re one of those people that can&rsquo;t help but stare at a car accident, read on.</p>\n<p>For this exercise, I am going to make a few assumptions.</p>\n<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>\n<h3 id="1-were-building-a-classic-2d-point-n-click-adventure-game">1) We&rsquo;re building a classic 2D point-n-click adventure game.</h3>\n<p>Building the game in 3D is a much more costly endeavor that brings with it a whole slew of complications which I won&rsquo;t get in to in this article.  The goal here is a class point-n-click adventure.</p>\n<h3 id="2-were-hiring-real-employees-to-build-the-game">2) We&rsquo;re hiring real employees to build the game.</h3>\n<p>Clearly, the game could be done cheaper with hobbyists or people passionate enough about the genre to work for free or below cost, for back-end, or with a trust-fund baby on staff, but the goal in putting together this plan is to explore it as real business, and our business model is a little screwed if we count on people working for free.  Also, given that deadlines will become important, it&rsquo;s necessary to have everyone&rsquo;s full attention and nothing says that better then a paycheck, except maybe a cattle-prod, but that might be illegal.  I&rsquo;d have to check.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to hire the best people possible.  This is not a diss to the hobbyist market, there are some very talented people out there, but we&rsquo;ll need our team all in one place and not working at other jobs or going to school.  If you&rsquo;re an unemployed adventure game developer hobbyist, please contact our fictional company for a fictional job interview.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also assuming we have to pay competitive wages, and most of my pay information comes from the Seattle area, so we&rsquo;ll use that data for now.  It&rsquo;s probably more expensive in the Bay Area, but cheaper in India.</p>\n<h3 id="3-were-going-to-focus-on-the-development-and-product-related-costs-only">3) We&rsquo;re going to focus on the development and product related costs only.</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of other overhead in running a company, even a small developer, we&rsquo;ll ignore those.  There are also huge costs associated being a publisher, like marketing, sales, distribution, graft, etc.  We&rsquo;ll ignore these for now, but touch on them later on the article.</p>\n<h3 id="4-the-engine-technology-is-not-included-in-the-costs">4) The engine technology is not included in the costs.</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of 2D engines out there that will do what we need, so we&rsquo;ll just assume we&rsquo;re using one of those.  I realize that many of them are Open Source, which could complicate or help our situation.  I&rsquo;m going to call it a wash and ignore the whole situation for now.  Trust me, It&rsquo;s not that hard to get your hands on a good solid 2D engine for next to nothing.</p>\n<h3 id="5-the-game-is-state-of-the-art-as-far-as-2d-goes">5) The game is state-of-the-art, as far as 2D goes.</h3>\n<p>Yeah, I know.  The last time you read state-of-the-art and 2D in the same sentence was back in the early 90&rsquo;s.  The game will be fully animated and include wall-to-wall original music and full voice.  No corners will be cut in the quality of the production.</p>\n<p>Although some styles of art might be cheaper to produce than others, I don&rsquo;t think the savings is going to be dramatic.  We might want to go with a pre-rendered 3D look rather then the traditional 2D animation found in a lot of 2D adventure games.  Doing pre-rendered 3D might be a little more expensive because the tools tended to cost a lot, and 3D animators (as a rule) can be more expensive.  People argue that you end up saving because it&rsquo;s easier to animate once you have the models built, but I have not seen this to be true, but my experience is a little limited in this area.</p>\n<h3 id="6-were-going-to-build-the-game-in-a-year">6) We&rsquo;re going to build the game in a year.</h3>\n<p>For a classic point-n-click adventure, this is aggressive, but should be doable.  Monkey Island took less than a year.  We&rsquo;ll need a lot more art, but that&rsquo;s a production issue and can easily be made up for with more people to a certain extent.  We&rsquo;re also going to do a very rigorous pre-production, this will be essential in getting the game done on time and on budget.  Since we&rsquo;re dealing with known technology, this should be very predictable.</p>\n<h3 id="7-were-using-an-established-publisher-for-the-game-and-not-self-publishing">7) We&rsquo;re using an established publisher for the game, and not self-publishing.</h3>\n<p>Starting a company that will self-publish the game into retail channels is a huge undertaking and would require some significant capital.  Not impossible, but we&rsquo;d need money beyond the cost of development, and that is a whole different business plan.  It&rsquo;s also hard to become a retail based publisher with a single game.  You need several games to have any clout with the retailers.  We could do a distribution deal, but then we&rsquo;re significantly cutting into our profit.  As the last two sentences suggest, we&rsquo;re also assuming in-store distribution, online distribution will be covered later.</p>\n<h3 id="8-its-a-pc-game">8) It&rsquo;s a PC game</h3>\n<p>Dealing with the console manufactures on something like this would be a nightmare, plus the royalties you pay to them would kill us with a nitch game like this and it&rsquo;s just not the venue for these types of games.  At least not to start.</p>\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s roll up our sleeves, pull out our slide-rules and get down to business.</p>\n<h2 id="development-costs-and-plan">Development costs and plan</h2>\n<p>Staffing is the main expense, and is always a hotly debated topic.  Everyone has an opinion, and I&rsquo;m sure this will be no different.  Until a complete pre-production is done, it&rsquo;s hard to nail this cost down.  These figures are based on my experience building adventures at Humongous Entertainment and at my last company Hulabee Entertainment.  We probably built more 2D graphic adventure games than any other company in the world and we had a finely tuned production process.  Granted, these games were for kids, but that only affects the scope of the project.  If you&rsquo;ve ever played any of those games, you will understand what I mean.</p>\n<p>Remember, not everyone on this list would be on the project for the entire 12 months.  This creates some complications because you need to keep people around to ensure a skilled staff for the next game.  Hopefully we could get two games going in such a way that people would be moved off one project onto another.  One advantage the movie business has is an infrastructure to deal with production people coming and going from projects.  In the game business we don&rsquo;t have that.  But, I&rsquo;m going to ignore this issue for now.  We&rsquo;ll assume there are other projects to keep people busy and there is no down-time.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also going to assume the design and creative lead is either the lead programmer, lead artist, or both.</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer (will also deal with engine issues)\nLead Artist\nProducer</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $220,000</strong></p>\n<p>3 Programmers (in the scripting language)<br />\n5 Artists (skilled in 2D animation)\\</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $480,000</strong></p>\n<p>Testing</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $30,000</strong></p>\n<p>Other expenses that will be contracted out:</p>\n<p>Script\nMusic<br />\nSound<br />\nVoice talent (non-union)<br />\nVoice recording</p>\n<p><strong>Subtotal: $60,000</strong></p>\n<p>The total cost for a 12 month project - including a standard 20% overhead for insurance, taxes, graft, paper-clips and a little rounding up - comes to:</p>\n<p><strong>Project Development Total: $950,000</strong></p>\n<p>Now, we can argue all day about how much we&rsquo;re paying people, whether someone is over or under payed, etc.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  My defense is that this comes from my direct experience in hiring people to do the exact same jobs.  We can certainly save some money by hiring talented people with no experience, and that often works very well, but I&rsquo;m assuming that at least half the people are experienced in the business.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve kept the team pretty lean.  It would be easy to dump the Producer, but that would be a huge mistake.  A good and talented Producer is gold.  We can also save a little money if the script or music is done by someone already on the team, but that will take them away from their other job and you have to ask yourself:  are they really the best person for the task?</p>\n<p>This cost is also just for development.  If we&rsquo;re going to fully evaluate the prospects of a 2D point-n-click adventure in today&rsquo;s market, we need to think about marketing costs on top of development.  Even if we use an established publisher, we&rsquo;re going to need to include this in order to evaluate the ROI (return on investment) that a publisher is going to look at.</p>\n<h2 id="marketing-costs">Marketing Costs</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s assume marketing costs comes in at $500,000.  This figure is probably about half of what it should be.  We can&rsquo;t just take out full page ads in the game rags and pepper the gaming sites with banner ads.  We&rsquo;re going to need a good solid grass-roots campaign.  If we&rsquo;re really clever we could get away with a number like this.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon to spend as much on marketing as it cost to develop the game.  The marketing budgets for mainstream console games reach $10 million and more, but since we&rsquo;re not doing console, we save the drain of TV ads.  We can also be clever with our PR and get the marketing costs down as much as possible.  Lots of PR will go a long way on the initial game, but once the novelty wears off (and competition begins), we&rsquo;ll have to spend marketing money.   As sad as it is, the best games don&rsquo;t always sell just because they are good.  It takes good marketing to be successful.  Never underestimate good marketing.</p>\n<p>One big area of concern here is if we&rsquo;re going through a publisher, we&rsquo;re going to have to rely on them being clever with marketing and PR.  That&rsquo;s a big risk.  Most publisher try and fit everything into a template.  We&rsquo;re going to need a publisher that is willing to think differently about this.  It&rsquo;s an important trait to be looking for as we hunt for a publisher.  But, as anyone who is pitching a 2D adventure game today will tell you, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of choices.</p>\n<p>I see this as the single-most risky part of this venture.</p>\n<p>For the first part of this evaluation, we&rsquo;re going to assume we&rsquo;re going through retail distribution.  In reality, this is the most likely scenario.  But more on that later.</p>\n<h1 id="retail-distribution">Retail Distribution</h1>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll do that math for three different price points, $19, $29 and $39.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s realistic to assume a $49 price.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure this is obvious to most everyone, but I&rsquo;ll point it out anyway.  The publisher does not get the full retail price of the game.  The stores have to make a profit as well.  The publisher sells the game to the retailer for what&rsquo;s called the Wholesale price.  The store can then sell the game for whatever they want, but for the most part, they use the following numbers:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Wholesale $15</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Wholesale $22</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Wholesale $30</strong></p>\n<p>There is also MDF (Marketing Development Funds) and co-op charges that the publisher needs to pay the retailer, and those typically run 6% of the Wholesale price billed quarterly, net of returns.  These cost go to cover in-store advertising, news-paper circulars, etc.  In addition, publishers also pay to have their games on &ldquo;end-caps&rdquo; or have special &ldquo;shelf-talkers&rdquo; (they don&rsquo;t really talk, thank-god, but I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s coming) that helps point out the product.  General rule of thumb is: if there is anything in the store that calls any attention to the game, it was paid for by the publisher.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll assume we&rsquo;re not going to pay for anything beyond the required co-op and MDF, but it might be a wise investment to buy some better placement.</p>\n<p>We also have the cost of the box, CD, manual, shipping, graft, etc.  This is called Cost of Goods, or COGs for short.  This will typically be $1.50 unless we want to throw some cool extra stuff in the box like we used to do in the olden-days.  Could be a good idea for the initial launch, if so, we&rsquo;ll bill that to marketing.</p>\n<p>There are also fees for outside sales commissions, distribution, EDI (electronic inventory management), inventory management, field merchandising, etc.  This will add another $1 to the cost of our game.</p>\n<p>We need to assume that we&rsquo;re going to get returns.  These might come from damaged product, customer returns, or games that the just don&rsquo;t sell.  We have to account for this, it&rsquo;s typically 20%.  As a side note, next time a store tells you they can&rsquo;t take a game back because the publisher won&rsquo;t take it back, call bullshit.  Of course, it&rsquo;s not as simple as the publisher giving the money back, it&rsquo;s typically done as credit, and it&rsquo;s often negotiated with respect to new games being bought from the publisher.  It is one of the reason that a single game publisher is going to have a hard time.</p>\n<p>So after all this, plus a little rounding, we&rsquo;re down to the following profit:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Profit $9</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Profit $18</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Profit $25</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s now time to calculate our break-even point.  That is the point that our publisher has made all their money back.  To do this, we divide the total cost of the project by the profit at each price-point.</p>\n<p>Our game cost $1,400,000 to build and (minimally) market, so to break-even we need to sell the following units at each price-point:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Break even units 155,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Break even units 75,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Break even units 56,000</strong></p>\n<p>Hmmmm&hellip;.</p>\n<p>There is quite a jump from the $19 to the $29 price point.  It will be tempting to try and sell it at $29, but with a game like this, we might need the lower price-point.  But the lower price point could leave some buyers with the feeling that the game isn&rsquo;t worth the full price, and that somethings wrong with it.  Game players are always screaming about wanting lower prices, but the truth is, if you lower the price too far, people stop buying it (unless it&rsquo;s a high profile game).</p>\n<p>155,000 or 75,000 units doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but our publisher is not in business to break-even, we&rsquo;re probably going to need to sell two or three times that.  Not every game we do is going to be a success, no matter how hard we try and how good we are.  If we&rsquo;re going to push some creative boundaries, we&rsquo;re going to need to experiment, and that&rsquo;s going to mean some failures.  We need to make a lot more then just break-even.  A publisher or investor is going to look at spending a dollar on this verses spending a dollar on something else.  This has to be a compelling option for them.  Break-even is not compelling.</p>\n<p><a href="http://people.freenet.de/lucasfangames/maniac/games_eng.htm">Maniac Mansion Deluxe</a>, the fan remake of Maniac Mansion, racked up over 200,000 downloads in a very short time, while it was free, it does show a strong interest.  How much of that was just &ldquo;nostalgia&rdquo; could be an important questions to answer.  How many of those people would spend $19 or $29 for a new game is another question I don&rsquo;t have the answer to.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at online distribution, after all, we are living in the futuristic year of 2004.</p>\n<h1 id="online-distribution">Online Distribution</h1>\n<p>Online has one big advantage:  It cuts out the middle-man, allowing us to get the full retail price of the game.  Online also has one big disadvantage: it cuts out the middle-man.  Having the game sit on a store shelf gets it in front of people eyes, it also gives it this sense of legitimacy, like a hardcover book does in the book publishing business.  The perception of shelf presence will vanish at some point, but it is a reality today.  There is a good reason why games like EverQuest are sold in stores and not exclusively online.</p>\n<p>If we only have an online presence, we need to do something to drive people to our website.  That&rsquo;s going to require more marketing, promotions, tie-ins, etc.  We can count on the buzz of our game being the first 2D point-n-click in fifty-years, but that is only in certain circles.  We need to reach beyond that.  It&rsquo;s also the kind of buzz that dies quickly.  If we plan on doing more than one game, we need some kind of sustainable way to get people back to our site.</p>\n<p>The issues surrounding marketing are not unique to online sales, just complicated by it being new and different.</p>\n<p>Online distribution is also not free.  Bandwidth costs money.  If we plan on the game being successful, we need servers and bandwidth able to handle huge simultaneous downloads.   With all the animation, voice, music, graft, etc, we could approach 1GB.  Nothing will kill our sales faster than willing customers that are unable to download the game at a reasonable speed.  Research I did several years ago into online distribution showed that, allowing for peak usage, bandwidth cost could run $5 per download.  A lot might have changed since then.  It was at the peak of the dot.com thingy.</p>\n<p>No doubt, someone will bring up BitTorrent and other P2P systems as a method of distribution.  Assuming that our purchasing model can deal with it, it is a good alternate way to get the game to people, but does it really hit all the people we want to be buying the game?  If we&rsquo;re trying to hit a broader audience, we need a fast, simple and direct way for them to download our game.</p>\n<p>System like Steam and even custom BitTorrent clients are very real possibilities, but they are risky and untested and will cost is time and money.  Publishers and investors don&rsquo;t like risk.  They are already taking a big one on the game, the fewer risky parts to our plan the better.</p>\n<p>With online distribution there are also issues with accepting credit cards, dealing with returns, unhappy customers, copy protection, unlock keys, graft, etc, etc, etc.</p>\n<p>We will also have to overcome the &ldquo;everything is free on the internet&rdquo; mentality.  Many companies have - so it&rsquo;s far from insurmountable - but it is an issue that needs to be considered.  Piracy is also a huge problem.  When you have a main-stream product, be it a game, music or a movie, you are some-what insulated from piracy because of high volume.  When you&rsquo;re dealing with a nitch market - like a 2D point-n-click would be - you are much more susceptible to the negative effects of piracy due to the smaller market and lower volume.</p>\n<p>Finding an online publisher would solve some of these problems (or shift them to someone more equipped to deal with them), but I have yet to find a online publisher willing to spend the kind of money we&rsquo;re needing for an online distributed game of this scale.  They are very much in the mindset of small webish games for the casual gamer.  In contrast, conventional publishers are used to spending larger sums of money on games.</p>\n<p>Online distribution seems great until you start to really look into it.  It&rsquo;s rife with issues, but shouldn&rsquo;t be discounted.  At the end of the day, we&rsquo;d probably settle on some of both.</p>\n<p>The last issue is developer royalties.</p>\n<h1 id="developer-royalties">Developer Royalties</h1>\n<p>If we go with a publisher, we are going to get a cut of the wholesale price.  We&rsquo;ll assume a rate of 20%.  It is also typical for the developer to recoup the development costs before any real money is paid out.  What is recoupment and how is it calculated?</p>\n<p>As a developer, we are &ldquo;loaned&rdquo; the money to build the game, in our case $950,000 (most publishers do not bill the developer for marketing, some do).  We need to pay that money back to the publisher.  When the game is sold, we get our 20% of the Wholesale price, but we have to pay back our loan, so we won&rsquo;t get any money until our royalties have reached $950,000.</p>\n<p>To calculate the developers break-even, we take the $950,000 we &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; and divide that by 20% of the wholesale price.  So for the developer to start making money, the game needs to sell the following units at each price point:</p>\n<p><strong>Retail $19 = Developer break even units 320,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $29 = Developer break even units 220,000</strong><br />\n<strong>Retail $39 = Developer break even units 160,000</strong></p>\n<p>Double Hmmmm&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Whether the whole developer royalty model is fair or not is not the point of this article, so let&rsquo;s not get side-tracked on that.  It&rsquo;s the way the industry works, and we&rsquo;ll have to live with it until the armed revolution of 2007.  As the date approaches, keep checking this site for instructions.</p>\n<h2 id="some-final-thoughts">Some final thoughts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember, this thought-experiment was about building a modern 2D adventure game in today&rsquo;s market.  There are a lot of other styles of games that can be made cheaper.  Stay focused.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of issues and sub-issues I have not talked about, or only briefly touch upon, so this should not be used as anything other than a conversation starter.</li>\n<li>There are an endless number of cheap ways to do marketing and ways to cut development cost.  If this was a real business plan, all those would be thoroughly thought through.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of alternate distribution models that we could explore beyond the traditional retail sales and emerging online.  We could do it as shareware, advertising funded, bundled with cereal, etc.  The list is endless, but they are also risky and unlikely to get us the funding to build the game.  For this thought experiment, we&rsquo;re trying to build a viable business likely to get funding from an investor or publisher.</li>\n<li>Anyone attempting this is going to have to find a publisher (or become a publisher) that is willing to put out several games before evaluating the success of the venture.  It&rsquo;s going to take a few really good games before this catches on.  If our publisher (or we) gives up after an initial failure, it will never succeed.  A longer term vision is needed.</li>\n<li>We need to expand the audience beyond the current 2D adventure fan base.  While this is a large and dedicated group, it needs to be larger and growing.  We need to appeal (with the game and the marketing) to a new set of people who are not exclusively interested in high-testosterone 3D gaming.  Games like Grim Fandango had a very wide appeal, but were miss-marketed and abandoned to quickly.</li>\n<li>We should build a Mac and possibly a Linux version of the game.  We need every channel we can get.  Linux poses some problems (perceptionally and technically), but they are worth solving.  I have not thought a lot about the Linux issues, they might be simple.</li>\n<li>We&rsquo;re going to need to come up with truly innovative stories and modern game play.  We can&rsquo;t just mimic the adventure games of the past.  We have some huge graphic perceptions to overcome, at least as a first impression.  Everyone talks about game-play being king.  We would need to prove it.</li>\n<li>We should think about a licensed property, but the economics of it probably don&rsquo;t make any sense.  And it&rsquo;s not as much fun.</li>\n<li>There is not going to be a lot of profit on the back-end.  While we do need to build a viable business, in the end of the day, it&rsquo;s got to be something we love, because it&rsquo;s not going to be much more than a paycheck.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fun to think about&hellip;</p>\n<p>Now everyone back to the salt-mines&hellip;</p>'}}

It is now the futuristic year of 2004 and we are all driving around in flying cars and wearing sliver jumps suits.  A lot has changed for Adventure Games as well, but unfortunately not in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Adventure Games are officially dead.  I think this <a href="http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/77.html">article from Old Man Murray</a> (written in 2002) sums it up pretty well.  Make sure you read the whole thing, it starts out slow, but his conclusion could not be more true.</p>\n<p>Some people will tell you that Adventure Games aren&rsquo;t really dead, they have just morphed into other forms, or that other genres have absorbed Adventure Games.  If this is true, they&rsquo;ve done a pretty bad job of it.</p>\n<p>I wrote this article to help fellow Adventure Games designers back in 1989, but the RPG, FPS and RTS designers of 2004 could use a little of the self-proclaimed wisdom of the past.</p>\n<p>As I read this some 15 years later, I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with everything in here anymore.  I learned a lot from Monkey Island 1 and 2, plus countless kids Adventure Games at Humongous Entertainment.  At some point in the near future, I will do an annotated version of this article, talking about things that have changed, or were just plains wrong.  But in the meantime, there is something interesting on TV right now.</p>\n<p>I would also like to thank <a href="http://electriceggplant.com">David Fox</a> for passively-aggressively forcing me to post this.</p>\n<h2 id="why-adventure-games-suck-and-what-we-can-do-about-it">Why Adventure Games Suck And What We Can Do About It</h2>\n<p>Copyright 1989, Ron Gilbert</p>\n<p>Of all the different types of games, the ones I most enjoy playing are adventure/story games.  It is no surprise that this is also the genre for which I design.  I enjoy games in which the pace is slow and the reward is for thinking and figuring, rather than quick reflexes.  The element that brings adventure games to life for me is the stories around which they are woven.  When done right, it is a form of storytelling that can be engrossing in a way that only interaction can bring.  The key here is &ldquo;done right&rdquo;, which it seldom is.</p>\n<p>One of my pet peeves is the recent trend to call story games &ldquo;Interactive Movies.&rdquo;  They are interactive, but they are not movies.  The fact that people want to call them movies just points out how lost we are.  What we need to do is to establish a genre for our works that we can call our own.  Movies came from stage plays, but the references are long lost and movies have come into their own.  The same thing needs to happen to story games.</p>\n<p>The desire to call them Interactive Movies comes from a couple of places.  The first is Marketing.  It is the goal of narrow-minded marketing to place everything into a category so it will be recognizable.  These people feel that the closest things to story games are movies.  The other source for the name Interactive Movie is what I call &ldquo;Hollywood Envy.&rdquo;  A great number of people in this business secretly (and not so secretly) wish they were making movies, not writing video games.  Knock it off!  If you really want to make movies, then go to film school and leave the game designing to people who want to make games.</p>\n<p>Story games are not movies, but the two forms do share a great deal.  It is not fair to completely ignore movies.  We can learn a lot from them about telling stories in a visual medium.  However, it is important to realize that there are many more differences than similarities.  We have to choose what to borrow and what to discover for ourselves.</p>\n<p>The single biggest difference is interaction.  You can&rsquo;t interact with a movie.  You just sit in the theater and watch it.  In a story game, the player is given the freedom to explore the story.  But the player doesn&rsquo;t always do what the designer intended, and this causes problems.  It is hard to create a cohesive plot when you have no idea what part of the story the player will trip over next.  This problem calls for a special kind of storytelling, and we have just begun to scratch the surface of this art form.</p>\n<p>There is a state of mind called &ldquo;suspension of disbelief&rdquo;.  When you are watching a movie, or reading a good book, your mind falls into this state.  It occurs when you are pulled so completely into the story that you no longer realize you are in a movie theater or sitting at your couch, reading.  When the story starts to drag, or the plots begins to fall apart, the suspension of disbelief is lost.  You soon start looking around the theater, noticing the people in front of you or the green exit sign.  One way I judge a movie is by the number of times I realized I was in a theater.</p>\n<p>The same is true of story games (as well as almost all other kinds of games).  As the story builds, we are pulled into the game and leave the real world behind.  As designers, our job is to keep people in this state for as long as possible.  Every time the player has to restore a saved game, or pound his head on the desk in frustration, the suspension of disbelief is gone.  At this time he is most likely to shut off the computer and go watch TV, at which point we all have lost.</p>\n<p>I have created a set of rules of thumb that will minimize the loss of suspension of disbelief.  As with any set of rules, there are always exceptions.  In my designs, I hope that if these rules cannot be followed, it is for artistic reasons and not because I am too lazy to do it right.  In Maniac Mansion, in one place or another, I violated all but one of these rules.  Some of them were violated by design, others by sloppiness.  If I could redesign Maniac Mansion, all the violations would be removed and I&rsquo;d have a much better game.</p>\n<p>Some people say that following these rules makes the games too easy to play.  I disagree.  What makes most games tough to play is that the puzzles are arbitrary and unconnected.  Most are solved by chance or repetitive sessions of typing &ldquo;light candle with match&rdquo;, &ldquo;light paper with match&rdquo;, &ldquo;light rug with match&rdquo;, until something happens.  This is not tough game play, this is masturbation.  I played one game that required the player to drop a bubble gum wrapper in a room in order to get a trap door to open (object names have been changed to protect the guilty).  What is the reasoning?  There is none.  It&rsquo;s an advanced puzzle, I was told.</p>\n<p>Here, then, are Gilbert&rsquo;s Rules of Thumb:</p>\n<h2 id="end-objective-needs-to-be-clear">End objective needs to be clear</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s OK if the objective changes in mid-game, but at the beginning the player should have a clear vision as to what he or she is trying to accomplish.  Nothing is more frustrating than wandering around wondering what you should be doing and if what you have been doing is going to get you anywhere.  Situations where not knowing what&rsquo;s going on can be fun and an integral part of the game, but this is rare and difficult to pull off.</p>\n<h2 id="sub-goals-need-to-be-obvious">Sub-goals need to be obvious</h2>\n<p>Most good adventure games are broken up into many sub-goals.  Letting the player know at least the first sub-goal is essential in hooking them.  If the main goal is to rescue the prince, and the player is trapped on an island at the beginning of the game, have another character in the story tell them the first step: get off the island.  This is just good storytelling.  Ben Kenobi pretty much laid out Luke&rsquo;s whole journey in the first twenty minutes of Star Wars.  This provided a way for the audience to follow the progress of the main character.  For someone not used to the repetitive head-banging of adventure games, this simple clue can mean the difference between finishing the game and giving up after the first hour.  It&rsquo;s very easy when designing to become blind to what the player doesn&rsquo;t know about your story.</p>\n<h2 id="live-and-learn">Live and learn</h2>\n<p>As a rule, adventure games should be able to be played from beginning to end without &ldquo;dying&rdquo; or saving the game if the player is very careful and very observant.  It is bad design to put puzzles and situations into a game that require a player to die in order to learn what not to do next time.  This is not to say that all death situations should be designed out.  Danger is inherent in drama, but danger should be survivable if the player is clever.</p>\n<p>As an exercise, take one complete path through a story game and then tell it to someone else, as if it were a standard story.  If you find places where the main character could not have known a piece of information that was used (the character who learned it died in a previous game), then there is a hole in the plot.</p>\n<h2 id="backwards-puzzles">Backwards Puzzles</h2>\n<p>The backwards puzzle is probably the one thing that bugs me more than anything else about adventure games.  I have created my share of them; and as with most design flaws, it&rsquo;s easier to leave them in than to redesign them.  The backwards puzzle occurs when the solution is found before the problem.  Ideally, the crevice should be found before the rope that allows the player to descend.  What this does in the player&rsquo;s mind is set up a challenge.  He knows he need to get down the crevice, but there is no route.  Now the player has a task in mind as he continues to search.  When a rope is spotted, a light goes on in his head and the puzzle falls into place.  For a player, when the design works, there is nothing like that experience.</p>\n<h2 id="i-forgot-to-pick-it-up">I forgot to pick it up</h2>\n<p>This is really part of the backwards puzzle rule, but in the worst way.  Never require a player to pick up an item that is used later in the game if she can&rsquo;t go back and get it when it is needed.  It is very frustrating to learn that a seemingly insignificant object is needed, and the only way to get it is to start over or go back to a saved game.  From the player&rsquo;s point of view, there was no reason for picking it up in the first place.  Some designers have actually defended this practice by saying that, &ldquo;adventure games players know to pick up everything.&rdquo;  This is a cop-out.  If the jar of water needs to be used on the spaceship and it can only be found on the planet, create a use for it on the planet that guarantees it will be picked up.  If the time between the two uses is long enough, you can be almost guaranteed that the player forgot she even had the object.</p>\n<p>The other way around this problem is to give the player hints about what she might need to pick up.  If the aliens on the planet suggest that the player find water before returning to the ship, and the player ignores this advice, then failure is her own fault.</p>\n<h2 id="puzzles-should-advance-the-story">Puzzles should advance the story</h2>\n<p>There is nothing more frustrating than solving pointless puzzle after pointless puzzle.  Each puzzle solved should bring the player closer to understanding the story and game.  It should be somewhat clear how solving this puzzle brings the player closer to the immediate goal.  What a waste of time and energy for the designer and player if all the puzzle does is slow the progress of the game.</p>\n<h2 id="real-time-is-bad-drama">Real time is bad drama</h2>\n<p>One of the most important keys to drama is timing.  Anyone who has designed a story game knows that the player rarely does anything at the right time or in the right order.  If we let the game run on a clock that is independent from the player&rsquo;s actions, we are going to be guaranteed that few things will happen with dramatic timing.  When Indiana Jones rolled under the closing stone door and grabbed his hat just in time, it sent a chill and a cheer through everyone in the audience.  If that scene had been done in a standard adventure game, the player would have been killed the first four times he tried to make it under the door.  The next six times the player would have been too late to grab the hat.  Is this good drama?  Not likely.  The key is to use Hollywood time, not real time.  Give the player some slack when doing time-based puzzles.  Try to watch for intent.  If the player is working towards the solution and almost ready to complete it, wait.  Wait until the hat is grabbed, then slam the door down.  The player thinks they &ldquo;just made it&rdquo; and consequently a much greater number of players get the rush and excitement.  When designing time puzzles I like to divide the time into three categories.  10% of the players will do the puzzle so fast and efficiently that they will finish with time to spare.  Another 10% will take too much time and fail, which leaves 80% of the people to brush through in the nick of time.</p>\n<h2 id="incremental-reward">Incremental reward</h2>\n<p>The player needs to know that she is achieving.  The fastest way to turn a player off is to let the game drag on with no advancement.  This is especially true for people who are playing adventure games for the first time.  In graphics adventures the reward often comes in the form of seeing new areas of the game.  New graphics and characters are often all that is needed to keep people playing.  Of course, if we are trying to tell a story, then revealing new plot elements and twists can be of equal or greater value.</p>\n<h2 id="arbitrary-puzzles">Arbitrary puzzles</h2>\n<p>Puzzles and their solutions need to make sense.  They don&rsquo;t have to be obvious, just make sense.  The best reaction after solving a tough puzzle should be, &ldquo;Of course, why didn&rsquo;t I think of that sooner!&rdquo;  The worst, and most often heard after being told the solution is, &ldquo;I never would have gotten that!&rdquo;  If the solution can only be reached by trial and error or plain luck, it&rsquo;s a bad puzzle.</p>\n<h2 id="reward-intent">Reward Intent</h2>\n<p>The object of these games is to have fun.  Figure out what the player is trying to do.  If it is what the game wants, then help the player along and let it happen.  The most common place this fails is in playing a meta-game called &ldquo;second guess the parser.&rdquo;  If there is an object on the screen that looks like a box, but the parser is waiting for it to be called a mailbox, the player is going to spend a lot of time trying to get the game to do a task that should be transparent.  In parser-driven games, the key is to have lots of synonyms for objects.  If the game is a graphics adventure, check proximity of the player&rsquo;s character.  If the player is standing right next to something, chances are they are trying to manipulate it.  If you give the player the benefit of the doubt, the game will be right more than wrong.  On one occasion, I don&rsquo;t know how much time I spent trying to tie a string on the end of a stick.  I finally gave up, not knowing if I was wording the sentence wrong or if it was not part of the design.  As it turned out, I was wording it wrong.</p>\n<h2 id="unconnected-events">Unconnected events</h2>\n<p>In order to pace events, some games lock out sections until certain events have happened.  There is nothing wrong with this, it is almost a necessity.  The problem comes when the event that opens the new section of the world is unconnected.  If the designer wants to make sure that six objects have been picked up before opening a secret door, make sure that there is a reason why those six objects would affect the door.  If a player has only picked up five of the objects and is waiting for the door to open (or worse yet, trying to find a way to open the door), the act of getting the flashlight is not going to make any sense in relation to the door opening.</p>\n<h2 id="give-the-player-options">Give the player options</h2>\n<p>A lot of story games employ a technique that can best be described as caging the player.  This occurs when the player is required to solve a small set of puzzles in order to advance to the next section of the game, at which point she is presented with another small set of puzzles.  Once these puzzles are solved, in a seemingly endless series of cages, the player enters the next section.  This can be particularly frustrating if the player is unable to solve a particular puzzle.  The areas to explore tend to be small, so the only activity is walking around trying to find the one solution out.</p>\n<p>Try to imagine this type of puzzle as a cage the player is caught in, and the only way out is to find the key.  Once the key is found, the player finds herself in another cage.  A better way to approach designing this is to think of the player as outside the cages, and the puzzles as locked up within.  In this model, the player has a lot more options about what to do next.  She can select from a wide variety of cages to open.  If the solution to one puzzle stumps her, she can go on to another, thus increasing the amount of useful activity going on.</p>\n<p>Of course, you will want some puzzles that lock out areas of the game, but the areas should be fairly large and interesting unto themselves.  A good indicator of the cage syndrome is how linear the game is.  If the plot follows a very strict line, chances are the designer is caging the player along the path.  It&rsquo;s not easy to uncage a game, it requires some careful attention to the plot as seen from players coming at the story from different directions.  The easiest way is to create different interactions for a given situation depending on the order encountered.</p>\n<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If I could change the world, there are a few things I would do, and quite frankly none of them have anything to do with computers or games.  But since this article is about games?</p>\n<p>The first thing I&rsquo;d do is get rid of save games.  If there have to be save games, I would use them only when it was time to quit playing until the next day.  Save games should not be a part of game play.  This leads to sloppy design.  As a challenge, think about how you would design a game differently if there were no save games.  If you ever have the pleasure of watching a non-gameplayer playing an adventure game you will notice they treat save game very differently then the experienced user.  Some start using it as a defense mechanism only after being slapped in the face by the game a few times, the rest just stop playing.</p>\n<p>The second thing I&rsquo;d change would be the price.  For between forty and fifty dollars a game, people expect a lot of play for their money.  This rarely leads to huge, deep games, but rather time-wasting puzzles and mazes.  If the designer ever thinks the game might be too short, he throws in another puzzle or two.  These also tend to be the worst thought-out and most painful to solve.  If I could have my way, I&rsquo;d design games that were meant to be played in four to five hours.  The games would be of the same scope that I currently design, I&rsquo;d just remove the silly time-wasting puzzles and take the player for an intense ride.  The experience they would leave with would be much more entertaining and a lot less frustrating.  The games would still be challenging, but not at the expense of the players patience.</p>\n<p>If any type of game is going to bridge the gap between games and storytelling, it is most likely going to be adventure games.  They will become less puzzle solving and more story telling, it is the blueprint the future will be made from.  The thing we cannot forget is that we are here to entertain, and for most people, entertainment does not consist of nights and weekends filled with frustration.  The average American spends most of the day failing at the office, the last thing he wants to do is come home and fail while trying to relax and be entertained.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.grumpygamer.com/rss', 'value': '<img src="https://images-grumpygamer.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/IMG_1280.jpg" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote this back in 1989 while I was designing Monkey Island.  It is now the futuristic year of 2004 and we are all driving around in flying cars and wearing sliver jumps suits.  A lot has changed for Adventure Games as well, but unfortunately not in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Adventure Games are officially dead.  I think this <a href="http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/77.html">article from Old Man Murray</a> (written in 2002) sums it up pretty well.  Make sure you read the whole thing, it starts out slow, but his conclusion could not be more true.</p>\n<p>Some people will tell you that Adventure Games aren&rsquo;t really dead, they have just morphed into other forms, or that other genres have absorbed Adventure Games.  If this is true, they&rsquo;ve done a pretty bad job of it.</p>\n<p>I wrote this article to help fellow Adventure Games designers back in 1989, but the RPG, FPS and RTS designers of 2004 could use a little of the self-proclaimed wisdom of the past.</p>\n<p>As I read this some 15 years later, I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with everything in here anymore.  I learned a lot from Monkey Island 1 and 2, plus countless kids Adventure Games at Humongous Entertainment.  At some point in the near future, I will do an annotated version of this article, talking about things that have changed, or were just plains wrong.  But in the meantime, there is something interesting on TV right now.</p>\n<p>I would also like to thank <a href="http://electriceggplant.com">David Fox</a> for passively-aggressively forcing me to post this.</p>\n<h2 id="why-adventure-games-suck-and-what-we-can-do-about-it">Why Adventure Games Suck And What We Can Do About It</h2>\n<p>Copyright 1989, Ron Gilbert</p>\n<p>Of all the different types of games, the ones I most enjoy playing are adventure/story games.  It is no surprise that this is also the genre for which I design.  I enjoy games in which the pace is slow and the reward is for thinking and figuring, rather than quick reflexes.  The element that brings adventure games to life for me is the stories around which they are woven.  When done right, it is a form of storytelling that can be engrossing in a way that only interaction can bring.  The key here is &ldquo;done right&rdquo;, which it seldom is.</p>\n<p>One of my pet peeves is the recent trend to call story games &ldquo;Interactive Movies.&rdquo;  They are interactive, but they are not movies.  The fact that people want to call them movies just points out how lost we are.  What we need to do is to establish a genre for our works that we can call our own.  Movies came from stage plays, but the references are long lost and movies have come into their own.  The same thing needs to happen to story games.</p>\n<p>The desire to call them Interactive Movies comes from a couple of places.  The first is Marketing.  It is the goal of narrow-minded marketing to place everything into a category so it will be recognizable.  These people feel that the closest things to story games are movies.  The other source for the name Interactive Movie is what I call &ldquo;Hollywood Envy.&rdquo;  A great number of people in this business secretly (and not so secretly) wish they were making movies, not writing video games.  Knock it off!  If you really want to make movies, then go to film school and leave the game designing to people who want to make games.</p>\n<p>Story games are not movies, but the two forms do share a great deal.  It is not fair to completely ignore movies.  We can learn a lot from them about telling stories in a visual medium.  However, it is important to realize that there are many more differences than similarities.  We have to choose what to borrow and what to discover for ourselves.</p>\n<p>The single biggest difference is interaction.  You can&rsquo;t interact with a movie.  You just sit in the theater and watch it.  In a story game, the player is given the freedom to explore the story.  But the player doesn&rsquo;t always do what the designer intended, and this causes problems.  It is hard to create a cohesive plot when you have no idea what part of the story the player will trip over next.  This problem calls for a special kind of storytelling, and we have just begun to scratch the surface of this art form.</p>\n<p>There is a state of mind called &ldquo;suspension of disbelief&rdquo;.  When you are watching a movie, or reading a good book, your mind falls into this state.  It occurs when you are pulled so completely into the story that you no longer realize you are in a movie theater or sitting at your couch, reading.  When the story starts to drag, or the plots begins to fall apart, the suspension of disbelief is lost.  You soon start looking around the theater, noticing the people in front of you or the green exit sign.  One way I judge a movie is by the number of times I realized I was in a theater.</p>\n<p>The same is true of story games (as well as almost all other kinds of games).  As the story builds, we are pulled into the game and leave the real world behind.  As designers, our job is to keep people in this state for as long as possible.  Every time the player has to restore a saved game, or pound his head on the desk in frustration, the suspension of disbelief is gone.  At this time he is most likely to shut off the computer and go watch TV, at which point we all have lost.</p>\n<p>I have created a set of rules of thumb that will minimize the loss of suspension of disbelief.  As with any set of rules, there are always exceptions.  In my designs, I hope that if these rules cannot be followed, it is for artistic reasons and not because I am too lazy to do it right.  In Maniac Mansion, in one place or another, I violated all but one of these rules.  Some of them were violated by design, others by sloppiness.  If I could redesign Maniac Mansion, all the violations would be removed and I&rsquo;d have a much better game.</p>\n<p>Some people say that following these rules makes the games too easy to play.  I disagree.  What makes most games tough to play is that the puzzles are arbitrary and unconnected.  Most are solved by chance or repetitive sessions of typing &ldquo;light candle with match&rdquo;, &ldquo;light paper with match&rdquo;, &ldquo;light rug with match&rdquo;, until something happens.  This is not tough game play, this is masturbation.  I played one game that required the player to drop a bubble gum wrapper in a room in order to get a trap door to open (object names have been changed to protect the guilty).  What is the reasoning?  There is none.  It&rsquo;s an advanced puzzle, I was told.</p>\n<p>Here, then, are Gilbert&rsquo;s Rules of Thumb:</p>\n<h2 id="end-objective-needs-to-be-clear">End objective needs to be clear</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s OK if the objective changes in mid-game, but at the beginning the player should have a clear vision as to what he or she is trying to accomplish.  Nothing is more frustrating than wandering around wondering what you should be doing and if what you have been doing is going to get you anywhere.  Situations where not knowing what&rsquo;s going on can be fun and an integral part of the game, but this is rare and difficult to pull off.</p>\n<h2 id="sub-goals-need-to-be-obvious">Sub-goals need to be obvious</h2>\n<p>Most good adventure games are broken up into many sub-goals.  Letting the player know at least the first sub-goal is essential in hooking them.  If the main goal is to rescue the prince, and the player is trapped on an island at the beginning of the game, have another character in the story tell them the first step: get off the island.  This is just good storytelling.  Ben Kenobi pretty much laid out Luke&rsquo;s whole journey in the first twenty minutes of Star Wars.  This provided a way for the audience to follow the progress of the main character.  For someone not used to the repetitive head-banging of adventure games, this simple clue can mean the difference between finishing the game and giving up after the first hour.  It&rsquo;s very easy when designing to become blind to what the player doesn&rsquo;t know about your story.</p>\n<h2 id="live-and-learn">Live and learn</h2>\n<p>As a rule, adventure games should be able to be played from beginning to end without &ldquo;dying&rdquo; or saving the game if the player is very careful and very observant.  It is bad design to put puzzles and situations into a game that require a player to die in order to learn what not to do next time.  This is not to say that all death situations should be designed out.  Danger is inherent in drama, but danger should be survivable if the player is clever.</p>\n<p>As an exercise, take one complete path through a story game and then tell it to someone else, as if it were a standard story.  If you find places where the main character could not have known a piece of information that was used (the character who learned it died in a previous game), then there is a hole in the plot.</p>\n<h2 id="backwards-puzzles">Backwards Puzzles</h2>\n<p>The backwards puzzle is probably the one thing that bugs me more than anything else about adventure games.  I have created my share of them; and as with most design flaws, it&rsquo;s easier to leave them in than to redesign them.  The backwards puzzle occurs when the solution is found before the problem.  Ideally, the crevice should be found before the rope that allows the player to descend.  What this does in the player&rsquo;s mind is set up a challenge.  He knows he need to get down the crevice, but there is no route.  Now the player has a task in mind as he continues to search.  When a rope is spotted, a light goes on in his head and the puzzle falls into place.  For a player, when the design works, there is nothing like that experience.</p>\n<h2 id="i-forgot-to-pick-it-up">I forgot to pick it up</h2>\n<p>This is really part of the backwards puzzle rule, but in the worst way.  Never require a player to pick up an item that is used later in the game if she can&rsquo;t go back and get it when it is needed.  It is very frustrating to learn that a seemingly insignificant object is needed, and the only way to get it is to start over or go back to a saved game.  From the player&rsquo;s point of view, there was no reason for picking it up in the first place.  Some designers have actually defended this practice by saying that, &ldquo;adventure games players know to pick up everything.&rdquo;  This is a cop-out.  If the jar of water needs to be used on the spaceship and it can only be found on the planet, create a use for it on the planet that guarantees it will be picked up.  If the time between the two uses is long enough, you can be almost guaranteed that the player forgot she even had the object.</p>\n<p>The other way around this problem is to give the player hints about what she might need to pick up.  If the aliens on the planet suggest that the player find water before returning to the ship, and the player ignores this advice, then failure is her own fault.</p>\n<h2 id="puzzles-should-advance-the-story">Puzzles should advance the story</h2>\n<p>There is nothing more frustrating than solving pointless puzzle after pointless puzzle.  Each puzzle solved should bring the player closer to understanding the story and game.  It should be somewhat clear how solving this puzzle brings the player closer to the immediate goal.  What a waste of time and energy for the designer and player if all the puzzle does is slow the progress of the game.</p>\n<h2 id="real-time-is-bad-drama">Real time is bad drama</h2>\n<p>One of the most important keys to drama is timing.  Anyone who has designed a story game knows that the player rarely does anything at the right time or in the right order.  If we let the game run on a clock that is independent from the player&rsquo;s actions, we are going to be guaranteed that few things will happen with dramatic timing.  When Indiana Jones rolled under the closing stone door and grabbed his hat just in time, it sent a chill and a cheer through everyone in the audience.  If that scene had been done in a standard adventure game, the player would have been killed the first four times he tried to make it under the door.  The next six times the player would have been too late to grab the hat.  Is this good drama?  Not likely.  The key is to use Hollywood time, not real time.  Give the player some slack when doing time-based puzzles.  Try to watch for intent.  If the player is working towards the solution and almost ready to complete it, wait.  Wait until the hat is grabbed, then slam the door down.  The player thinks they &ldquo;just made it&rdquo; and consequently a much greater number of players get the rush and excitement.  When designing time puzzles I like to divide the time into three categories.  10% of the players will do the puzzle so fast and efficiently that they will finish with time to spare.  Another 10% will take too much time and fail, which leaves 80% of the people to brush through in the nick of time.</p>\n<h2 id="incremental-reward">Incremental reward</h2>\n<p>The player needs to know that she is achieving.  The fastest way to turn a player off is to let the game drag on with no advancement.  This is especially true for people who are playing adventure games for the first time.  In graphics adventures the reward often comes in the form of seeing new areas of the game.  New graphics and characters are often all that is needed to keep people playing.  Of course, if we are trying to tell a story, then revealing new plot elements and twists can be of equal or greater value.</p>\n<h2 id="arbitrary-puzzles">Arbitrary puzzles</h2>\n<p>Puzzles and their solutions need to make sense.  They don&rsquo;t have to be obvious, just make sense.  The best reaction after solving a tough puzzle should be, &ldquo;Of course, why didn&rsquo;t I think of that sooner!&rdquo;  The worst, and most often heard after being told the solution is, &ldquo;I never would have gotten that!&rdquo;  If the solution can only be reached by trial and error or plain luck, it&rsquo;s a bad puzzle.</p>\n<h2 id="reward-intent">Reward Intent</h2>\n<p>The object of these games is to have fun.

There is nothing wrong with this, it is almost a necessity.  The problem comes when the event that opens the new section of the world is unconnected.

While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step. It takes the grand, operatic elements of Star Wars and grounds them in a reality where power is brutal, where ecological concerns dictate the survival of entire civilizations, and where messiahs are as dangerous as they are revered.</p><p>While Star Wars draws inspiration from many sources, including Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films, and Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey, the imprint of Dune is undeniable. Lucas mixed multiple influences to craft his space opera, resulting in a faster-paced, action-driven narrative compared to Dune’s more introspective and politically complex storytelling.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened.

Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened. That bizarre, campy mess deserves to be locked in a vault and yeeted into a black hole. A clone-Ripley with alien DNA? A Xenomorph with puppy dog eyes? No thanks. Some things are best left unacknowledged.</i>).&nbsp;</p><p>And then, decades later, Ridley Scott returned. He promised to answer those burning questions we’d had since Alien.

Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment.

For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city. Here’s how to create a well-rounded cultural hub:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Add the ceramic workshop to a district close to residential zones, maximizing its impact on citizen satisfaction.</li><li>Balance satisfaction areas carefully: Focus on health and creativity early on to keep citizens productive and happy.</li><li>Use decorative statues within districts. Strategically placed statues improve attraction and encourage population growth.</li><li>Expand the radius of cultural buildings. When feasible, prioritize cultural buildings that have a broader impact radius to maximize their effectiveness.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">5. Developing Infrastructure: Production and Trade Routes</h2><p>Setting up trade routes is essential for generating income and balancing resources as your city expands. In the playthrough, the author wisely establishes trade routes to sell excess stone and sand for gold, which funds additional buildings and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>\' trade and production systems:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure to unlock and build both the Horreum, a large storehouse, as well as the Macellum, a large market which will open up Trade Routes. Without these two buildings trade will not be possible.</li><li>Identify surplus resources. Selling excess materials like stone and sand brings in steady gold income, which can be used to fund essential upgrades.</li><li>Upgrade production buildings. Increasing output from woodcutting camps and quarries helps meet the growing demand for building materials.</li><li>Create a balanced workforce. Avoid overspecializing in one resource, which could create shortages elsewhere in your economy.</li><li>Invest in a larger marketplace. Upgrading the marketplace opens up more trade routes, offering new opportunities to exchange goods and expand your economy.</li><li>Manage trade efficiently. Check each route’s profitability and ensure you’re getting maximum value from each transaction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">6. Advanced Growth: Reaching the Tier 2 City</h2><p>As your city grows, upgrading to a Tier 2 city brings new buildings and capabilities, allowing for even greater development. However, this stage also introduces new challenges, such as managing faction tensions. Here are a few ways to make the transition smoothly:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Construct safety-focused buildings. Building structures like arenas can help reduce incidents, which become more likely as factions develop tensions.</li><li>Invest in cultural influence points. Advancing through the ages improves your city’s reputation and allows for higher-level upgrades.</li><li>Manage faction relations. Keep an eye on faction satisfaction levels and address issues before they escalate into conflicts. Certain factions may have different needs or preferences.</li><li>Create additional districts. As new buildings become available, expand your residential and industrial districts to accommodate a growing population.</li><li>Save resources for key upgrades. Some Tier 2 buildings are expensive, so stockpile resources like wood, stone, and gold to avoid delays in construction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">7. Unlocking Wonders and Advanced Cultural Buildings</h2><p>Once you’ve secured your city’s basics, investing in wonders and advanced cultural buildings provides significant boosts. In the video, the author demonstrates how to build high-value structures like the arena and the Agoge Center to enhance influence. Here’s a guide to prioritize wonders effectively:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Focus on the Agoge Center&nbsp;or library to boost cultural influence. These buildings improve city-wide satisfaction and increase your cultural reach.</li><li>Place wonders in high-traffic areas to maximize their impact. Wonders near residential zones offer bonuses to more citizens.</li><li>Consider safety upgrades for wonder districts. Building defensive structures near wonders ensures they’re protected from incidents.</li><li>Save resources for construction. Wonders often require substantial materials, so plan to accumulate what you need before starting.</li><li>Regularly expand surveyor cabins. This allows you to build wonders farther out from the core, increasing your city’s total area.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8. Optimizing Faction Management and Decrees</h2><p>At this stage, you’ll encounter factions with unique demands. Managing these factions carefully, especially if they develop tensions, will become an important of your city management. Use decrees and policies to mitigate conflicts and enhance your city’s stability.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Issue decrees strategically. Certain decrees, such as increased food production, improve citizen satisfaction or reduce faction tensions.</li><li>Manage faction trust levels. High trust prevents conflicts, while low trust increases the likelihood of incidents and disputes.</li><li>Consider faction removal if tensions rise too high. Sometimes, expelling a problematic faction is more beneficial than dealing with constant conflicts.</li><li>Create buffers between rival factions. Placing neutral buildings or parks between contentious factions can reduce interactions and potential conflicts.</li><li>Balance decrees for all factions. Ensure that no single faction feels neglected, as this can quickly lead to dissatisfaction.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2><p>Building a successful city in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;requires a careful blend of resource management, cultural development, and strategic planning.

Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment.

Between work (or trying to find my next role), family, and the general madness of daily life (soccer practices and games, lifts to here and there, the dog, etc.), finding the time to sit down and really immerse yourself in a game can feel like a luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s where city-building games come in, and let me tell you, they\'ve been a game-changer (pun totally intended).</p><span></span><h3 style="text-align: left;">The Magic of the Pause Button</h3><p>First off, let’s talk about one of the biggest perks of city-building games: the ability to pause or stop the game whenever you need to. Whether you\'re deep into a session of Cities: Skylines meticulously planning the perfect road network or trying to ensure your colonists survive another day in Surviving Mars, you can hit pause and step away without missing a beat. No need to worry about respawning in an FPS firefight or letting your team down in the middle of a MOBA match (I could write a whole posts on all the insults I\'ve taken from World of Tanks players).&nbsp;</p><p>These game wait for you, not the other way around.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Meditative Moments in Gaming</h3><p>Additionally, city-building games offer something incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world: a sense of peace and mindfulness. There’s a certain meditative quality to watching your city grow, whether it\'s a bustling metropolis in Cities: Skylines or a fragile colony on the brink of collapse in Frostpunk. You’re not just reacting to what’s happening on screen; you’re crafting something from the ground up, watching your creation evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s like a digital Zen garden, where each decision is a small stone you’re placing just so, bringing order to the chaos. Oh the hundreds of hours I\'ve spent in my Cities Skylines cities, beautifying them with parks, trees and endless landscaping.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Building Something That Lasts (well, sorta)</h3><p>Speaking of crafting, there’s something deeply satisfying about the “building something” aspect of these games. Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge.

Someone with extensive experience piloting TDs would likely tell you that the following are the best setups, crew skills, and playstyle strategies to help your team secure victory.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Vehicle Setup in Detail</h3><h4 style="text-align: left;">Equipment Choices</h4><p>For both the Hellcat and Super Hellcat, the goal is to maximize their strengths: mobility, concealment, and firepower.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Optics (Binocular Telescope or Coated Optics)</b>: Increasing your view range is critical. Spotting enemies before they spot you allows you to make informed decisions on when to shoot and when to relocate. The choice between Binocular Telescope and Coated Optics depends on your playstyle; Binoculars for more stationary play and Coated Optics for more active scouting and repositioning.</li><li><b>Gun Rammer</b>: Reducing your reload time significantly increases your Damage Per Minute (DPM), making you a bigger threat on the battlefield. Being able to shoot more frequently means you can exploit enemy tanks\' vulnerabilities more often.</li><li><b>Camo Net / Turbocharger</b>: The choice here is between enhancing your stealth with a Camo Net or boosting your mobility with a Turbocharger. The Hellcat, being slightly more geared towards ambush tactics, benefits greatly from a Camo Net. The Super Hellcat, with its enhanced mobility, can further capitalize on this with a Turbocharger, allowing for rapid repositioning and flanking maneuvers.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;">Crew Skills in Detail</h3><p>Developing your crew skills is crucial for maximizing the potential of your TDs.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Commander</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Sixth Sense</b> is non-negotiable for TDs. Knowing when you\'ve been spotted can save you from being quickly eliminated.</li><li><b>Recon</b> further boosts your view range, complementing your equipment choices.</li></ul><li><b>Gunner</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> makes you harder to detect, a key survival trait for a TD.</li><li><b>Snap Shot</b> improves your gun\'s accuracy during turret movements, allowing for more reliable shots after repositioning.</li></ul><li><b>Driver</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Smooth Ride</b> reduces the accuracy penalty when firing on the move, which can be beneficial in hit-and-run tactics.</li><li><b>Off-Road Driving</b> improves your mobility on various terrains, enhancing your ability to quickly get into position or escape danger.</li></ul><li><b>Loader</b>: If your TD has a dedicated loader,</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> further enhances your stealth.</li><li><b>Safe Stowage</b> increases the durability of your ammo rack, reducing the chance of being taken out by a single hit.</li></ul></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Super Hellcat | World of Tanks Best Replays</h2><div style="text-align: center;"></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Gameplay Tactics in Detail</h2><h4 style="text-align: left;">Early Game</h4><p>The initial phase of the match is about gathering intelligence and taking key positions without being overly aggressive.</p><p><b>Scout and Reposition</b>: Use your mobility to reach forward positions quickly. Your goal is to gather as much information as possible on enemy movements for your team. After spotting, fall back to a safe distance before engaging.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Mid to Late Game</h4><p>As the match progresses, your role shifts towards exploiting enemy weaknesses and supporting your team from the second line.</p><p><b>Hit and Run</b>: Identify isolated targets or support teammates by targeting enemies focused on your allies. After firing, immediately relocate to avoid counter-fire, especially from enemy artillery or hidden TDs.</p><p><b>Supporting Heavies</b>: Position yourself behind or beside your team’s heavy tanks. From here, you can safely engage enemies that are distracted by your frontline, using your superior DPM to whittle them down.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Map Movement and Positioning</h3><p>Understanding each map\'s key features and sight lines is crucial. Use terrain to your advantage, keeping in mind that your primary goal is to support your team by dealing damage from concealed positions or by exploiting enemy flanks.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Use Terrain: Always be mindful of hills, ridges, and other terrain features that can provide cover or concealment. Being able to shoot without exposing your tank is a key skill for TD players.</li><li>Avoid Open Fields: Open areas are death zones for lightly armored vehicles like the Hellcat and Super Hellcat. Move from cover to cover and stay aware of potential threats like enemy TDs and artillery.</li><li>High Ground Advantage: High ground not only provides a better view of the battlefield but also makes it harder for enemies to hit your tank. Use elevation to your advantage whenever possible.</li></ul><p></p><p>By focusing on these strategies and continuously practicing and refining your skills, you\'ll greatly contribute to your team\'s efforts and enjoy success in your Hellcat and Super Hellcat in World of Tanks.</p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How a Super Hellcat should tag along with...</h2><div><span><div>The Hellcat, with its blend of mobility, firepower, and limited armor, can significantly benefit from coordinating with certain types of vehicles on the battlefield. Here’s a breakdown of which vehicles a Hellcat should consider partnering with and why:</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Medium Tanks</h3><div>Medium tanks are versatile and can perform a wide range of roles, making them excellent partners for the Hellcat. Their balance of speed, armor, and firepower allows them to effectively scout, flank, and engage enemies at various ranges. A Hellcat can support medium tanks by providing additional firepower from a second line or by exploiting openings created by the mediums’ aggressive maneuvers. This pairing can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions, moving to support weakened flanks or to capitalize on enemy vulnerabilities.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heavy Tanks</h3><div>While heavy tanks lack the Hellcat’s mobility, they make up for it with superior armor and firepower. Teaming up with heavy tanks allows the Hellcat to operate from behind the frontline, using the heavies as a shield while it delivers precise shots. This partnership is especially effective in areas with good cover and long sightlines, where the Hellcat can use its excellent gun to support the heavy tanks without exposing itself to enemy fire. The Hellcat should avoid blocking the retreat paths of allied heavy tanks and remain ready to reposition if the enemy breaks through the frontline.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Other TDs</h3><div>Pairing with other TDs, especially those with strong frontal armor, can create a formidable defensive line that can deter enemy advances. The Hellcat, with its good mobility, can act as a scout or flanker for this group, identifying targets for the more heavily armored TDs to engage. However, this requires good communication and coordination to ensure that the Hellcat does not become isolated or targeted by enemy artillery.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Artillery</h3><div>While not directly tagging along with artillery, a Hellcat can play a crucial role in protecting these valuable assets from enemy scouts and light tanks. By staying relatively close to friendly artillery, the Hellcat can use its mobility and firepower to intercept and eliminate threats to the team’s artillery pieces, ensuring they can continue to support the team effectively.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Light Tanks</h3><div>A somewhat less common but potentially effective partnership can be formed with light tanks. Light tanks excel in scouting and can quickly identify key enemy positions. A Hellcat following a light tank at a safe distance can capitalize on the scouting information, using its accurate gun to take out spotted enemies before they can react. However, this requires the Hellcat to stay alert and ready to move, as the light tank’s fast-paced scouting can lead them into rapidly changing situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>When pairing with any vehicle, the key for the Hellcat driver is to maintain situational awareness and adapt to the battle’s flow. The Hellcat\'s strength lies in its ability to deliver impactful damage from positions where it is not easily targeted. Effective communication with teammates and choosing the right moments to strike or relocate are crucial for leveraging the Hellcat’s capabilities to their fullest.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">How NOT to play the Super Hellcat!</h2></span></div><p style="text-align: left;">One of the worst ways to play the Hellcat in World of Tanks is to treat it like a frontline brawler or a heavy tank. The Hellcat is equipped with a powerful gun and excellent mobility but suffers from very thin armor and a relatively open turret design, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fire from almost all types of weapons it encounters on the battlefield.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Mistakes in Playing the Hellcat as a Frontline Tank:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Engaging in Direct Firefights: Attempting to trade shots with enemy tanks, especially heavies or well-armored mediums and TDs, is a quick way to get destroyed. The Hellcat\'s armor is insufficient to absorb hits, and its relatively large profile for a TD makes it an easy target when exposed.</li><li>Ignoring Cover and Concealment: Failing to use the terrain, bushes, and other forms of cover to hide your tank and mask your movements negates one of the Hellcat\'s main strengths – its ability to strike unseen. Being visible on the front lines means you\'ll likely be one of the first targets to be fired upon.</li><li>Static Gameplay: Staying in one position for too long, especially on the front lines, can make you an easy target for enemy artillery and tanks. The Hellcat thrives on its ability to relocate quickly, providing support where it\'s needed and avoiding return fire.</li><li>Not Using its Mobility: The Hellcat\'s speed is a key feature that allows it to flex across the map, responding to threats, reinforcing failing flanks, or exploiting gaps in the enemy lines. Playing it in a stationary, frontline role wastes this potential, making the tank much less effective than it could be.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Avoid These Mistakes:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Play to Your Strengths: Use the Hellcat\'s mobility and excellent gun handling to engage enemies from unexpected angles, relocate frequently to avoid being targeted, and always look for opportunities to support your team from a distance or the second line.</li><li>Stay Aware: Keep an eye on the mini-map and be ready to move if you\'re in danger of being flanked, or if there\'s a more advantageous position you can take to support your team.</li><li>Engage Wisely: Choose your battles carefully. Look for targets that are engaged with your teammates, isolated, or presenting their weaker armor to you. Avoid head-on engagements with tanks that can easily outgun or outarmor you.</li></ul><p></p><p>By avoiding the frontline brawler playstyle and focusing on mobility, stealth, and strategic engagement, you\'ll greatly increase your effectiveness and survivability in the Hellcat, turning it into a formidable asset for your team.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final thoughts...</h2><p>Mastering the Hellcat and Super Hellcat requires patience, good positioning, and an understanding of when to engage or retreat. Remember, your primary role is to support your team by providing accurate and timely damage from a distance or flanking. Avoid direct confrontations with heavier tanks unless you have a clear advantage or support. By following these strategies and adjusting your playstyle based on the battle\'s flow, you\'ll become a valuable asset to your team and help secure victory on the battlefield.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p>Jumping back into World of Tanks after long hiatus, and a big update felt a bit like a cold splash of water yesterday - especially when I dove straight into battle with my Super Hellcat and ended up more like a skittish kitten hiding in the bushes (literally) than the fierce TD I should\'ve been.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, my gameplay was rusty, and the match didn’t go well at all.

The game appears (and plays) like an aquatic combination of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/18/coffee-talk-review/">Coffee Talk</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/15/steamworld-dig-2-review/">SteamWorld Dig</a></em>, which are both games I very much enjoy. I downloaded <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> upon release on Switch, but it fell into my backlog until this year; in recent months, I&#8217;ve gotten around to properly playing through the game, and I&#8217;m glad I did so &#8211; not only does it deliver on the rewarding gameplay loop and sumptuous pixel art graphics I hoped for, but it&#8217;s been an ideal showcase for chilled handheld gaming on the Nintendo Switch 2!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting the review, I&#8217;d like to mention the brief controversy around <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, as I remember it adding unfair caution to my approach to the game. Back in 2023, the game was nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards, which drew criticism because the game wasn&#8217;t an Indie game &#8211; the developer MINTROCKET was a subsidiary of Nexon, a lucrative South Korean company. The developers were not responsible for the game being nominated, and it appears that the nomination was based off of the pixel art graphics and relaxed alternative vibe of the game, instead of the literal definition of an independent company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, the CEO of MINTROCKET &#8211; and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> creator &#8211; Jaeho Hwang said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>“I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like a more detailed explanation and opinion, I highly recommend <a href="https://indiecator.org/2023/11/15/why-is-dave-the-diver-not-indie/">this post on <em>Indiecator</em> by MagiWasTaken</a>, which discusses the situation in better detail than I could in this short review introduction. Ironically, it&#8217;s since been announced in 2024 that MINTROCKET is becoming independent (albeit with support from Nexon to carry out the move). My main point is that this controversy is not something to think ill of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> or MINTROCKET for, and that allowed me to dive into the game fresh. Right, that&#8217;s enough preamble, so let&#8217;s get into the review!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Catch of the Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> follows the story of Dave and his friends, who&#8217;ve travelled to the oceanic Blue Hole to set up a sushi restaurant called Bancho Sushi (named after the head chef Bancho). As the title suggests, Dave must dive underwater to collect the fish and ingredients, and this forms the majority of the game &#8211; you must balance risk and reward as you collect as much as Dave can carry, whilst keeping track of your oxygen levels and means to get back to the surface &#8211; either by swimming back up, or finding an Escape Pod point. If you run out of oxygen and get stranded underwater, you lose all but one of your collected items, which severely impacts the success of the sushi restaurant in the evenings. This risk/reward system is reminiscent of the digging in <em>SteamWorld Dig</em>, and is implemented superbly here &#8211; the player has to make the tough decision between keeping what they&#8217;ve got, or risking pushing a little further and potentially losing it all. It&#8217;s a brilliant gameplay loop that keeps you coming back for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15160" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15140" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15139" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The game eases you in gently, starting with introducing the mechanics of catching fish at a relatively shallow depth. Your main weapon is the harpoon, which can be fired in front of you to reel in fish. However, there&#8217;s a delay whilst the fish struggles, which gives other dangerous creatures the time to close in on Dave &#8211; and later on, the harpoon requires multiple hits and/or extra button combinations to capture stronger fish. There are also various items to discover and collect, either as supplementary ingredients found in submerged cooking pots, or as materials scattered on the sea floor. Dave only has a certain amount they can hold at once, which quickly becomes reason to earn the Gold needed for upgrading your Cargo Box storage limit &#8211; as well as your Air Tank, Harpoon Gun, and more. In turn, this motivates the player for the sushi segments of the game; depending on how well the restaurant performs in the evenings, the more Gold you&#8217;ll earn for upgrades. Both sides of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> continue to ingeniously compliment each other in this way, as success in one helps you in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the sushi segments are rather different from the diving, and this is where my earlier comparison to <em>Coffee Talk</em> comes in. After setting sail to Bancho Sushi, you start by going through a list of your possible dishes to serve in your evening menu; your selection is based upon the fish you&#8217;ve caught and the ingredients you&#8217;ve acquired. The quality and quantity of your haul determines your success, as rarer fish open up more expensive dishes that result in a more lucrative evening. Upon selecting each dish, you can also enhance it if you have enough excess ingredients &#8211; a process given extra visual flair by the wonderful animated cutscenes of Bancho preparing the food. These animations aren&#8217;t limited to just Bancho, and are sprinkled throughout <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, such as when weapons expert Duff upgrades your guns. Each of these sequences has a tongue-in-cheek over-exaggerated tone, and add to the playful charm of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15133" height="360" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif?w=640" width="640" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in Bancho Sushi you can browse and sell your ingredients for quickfire Gold, as well as decorate the restaurant as you see fit, and even hire extra members of staff to help you out. The latter are essential, as over time the restaurant gets busier; once you open the restaurant, you control Dave as he serves dishes and maintains the restaurant, and hiring extra hands to help is key to success. Whether it&#8217;s pouring drinks, dashing around to serve sushi plates, cleaning up, or keeping Bancho well-stocked with sushi, this is a frenetic <em>Overcooked</em>-style part of the game that contrasts well with the diving. It&#8217;s certainly not as layered as the underwater gameplay, but it&#8217;s not supposed to be, and does a successful job at giving the player a break between each dive. Plus, it&#8217;s extremely satisfying to see the profits come in &#8211; which can then be spent on upgrades the next day, when the cycle begins anew&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Just Keep Swimming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this core gameplay loop, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> steadily introduces new characters and locations throughout the seven main story chapters. They&#8217;re an eclectic bunch, each with their own expertise and side quests. Archaeologist Dr. Bacon propels the main story forward; as you dive deeper, you discover much more than just fish, including secret civilizations and bigger ecological threats to the Blue Hole &#8211; the latter of which is tracked by the biologist Ellie, who gives you various collection tasks through the Ecowatcher app. Speaking of which, your progress is mostly tracked via these apps, which are accessed via the efficient menu on Dave&#8217;s smartphone. To give a few examples: you might use the phone to acquire and upgrade weapons (with the help of the aforementioned Duff); you might browse your snaps for photographer Udo; or you might look through your Pokémon-style Marinca collection for Sato, an Ash Ketchum lookalike!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15146" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15153" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15154" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between all these characters and side quests, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> has something for everyone. If you like collecting then you can focus on filling out the Marinca (essentially a Pokédex for fish), if you like the sushi-management side you can focus on optimising your earnings, and if you like exploring then you can focus on the diving. Whichever way you play, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> smartly manages to naturally push the story on regardless &#8211; for example, a character named Otto opens a farm partway into the game, where you can grow crops such as rice. Growing these ingredients helps you to reliably create more valuable dishes in the evening; but to help out Otto and subsequently build up the farm, you need to collect certain items, which requires becoming proficient at the diving. Each element of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> gently motivates the others in this way, and therefore pushes the player to test out every facet of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a side effect of this admirable gameplay variety is that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> occasionally inserts under-baked minigames or quick time events. One instance of this is the cooking competition side missions, where you must gather ingredients for Bancho as you normally would, but upon doing so, you must then engage in first-person cooking challenges. These consist of basic button presses and directional inputs, and feel like a rushed version of either a <em>Cooking Mama</em> or <em>Mario Party</em> minigame. It was the rare moment in <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> where I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15123" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15124" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15127" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15136" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, some of these asides work better than others &#8211; a relatively quick soldering minigame is an enjoyable and brief inclusion, and there&#8217;s a compelling <em>Balatro</em>-style card game, but on the other hand, a one-time stealth sequence is particularly badly designed. These hiccups are rare enough that they don&#8217;t significantly detract from <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, but they were also noticeable enough that I had to mention them in this review. They just feel unnecessary &#8211; it&#8217;s as if <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> felt it had to extend itself beyond the main gameplay loop that it executes so superbly. If anything, the high quality of the core diving-and-sushi-selling gameplay only make the brief diversions more jarring.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Deadly Depths</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the various other side missions and gameplay mechanics, it&#8217;s the diving that&#8217;s understandably the focus of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, and it&#8217;s exceptionally well-balanced. As aforementioned, your initial harpoon is a unique weapon to master &#8211; but Dave can also carry one firearm, either by collecting them underwater or by crafting them beforehand. There&#8217;s a range of weapon types: you might use the Net Gun for catching large swathes of fish, or perhaps the Grenade Launcher for explosive damage, or even (my weapon of choice) the Sniper Rifle for long-range damage. The latter is especially handy when tackling sea life that is aggressive at close range, such as the many sharks patrolling the Blue Hole!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15161" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Dave isn&#8217;t just reeling in small fish. You&#8217;ll soon be fighting not only sharks, but hostile jellyfish, giant squids, and plenty more! Significant story events are often accompanied by a boss fight against a dangerous opponent such as these, introduced with stylish freeze frames reminiscent of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and signifying the stakes of the encounter. Additionally, new areas of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> can be a trial by fire, with enemies that suddenly reduce huge amounts of your oxygen supply (which doubles as a health bar of sorts) with a single hit. However, the challenge rarely felt unfair, and any failed dives were always down to my own mistakes &#8211; and only left me more motivated to improve my aquatic skills or upgrade my gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, as well as your harpoon and firearm, Dave can carry a melee weapon (also used for mining materials) and two pieces of equipment. The latter of these can vary, from battle items such as a proximity mine, to ways of helping Dave in a pinch, such as portable oxygen refills. Most of these can be found underwater, or alternatively, they can be pre-purchased from Cobra in the boat before starting your dive, adding another way for the player to customise their approach. Overall, there&#8217;s a well-judged balance between giving the player plenty of options, but not giving you so much power that you can become complacent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15142" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15172" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15168" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when you feel comfortable with Dave and his toolset, the missions being asked of you often cleverly push you out of your comfort zone &#8211; and if you&#8217;re not careful, it doesn&#8217;t take much for a dangerous enemy or perilous area to derail your dive and leave you back at the boat almost empty-handed. It&#8217;s oh-so-easy to fall into the trap of completing just one more mission, collecting just one more item, capturing just one more fish &#8211; but equally, there&#8217;s an undeniable thrill to escaping just in time. In the later chapters, missions become more specific to match your increased skills, and particular ingredients can necessitate repeated captures of rare creatures. This cycle reminded me of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and similarly to that series, provides a tangible reason to keep capturing the most elusive fish &#8211; in this case, to find the rarest ingredients and compose the finest dishes at Bancho Sushi!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Under the Sea</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the endearing yet adventurous nature of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the graphical style; the gorgeous pixel-art invites you in, making diving a little deeper &#8211; and playing a little longer &#8211; even more enticing. The shallow regions are full of bright welcoming colours, but the variety only builds from here. Every layer under the water has a unique visual identity, such as the dark Blue Hole Depths, or the extreme cold and heat of later areas. Meanwhile, night-time dives feature a shining kaleidoscope of colourful foliage that feels magical to navigate &#8211; when you&#8217;re not being pursued by deadly fish, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15162" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the human character designs have a palpable sense of personality. This gets more spotlight in the earlier-mentioned animated cutscenes, which blend the stunning pixel art with the tongue-in-cheek humour that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> does so well. By the end of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, the roster of characters have a real sense of camaraderie between them, which contributes to that overall warm and relaxed feeling that the game has. Add in the detailed multitude of marine species and food recipes, and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> really is a delectably beautiful game. Playing it on the large handheld screen <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/09/09/did-my-hopes-for-the-switch-2-become-a-reality/">of the Switch 2</a> has only accentuated this feeling further for me &#8211; and it&#8217;s been a great example for how that console helps the back catalogue of the original Switch to shine even brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial compliment to the visuals of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the music, which is often a wonderfully soothing backdrop to your deep sea exploration. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a notably therapeutic game when you’re just casually collecting fish, exploring the vast swathes of water, and listening to the delicate musical backdrop. My favourite piece of music is for a late-game frozen area, where these tranquil tones morph into a synth-style inspirational beat. Also, music fans will get an extra treat from a certain cameo appearance at Bancho Sushi, who comes complete with a musical performance that I’ve been listening to many times since! Not to be glossed over is the sound design, too &#8211; the sounds of marine life, the tense pull of a harpoon, the whooshing of waves, it all sounds authentic and distinct, and pulls you further into the watery world of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15163" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15148" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg?w=863" width="863" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15150" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing about this game &#8211; it reels you in, not necessarily in a sudden way, but a gradual one. As the in-game days go by, you settle more thoroughly into the gameplay loop, getting more familiar with characters old and new, until they become familiar friends on your adventure. There&#8217;s a sense of pleasing routine to checking your farms for crops and ingredients, then going diving and completing missions, before then preparing for the evening Bancho Sushi business. It&#8217;s a lot like the charm of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> or <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but with the added element of gripping underwater gameplay to go alongside it. The game is kept fresh by the steady incline of options and equipment available to Dave, and this creates an endgame with potentially endless longevity. Even when you finish all of the main story missions, you still have a restaurant business to run, and you can continue building it out to your hearts content. There&#8217;s extra DLC too, two of which (the <em>Dredge</em> and <em>Godzilla</em> tie-in packs) are free, for those looking for extra content!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a delight to play through <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. The mix of gripping gameplay and relaxing sushi simulation &#8211; combined with the incredible art direction and music &#8211; makes for an RPG full of endearing charm and well-meaning adventure. At its heart is whimsy and a sense of positivity, and that soaks through into every part of the game &#8211; and each part compliments the other in a wonderfully natural way. My only criticism is that this enthusiasm leads to the introduction of impromptu minigames and quick time events that sometimes feel underdeveloped in contrast to the main diving gameplay &#8211; but they&#8217;re few and far between, and a drop in the ocean compared to the sea of brilliance within <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. There&#8217;s brilliant longevity built in too &#8211; even after finishing the main story, the diving and sushi restaurant aspects remain, for those who&#8217;d like to continue building Bancho Sushi into the best restaurant it can be. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a treasure of a game, and it comes highly recommended from me!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center

This particular Direct was split into three distinct segments: first about the 40th Anniversary of Mario, then news for the original Nintendo Switch, and then finally information on the Switch 2 &#8211; and altogether it made for a barnstorming hour-long performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo has been on a run of brilliant Directs over the last few years, but this might genuinely be my favourite one for a long while. Many of the announcements in this Direct speak specifically to me and the games I have been looking forward to, and it&#8217;s genuinely made whittling my choices down to five a tough task! If you&#8217;d like to see the full Nintendo Direct, you can do so below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Honourable Mentions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of it being a tough task&#8230; With so much packed into the Direct, I am first going to run through some other announcements that I was glad or intrigued to see, but didn&#8217;t make the cut for the five announcements that appealed most to me personally. The Nintendo Direct started with several <em>Mario </em>announcements in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary: this included a trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> in 2026, as well as a collection of both <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> games for Nintendo Switch, coming October 2nd this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retrospectively, this does make <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/04/lets-chat-3d-mario-games-are-coming-to-switch-but-where-is-galaxy-2/">the decision not to include <em>Galaxy 2</em> in the <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> collection</a> feel very calculated. I personally will likely pass on this new release of the <em>Galaxy </em>games, as the £58.99 cost (or £33.99 separately) feels excessive &#8211; and whilst they are superb games, I doubt I&#8217;ll play them enough when there are so many other new games to play. I do, however, hope to get the physical <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOor7cl-qF_B_yaH1ketH1_ep2UqAIeMsULytGxbXaJ-8c79YpmKe">Rosalina&#8217;s Storybook</a> they are making, as that would be lovely to keep in the collection!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15028" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15029" height="377" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg?w=670" width="670" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15027" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15026" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we got a release date of 4th December for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was great to have confirmed &#8211; and the only reason it isn&#8217;t in my main five picks below is that the new footage left me a bit hesitant. We got to see the new bike Samus will use to traverse the world, and there was something off about it &#8211; the world looked a bit too empty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The footage reminded me of the infamous Mako in the first <em>Mass Effect</em> game, which was also known for wide open spaces that felt empty and were awkward to navigate. Visually, the bike is very cool, and the first-person segments look fantastic, but I was surprised at the briefness of this new footage. I sincerely hope that isn&#8217;t a sign of a lack of confidence in the game; either way, eight years after the initial announcement, I remain very excited for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> to finally launch!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I&#8217;d like to give a mention to the <em>Pokémon</em> segment of the Direct. We got the announcement of a brand new spin-off game named <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, which looks like a mix between<em> Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>, where you play as a Ditto-turned-human (whether this is charming or horrific, you decide)! This game probably won&#8217;t be for me, but I envisage it being very popular, by blending life-sim mechanics with the popularity of the world of <em>Pokémon</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, we got more info for the soon-to-be-released <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, showing off new Mega Evolutions; this segment ended with an announcement of the upcoming <em>Mega Dimension</em> paid DLC, and this felt quite cynical &#8211; it feels strange to have paid DLC announced before we even have the base game. I&#8217;ll wait and see how that DLC materialises, but for now, I&#8217;m fine not seeing much more about <em>Z-A</em>, as I&#8217;m definitely purchasing the game at launch. From here, the Direct transitioned into the surprise announcement of <em>Danganronpa 2&#215;2</em>, a new version of <em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> with added content! I only relatively recently finished (<a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/09/danganronpa-2-goodbye-despair-review-an-ambitious-beautiful-mess-of-a-sequel/">and reviewed</a>) the original game on Switch, and I really enjoyed it overall, so I&#8217;ll be curious to see how much difference the additions make.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15020" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15024" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15025" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15022" height="338" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg?w=600" width="600" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That was quite a long honourable mentions section, wasn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a result of just how many exciting announcements we received; I finished this Direct feeling very optimistic about the future of the Switch 2, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten into my top five reason why! When there are so many announcements, writing this sort of article helps me process the Direct and focus in on the games I&#8217;m going to prioritise playing, and I hope it is an enjoyable read for you too! Right, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#5: Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the most exciting part of the <em>Mario </em>section of the Direct was the announcement of a brand new Yoshi game, named <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em>! Yoshi side-scrollers have a reputation for charming art directions &#8211; for example <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Woolly World</em> and <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Crafted World</em> &#8211; and this game continues that, with a gorgeous stop-motion visual style bursting with colour and personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot of the game follows Yoshi after the appearance of a peculiar book named Mr. E, with pages detailing mysterious creatures. Yoshi jumps into the book (which is the reason for the storybook graphical style) and meets various new creatures, with the details jotted down into the book as Yoshi does so. Completing the storybook of fantastical creatures is an accompaniment to the charming platforming, and there&#8217;s a palpable sense of warmth and whimsy to it all. This game looks ideal for playing on a rainy weekend, wrapped up warm and enjoying the cosy gameplay. I see <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>being a brilliant experience for all ages of players, and I look forward to playing it myself when it releases in Spring 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#4: Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Direct contained the announcements of release dates for several high-profile previously-announced games, and three of these appear on my list. Starting this off is <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>, the third <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> game after the original and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/05/15/my-to-play-list-may-2023-progress/">Age of Calamity</a></em>, which is confirmed to release on November 6th. Just as the latter of those filled in story gaps for <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, one of the main appeals of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is adding story details for <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. Specifically, the time period that Princess Zelda is sent back to in that game &#8211; and I&#8217;m glad to see this time covered more thoroughly, as it felt to me that Zelda was unfairly side-lined in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as a release date, the new footage showed off playable characters such as Queen Sonia, King Rauru, and a new unnamed Korok character. The gameplay looks like the expected <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-esque combat, but there are some additions, such as Zonai devices and multi-character Sync Strikes that change depending on the character combinations. There&#8217;s also the confirmation of local GameShare multiplayer and splitscreen, and glimpses of many epic visual sequences such as airborne Gleeok battles. I accept that the gameplay will likely be repetitive, but for me the appeal of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games is the visual spectacle and extra lore &#8211; and<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> looks to be delivering on that!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#3: Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the brand new announcements of the Direct was that of a new mainline <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, named <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em>. It&#8217;s been wonderful to see <em>Fire Emblem</em> gradually become a household name in the West, with the 3DS games such as <em>Awakening</em> laying the groundwork for <em>Three Houses</em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/14/a-little-zelda-a-lotta-farming-takeaways-from-the-nintendo-direct/">Engage</a> </em>to be massive hits on Switch. The distinction setting <em>Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart is the gladiator-style Heroic Games, which has a multitude of characters competing for the fulfilled wishes that supposedly reward your victory. At the end of the trailer, we see a tease of Sothis, a character from Three Houses &#8211; so it appears there may be a story connection to that game as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the game looks stunning, with gorgeous anime visuals, and clean turn-based strategy UI design. Part of the appeal of <em>Fire Emblem</em> is the stakes of building character relationships in a world where permadeath is possible, and the gladiatorial setting will hopefully provide a fresh twist to that structure that will set<em> Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart. The trailer has a variety of striking characters, and I&#8217;m looking forward to finding my favourites! For now, we only have a general 2026 release date, so I&#8217;d guess that this game will be one of the major late-year releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#2: Resident Evil: Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think it surprising that I&#8217;ve put two already-announced games above the news of a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game; but that&#8217;s a reflection of my adoration for the franchises these next two games are a part of, and how stoked I am to see additional news about their next instalments. Firstly we have <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, the much-anticipated ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> game (if you don&#8217;t count <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/27/resident-evil-zero-review/"><em>Resident Evil Zero</em></a>). This latest entry stars FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she pursues the truth about a deadly virus and the mystery of her mother&#8217;s death &#8211; a path which leads her to the ruins of Raccoon City. This game had already been announced for other consoles, but this is the formal announcement of a Switch 2 version, which is brilliant to see. On Switch, <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/11/25/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/16/resident-evil-village-review/">Resident Evil Village</a></em> could only be played as Cloud games, but the more conventional release of <em>Requiem </em>shows that the console can (for now, at least) keep up with modern large-scale third-party releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually might play <em>Requiem </em>on Switch 2 &#8211; my only other means would be PC or Xbox Series S, and as someone who likes to collect physical copies of <em>Resident Evil</em> games on console, that makes the Switch 2 version more appealing to me. <em>Requiem </em>is up there as one of my most anticipated games; I adore the <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise, and am eagerly awaiting <em>Requiem</em> to see how they interweave the lore of the series into the story. Other than Chris Redfield, we haven&#8217;t had any of the earlier characters show up in the main series since <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, and with the return to Raccoon City, this feels like an ideal time for some guest appearances of older, more experienced versions of those fan favourites. Grace Ashcroft is also the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character from the lesser-known spin-off <em>Resident Evil Outbreak</em> games, which already shows that Capcom is happy playing with some deep-cut lore. I happen to have bought the two <em>Outbreak</em> games second-hand before <em>Requiem</em> was even announced, and am planning to play them before the launch of <em>Requiem </em>and write up my thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Requiem </em>trailer in the Direct was full of intense visuals, threatening figures, and story hints (such as the iconic Umbrella Corporation logo). It struck me that there&#8217;s an underlying grungy tone waiting to break out, which I&#8217;m very excited to discover. This can even be seen in the logo for <em>Requiem</em>, and the burned-out profile shot of Grace near the end of this new trailer. Right now, the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise is in a very healthy place (as healthy a a series about viral monstrosities can be, anyway), and it&#8217;s given Capcom a resulting confidence that could make this game utterly exceptional. They&#8217;re playing their cards close to their chest, concealing the full extent of the horrors that await us on February 27th&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#1: Hades II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yes, oh yes. This is an announcement fans of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/14/hades-review/">Hades</a></em> and Supergiant Games have been awaiting since the reveal of <em>Hades II</em> back at The Game Awards in 2022, and now it&#8217;s here &#8211; the release date of the official 1.0 version, releasing digitally on Switch and PC on September 25th (and physically on November 20th). The first <em>Hades</em> is a phenomenal roguelike action game that turned many players into fans of the genre, but it was quite a surprise when Supergiant announced a sequel &#8211; not only was the first game utterly jam-packed with content and ideas, but they&#8217;d never done a sequel game before. I&#8217;ve purposefully been avoiding details about the game in Early Access, as I&#8217;d like to go in fresh and see what marvels Supergiant have cooked up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon this could be a <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>/<em>Galaxy 2</em> situation, where the developers have so many ideas and so much creativity to share, that they need a whole other game to fit it all in. This time, we play as the immortal Princess of the Underworld, battling against the Titan of Time and exploring an even larger and deeper mythic world of Olympian Gods. In the Direct, this was visualized with a cutscene that gave me goosebumps from the visual flair on show; Supergiant are known for their sumptuous visuals and music, and that&#8217;s very much still the case here. I&#8217;m eager to dive back into the rich gameplay and gripping story of the world of <em>Hades</em>, reuniting with previous characters (Artemis is back!) and meeting new ones. I honestly didn&#8217;t expect the release date to be so soon, but in less than two weeks we&#8217;ll be able to play the 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> &#8211; discovering new Boons, enemies, locations, and more. Bring it on!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>This Nintendo Direct was sensational, and answered many questions about release dates and upcoming games for the Switch 2 (and Switch) release slate. I&#8217;ve been enjoying my gaming a lot recently, and this Direct has only fuelled that passion more &#8211; the only problem is going to be finding the time to play all these games!

It&#8217;s been roughly a year and a half since I wrote that post, and the Switch 2 has been out for just over three months &#8211; so we now have comprehensive knowledge of what the system offers. With the Switch 2, Nintendo took the wise (and safe) approach, capitalising on the continued popularity of the Switch brand and not changing things too drastically. The console is more of an iteration rather than a revolution, but it certainly makes significant changes and upgrades in certain areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had some time with the Switch 2, I thought it&#8217;d be a suitable moment to take a look back at my aforementioned post about my hopes for the console, run one-by-one through the list, and talk about which became a reality (and which didn&#8217;t). Then, at the end of the post, I&#8217;ll summarise my current personal opinions on the Switch 2, taking these results into account. Right then, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Optimize the eShop: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My foremost request was to improve the eShop, which was struggling on multiple fronts on the original Switch: the sheer volume of releases made discoverability of games difficult; there was a lack of quality control; and the user interface was susceptible to noticeable lag. In my opinion, this was one of the most important areas for Nintendo to improve upon &#8211; it might seem less flashy than other aspects, but improving the process of finding new digital games is an underrated key aspect of a modern console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To start on a positive note, I&#8217;m pleased with the way Nintendo has improved the responsiveness of the eShop. I immediately noticed how much quicker and easier it is to navigate the store &#8211; gone are the painful moments waiting for the eShop to catch up with your inputs. Whether this is down to the increased hardware power, general eShop optimisation, or both, it improves the experience of browsing through the available games, and encourages curiosity as a result. In my book, that boost to game discoverability is a win for both the player and the developers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, whilst Nintendo has bolstered the options on the eShop main menu, it&#8217;s not as extensively as I&#8217;d hoped. Most of the options &#8211; such as the Search, Current Offers, and Coming Soon &#8211; are the same, and the only brand new addition is the For You tab, which recommends games based on your own gameplay trends. I was really hoping for some other additions, or even a review system so that players could help to recommend games for others. As it is, the eShop still has the problem of a constant inundation of new games &#8211; and whilst the Popular New Releases sub-section is a step in the right direction, any game that doesn&#8217;t qualify for this (or the Highlights tab) will get very limited time to grab player attention before the spotlight is taken by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14942" height="645" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14940" height="639" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14938" height="624" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14941" height="598" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of quality control, I reserve full judgement until more time has passed, but it seems that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t changed their approach. Lots of cheap-looking games are still flooding the eShop, and there are still Hentai games appearing relatively frequently. From my perspective, Nintendo could still do with raising the bar of entry, in order to curate a higher level of overall quality across the eShop. The current influx of these low-quality games worsens the issue of discoverability for other titles, which get mired amidst them despite taking much more time and effort to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the steps I&#8217;d still like to see taken for more eShop filtering options and better quality control, Nintendo has still significantly improved the eShop, especially in terms of responsiveness. Therefore, I mark this section as a success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More Power: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is that age-old request for new consoles &#8211; that they have more power, and are able to present games in higher framerates and resolutions. Since the Wii/DS era, Nintendo has rarely (if ever) been known as the technical powerhouse, with art direction, creative hardware, and recognizable IP being more important for bringing in players. That said, the Switch 2 is a big step up from the original Switch, with Nvidia claiming that it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nvidia-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">&#8220;10 times the graphical performance&#8221;</a> of the previous console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a technical expert, so I look for comparisons to other consoles to get a handle on where the Switch 2 lands power-wise. The general perception seems to be that at peak performance, docked on a TV, the Switch 2 is comparable to a PlayStation 4 Pro, but still behind the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles &#8211; which essentially matches my prediction back in March 2024. When played in handheld mode, the system is closer to a base PlayStation 4, but that is compensated for by the smaller screen, which often makes games look crisper to the eye (at least for me).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a hybrid system with a handheld option, battery life is another crucial factor to consider, and the increased performance does appear to have hurt the Switch 2 in this area. You generally get around two-three hours when playing any sort of intensive game, which can feel quite short. However, most of the time I don&#8217;t see this being an issue, unless I am on a very long journey &#8211; and it&#8217;s rare not to have a nearby place to plug in and charge. Whilst that isn&#8217;t an excuse, I prefer Nintendo providing stronger hardware and a shorter battery life rather than the opposite, so I&#8217;m still satisfied on this front. For example, I&#8217;m playing <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/09/17/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-14-09-23/">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em> at the moment, and occasionally having to charge the console is a small price to pay for how well it plays and looks in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14949" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14946" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14947" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14948" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When playing in handheld mode, the screen really is stunning; the increased size and power makes games look incredible, and it makes playing in bed (or wherever you prefer) feel like a luxury. The vibrancy and sharpness of the screen &#8211; especially when held close up for handheld gaming &#8211; gave me that new-generation-upgrade feeling that I was looking for. I&#8217;ve heard some disappointment that Nintendo didn&#8217;t use an OLED screen, but in my opinion the LCD screen is more than sufficient, and if it helps keep costs down then that&#8217;s a reasonable trade. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll get an OLED version of the Switch 2 (like for the original Switch) at some point too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only Switch 2-exclusive game I&#8217;ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em> (you can <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/10/mario-kart-world-review-a-stunning-racer-that-misses-a-few-tricks/">read my review here</a>), and as well as being a fantastic game, it doubles as an excellent technical showcase for the Switch 2. Played in 4K HDR on my TV, it looks sensational. The game moves with a crisp fluidity, and the environment feels palpably full of detail and colour. It was upon playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> that it really dawned on me that the Switch 2 was a major &#8211; and timely &#8211; graphical update on its predecessor, allowing it to keep fair pace with the technical state of gaming.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14934" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>All that graphical performance is needed to do justice to the beauty of Cow</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>All in all, whilst my test case for the Switch 2 is relatively limited for now (I haven&#8217;t played upgraded Switch games like <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em> yet either), I&#8217;m confident that the Switch 2 has delivered on the level of power I personally need in a Nintendo console. I don&#8217;t need it to be top-of-the-range; as long as the system is powerful enough to realise the trademark visual flair of first-party Nintendo games, and is able to house a strong line-up of new third-party releases, then that&#8217;s plenty for me. I eagerly await seeing what Nintendo can magic up with their bespoke Switch 2 games in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Clarity on Games: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads nicely into my next point, on the topic of the Switch 2 software line-up now and into the future. A console is defined by the games on it &#8211; and there were two particular games I was waiting for news on when I wrote that original post in March 2024. These were <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> and also the next Nintendo EAD game, which I predicted would be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game in the vein of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. We have received news on both of these games, even if the latter wasn&#8217;t quite the game I expected, as it has instead materialised as <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14932" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I am loving the vibrant purples in this art, by the way</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about <em>Metroid</em>. The development path of the long-awaited <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> has been turbulent, to say the least &#8211; after being announced back in 2017, Nintendo then publicly announced that they were restarting development in 2019, with Retro Studios (the developers of the original <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em>) coming back on board. When I wrote my post about my hopes for the Switch 2, we were still awaiting news on Metroid &#8211; but roughly three months later <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/06/19/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-18-06-2024/">in the June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, Nintendo finally showed us an announcement trailer for the newly-titled <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That initial trailer gave us a taste of the returning first-person <em>Metroid</em> gameplay and a glimpse of returning enemy Sylux, which kept fans occupied until February 2025, when it was announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM&amp;t=1631s">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> that <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> would be a cross-generation title on both Switch and Switch 2. Whilst unsurprising, this was welcome news &#8211; and roughly a month later in March, we got another Nintendo Direct trailer (see below), showing off more of the game and giving us a 2025 release date. This was followed up by an extensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9xes7BZto">Nintendo Treehouse video</a> in April, continuing the steady stream of new information on the game. However, as we enter September, we&#8217;re awaiting news on a precise release date, and I hope we hear more soon. Even if the game has to be pushed into 2026, I wouldn&#8217;t mind &#8211; after so long waiting, I&#8217;d prefer to wait a little longer if it means a better experience. What&#8217;s another few months after eight years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be fascinating to see the comparison between the Switch 2 and Switch editions of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>; the enhanced Switch 2 edition will have Joy-Con 2 mouse controls as well as support for 4K, HDR, and 120 fps! After seeing how brilliant <em>Mario Kart World</em> looks, I&#8217;m excited to experience a new <em>Metroid</em> adventure in these formats &#8211; I have a feeling the game will look sensational. So far, it appears that the game isn&#8217;t straying too far from the gameplay of previous <em>Prime </em>games, and instead refining the first-person formula, with some added tricks such as Psychic Abilities for Samus. I&#8217;m especially intrigued to see where the story goes, and am avoiding too many plot details until release!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, I thought <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was the more outlandish of the two games I was anticipating back in March 2024, as I was confident that a new 3D <em>Mario </em>from Nintendo EAD would be announced. I was both right and wrong &#8211; whilst we haven&#8217;t received a 3D <em>Mario </em>per se, we have gotten a new <em>Mario</em>-adjacent Nintendo EAD 3D game, in the form of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! This was the closing reveal in the Switch 2 Direct back in April; but it wasn&#8217;t until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Direct</a> in June that it was announced this isn&#8217;t just a Donkey Kong game, but a Pauline game as well, with a younger version of the character joining DK on his travels!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo EAD have an amazing track record, and the glowing critical reception to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>has been a continuation of this, praising the sheer gameplay creativity and enjoyment. One of the key features is the ability for Donkey Kong to smash through the environment, reshaping and even creating tunnels through it! The game released on 17th July, and I haven&#8217;t actually played it yet, as I haven&#8217;t found the time to justify spending the money on it. But now <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/">that I&#8217;ve finished the Pokémon League in <em>Pokémon Diamond</em></a> and am taking a break from that, I&#8217;ll hopefully soon get around to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, my next definite Switch 2 purchase will be <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, and I&#8217;m very tempted to get <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> too! There&#8217;s also the question about how series such as <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/10/25/where-can-zelda-go-after-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> might manifest on Switch 2, but I&#8217;m happy having patience &#8211; there are already so many other amazing games to play in the meantime!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More System Customization: No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, here we come to the first of my hopes that didn&#8217;t become a reality. The original Switch only allowed very simple customisation of the Home screen, and Switch 2 hasn&#8217;t evolved this at all, still only allowing two Themes: Basic White and Basic Black (my console is set to the latter). Having a Themes menu suggests the idea of having more options, but I&#8217;m not full of confidence, as we haven&#8217;t received any extra options since the original Switch launch in 2017.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14926" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I like neutral colours, but the option to add more flair could be fun</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not a software developer, it feels like Nintendo is missing an open goal by not allowing us to have Themes based on franchises such as <em>Mario</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, or <em>Metroid</em> &#8211; I honestly think people would even spend a small amount on these, in order to add vibrant new visuals to their systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that Nintendo could still add options in the future, but it&#8217;s disappointing that for now there&#8217;s no word on this. In my March 2024 post, I suggested extra options such as the <em>Nintendo Badge Arcade</em> sticker system on 3DS, but now I feel as if I need to keep expectations in check. At this point, even a couple extra Themes would be great to see.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14928" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Themes menu even seems designed to hold more options</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As on the original Switch, the main way of showing personality is through your profile icon. Nintendo has added extra customisation options over time, particularly via the Nintendo Switch Online menu, where you can unlock new characters, backgrounds, and frames for your profile icon. Whilst it&#8217;s a mostly unchanged process from the Switch, I&#8217;m glad this bit of customisation is still present. I imagine it won&#8217;t be too long until we get more Joy-Con 2 colours, so at least there should soon be that avenue for customising the look of your console (if you have the expendable income). Considering how popular the Switch 2 is, it&#8217;d be wonderful to see more done on the digital side to allow players to show their personality. I hope we see developments in this area in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Enhanced Social Features: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth and final entry on this list regards the social aspects of the Switch &#8211; in my original post, this was primarily about having improved voice chat functions, and thankfully, this is the main social aspect where the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade! After years (and multiple console generations) of players asking, Nintendo has finally added an in-built party voice chat to the Switch 2, named GameChat. It&#8217;s now possible to talk to your registered friends over the internet, using the in-built microphone in the Switch (and Camera, if purchased), even if they are playing different software. Whilst it isn&#8217;t revolutionary &#8211; after all, other consoles have had similar systems for a long time &#8211; it&#8217;s a welcome addition that I&#8217;m very happy to see Nintendo include for the Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous Nintendo consoles have had forms of voice chat, but they always had some sort of catch &#8211; for example on the Switch, where voice chat was tied to the Switch Online mobile app. So, it&#8217;s great to see Nintendo introduce a more complete and in-built offering &#8211; if anything, I feel a bit bad, because I doubt I&#8217;ll use it much. As the years have passed, I&#8217;ve gotten used to using Discord as an alternative form of online chat when playing Nintendo games, because it&#8217;s been more convenient &#8211; and I think it&#8217;ll be hard to break out of that routine. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m very glad GameChat has been added for the Switch 2, and I commend Nintendo for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I hoped to see some sort of extensive social hub added, along the lines of Miiverse or StreetPass. The closest is the Nintendo Switch App, which has new functionality such as uploading screenshots, receiving GameChat notifications, and (most intriguingly) interacting with games such as <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (see the images below). But I miss the in-built communal aspects of previous systems, as they brought people together without as much push towards a mobile app. We still have the News channels to get specific updates on the topics and games you choose to follow, but these are mostly one-way interactions. Nintendo has done well in previous generations at creating unique spaces for players to help shape the multiplayer culture of their consoles, but Switch and Switch 2 feel a bit more controlled in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14922" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14921" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14923" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another aspect that the Switch 2 still lacks is an equivalent to Achievements or Trophies. This is something I used to think was a glaring omission, as it would be a great extra motivation to 100% games such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/04/30/lets-chat-a-long-overdue-super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>. But <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/16/why-ive-stopped-caring-so-much-about-achievements-trophies/">as years have gone by</a>, I have gained respect for Nintendo not having this sort of system, whether it be by conscious decision or simply a lack of intention to do so. There&#8217;s something freeing about playing games on the Switch, and indeed, the Switch 2 &#8211; there&#8217;s a lack of TV/streaming apps, or completion-style Achievement/Trophy systems, and instead the focus is all on the act of playing games. That laser-focus is really refreshing, and I&#8217;m not clamouring for those additions at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, whilst I&#8217;d like to see an expansion into a more communal gaming hub in the future, the Switch 2 definitely delivered on my hope for enhanced social features. The addition of GameChat is one of the major upgrades for the Switch 2, and a lot of marketing and development focus went into it, which shows Nintendo listened to player requests for this type of addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After going through those five points, how has the Switch 2 fared when it comes to my personal hopes for the console? Four of my five points were met to some degree of success, which I mark as a win overall. Evidently, Nintendo recognised the general areas where improvements could be made &#8211; and whilst not all of them were as emphatic an upgrade as I may have hoped, the cumulative progress makes for a significant leap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarise, I&#8217;m going to rattle back through the main points. Firstly, the eShop is much easier and faster to navigate, but could still do with more options for filters and user reviews. In addition, the console is a step up in power, and whilst it isn&#8217;t at the level of modern Microsoft and Sony consoles, games look brilliant and the hardware keeps Nintendo in the ballpark for third-party games. Speaking of which, we have received welcome news on <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, and seen the release of a new exciting Nintendo EAD game in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, and now we wait for the likes of <em>Pokémon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and other franchises to launch on the console. Sadly, Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added much in the way of system customization, but it has delivered new social options in the form of GameChat, finally bringing in-built party chat to a Nintendo console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the admitted caveats to some of the &#8220;Yes&#8221; points, I want to focus on the positives of the Switch 2. This is because, despite the iterative nature of the console, it does achieve that new-console feel. I was worried that it might feel like another specification of Switch instead of a brand new thing, but there are enough upgrades to ensure that isn&#8217;t the case. Much of this is down to the optimized power of the console, and how much snappier and responsive it is to play. But another contributing factor is the hardware itself &#8211; in handheld mode, the larger form factor and sleeker Joy-Con 2 designs feels fresh and streamlined, and the console has made playing in bed (for example) feel like a delightful high-end experience. I will say, it helps that I have massive hands, so the larger console size is more comfortable for me personally.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14952" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d like to see Nintendo continue to make software improvements to the Switch 2 &#8211; for example new eShop features, new menu Themes, and extra social hubs &#8211; but I&#8217;m left with a firmly positive impression of the console overall. I&#8217;ve been getting back into playing games more frequently recently, and I&#8217;m glad to say that the Switch 2 has been a contributing factor to that; and if I&#8217;m playing more games and having a good time doing so, that marks the Switch 2 as a success in my book!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this post! There are lots of Switch 2 reviews and reactions around the internet, so I hope this before-and-after approach was a personal, distinct, and enjoyable differentiation. For those of you who purchased a Switch 2, I hope you&#8217;re having a brilliant time with the console &#8211; please feel free to let me know your own thoughts in the comments below!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/09/09/did-my-hopes-for-the-switch-2-become-a-reality/feed/', 'slash_comments': '3', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/switch-2-featured-2.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/switch-2-featured-2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png?w=576', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png?w=576', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png?w=576', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp', 'medium': 'image'}]}

As mentioned in that post, I was part-way through my first ever play through of <em>Diamond </em>at the time of writing. Of the two initial games (<em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>), <em>Pearl </em>was the one I got back in 2007, before then playing the third game <em>Platinum </em>when it released in 2009. I’ve kept my <em>Pearl </em>save to this day, whilst <em>Platinum </em>became the game I’d restart whenever I went back to play through Sinnoh &#8211; especially as it has extra content and various quality-of-life refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I hadn’t ever played <em>Diamond </em>until I felt compelled to buy myself a copy for £48.49 from GAME back in 2019. After all, <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>are second only to <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/07/11/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> in terms of my favourite games ever, so it’s lovely to have the complete set of three physical games. I’ve been gradually playing through <em>Diamond </em>ever since; in that aforementioned 2023 post, I noted that I’d reached the trek to Snowpoint City, roughly two-thirds of the way through the game. Since then, I&#8217;ve played a little bit more each year, finishing the villainous Team Galactic part of the main story, catching the cover Legendary Pokemon Dialga, and now preparing to tackle the Pokémon League!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-12 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14830" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14828" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14829" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14806" height="715" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve played through the Sinnoh-based <em>Pokémon</em> games, and the adventure feels a little different every time, for multiple reasons: , it might be the <em>Pokémon</em> team I choose, the approach I take, or how I’m feeling in my personal life at the time. With this being my first time playing <em>Diamond</em>, it&#8217;s felt unique once again &#8211; and as I gradually get ready to reach the end of the game (and start the postgame), I thought it’d be a nice point at which to write a journal-style post about the playthrough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, this journal approach matches my new writing method I’ve been testing, where I write a little bit every day, even if it’s just a paragraph or two. It’s helped me start posting at a more regular cadence recently, which I’ve really enjoyed, and am hoping to continue! I hope you’ll come with me on my retro-inspired ramble about my current adventuring in Sinnoh, and my plan to defeat the Pokémon League with a team that might be described as unconventional&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Shine Bright Like A&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this playthrough of <em>Diamond</em>, I decided not to create my character as “William”. I often style my avatar as myself on my first playthrough of a <em>Pokémon</em> game; but as I&#8217;ve played through Sinnoh many times before, I instead went for the approach I use on repeated playthroughs. In these situations, I like to create a new character persona, in a way that challenges my team selection, mixes up the gameplay, and allows me to add my own imaginary lore. Over the years, this has often led to me constructing a monotype team (usually Steel, my favourite type), but this time I went for a dichotomy theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14797" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14795" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The character I created is called Lucie, and I think of her as treading the line between both fiery and subdued personalities. Her starter is Chimchar, which will evolve into Infernape, one of the infamously few Fire type Pokémon in the core region of Sinnoh in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em> (the Elite Four member Flint has just two Fire types in their Fire-type team)! Two of the team slots are filled by a pair of Gastrodons (named Gianna and Gillian), a Pokémon which has two forms in Sinnoh: the pink West Sea Gastrodon, and the blue East Sea Gastrodon. By having one of each, it plays into that duality theming; I think of the pink Gastrodon as part of the &#8220;bright&#8221;, flamboyant side of the team, whilst the blue Gastrodon represents the &#8220;nocturnal&#8221;, subtler side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining the West Sea Gastrodon side of the team, we have the blazing Infernape (named Symphony), as well as Raichu (Ryland) and their electrifying moves. These Pokémon both deliver fast, strong damage: for example, Close Combat and Flare Blitz for Infernape, and Thunderbolt for Raichu. On the East Sea Gastrodon side is Noctowl (Miles), which has helpful status moves such as the sleep-inducing Hypnosis, as well as Skuntank (Skylah), which has Toxic for poisoning opponents and whittling them down. As you can probably tell, I&#8217;ve always liked to daydream up my own head canon for the characters and adventure. It helps every playthrough to feel unique, as if I&#8217;m adding extra world-building along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-14 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14793" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14791" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14787" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14788" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14790" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14789" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the team described above certainly isn&#8217;t the strongest possible for <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>&#8211; and I&#8217;m aware I&#8217;m making my life more difficult when it comes to battling the toughest trainers, such as the upcoming Elite Four and Champion Cynthia. But some of these Pokémon (especially Gastrodon, Nowtowl, and Skuntank) are Pokémon I&#8217;ve barely played with before, so I get to experience the challenge of Sinnoh in a brand new way! Mixing up the team helps every playthrough to feel fresh, and strengthens my personal connection with the team &#8211; not just now, but also when I look back on them years later, such as in a longevity app like <em>Pokémon HOME</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">A Girl&#8217;s Best Friend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;ve just finished working through Victory Road, reached the entrance to the Pokémon League, and completed the final fight against your in-game rival (on a whim, I named them Mervin). Relative to other games in the series, I&#8217;d argue that Sinnoh has the best Pokémon League &#8211; the members all have distinct personalities, and present a well-balanced challenge. The difficulty isn&#8217;t unfair, but requires you to take the League seriously; I&#8217;m currently in the phase of backtracking, training up the levels of my Pokémon, and refining the movesets, items, and strategies I&#8217;m going to approach the League with. With the team I&#8217;ve selected, it requires being very deliberate with my choices &#8211; of course, the main advantage I have is that I&#8217;m particularly familiar with the challenge that lies ahead, and can plan accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-15 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14817" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14811" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14821" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14820" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14818" height="168" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216" width="216" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14799" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sinnoh Pokémon League starts with the Bug-type trainer Aaron, who should be the easiest to defeat &#8211; Bug-types have many type weaknesses, such as to Fire and Flying, which my Infernape and Noctowl can target respectively. Next up will be Bertha and her Ground-type team, which will be a tougher test &#8211; the plethora of Ground attacks will be dangerous for Infernape and Raichu, so my two Gastrodons will be relied upon to use their Water-type moves. Noctowl has a useful immunity to Ground, and Skuntank can help out with Toxic, so my team has a decent amount of options for this battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is Flint, who as mentioned earlier, is a Fire-type trainer that curiously has three non-Fire types on their team. The two that are there &#8211; Rapidash and Infernape &#8211; should again struggle against the two Gastrodons, and then the rest of my team should be able to wear down Steelix, Drifblim, and Lopunny without too much issue. Then we&#8217;ll come to Lucian, the final member of the Elite Four, who has a Psychic-type team &#8211; and this is where Skuntank will have their turn taking centre stage, as their Dark typing makes them immune to Psychic moves. With the use of Night Slash (which has an elevated critical hit rate, boosted further by the equipped Razor Claw), Skuntank should carve through a lot of the opponents, with the help of Infernape to tackle the Steel typing of Bronzong.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-16 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14808" height="542" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721" width="721" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14810" height="548" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727" width="727" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing this plan out, it makes me fairly confident at defeating the Elite Four without too much trouble. However, players of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>know that the toughest challenge lies with Champion Cynthia and her excellent team of strong and varied Pokémon (which even includes a Gastrodon of her own)! The biggest threat is her ace Pokémon &#8211; Garchomp &#8211; which can likely take out most of my team with one hit from an Earthquake. My best options are going to be my two Gastrodons, which have strong defensive stats, and can use Blizzard and Ice Beam to hit the double Ice weakness of Garchomp. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll rely on Noctowl and Hypnosis, to give myself some more time. It&#8217;s going to be a nervy battle, but there are routes to success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">In Reflection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage of the game, where I&#8217;m backtracking and gradually training up my Pokémon, showcases some of why I adore <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>so much. In theory, this part could be tiresome, gradually grinding through the experience points needed to make my team stronger &#8211; but instead, I find it tranquil. There&#8217;s something magical about the way music, visuals, and gameplay combine in these games specifically, and I enjoy taking my time; one of the main places I&#8217;m training is Victory Road, as I can access a variety of strong wild Pokémon there. Near the entrance is a useful Pokémon Center for healing your team, and I often pause to listen to the &#8220;Pokémon League&#8221; music that plays outside it. This particular track has both &#8220;Day&#8221; and &#8220;Night&#8221; versions, and the latter is especially beautiful (you can listen below). It&#8217;s a beautifully delicate composition, and captures the feeling of being near the end of an amazing adventure, but with so much still left to enjoy, and no need to rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to this music is just one example of the catharsis I feel when playing <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, which is something I talked about back in my 2023 post. This sentiment comes from a place of both subjectivity and objectivity, as my emotional connection to these games is incredibly strong. After my older sister passed away in 2007, I spent hundreds of hours exploring Sinnoh, and I&#8217;m forever grateful to the soothing effect they had &#8211; and still have &#8211; on me. There are many positive aspects I associate with this: the meticulous sprite artwork and colour palette; the endearing Pokémon and character designs; the region full of secrets to explore; the sprawling Underground; and that amazing soundtrack, just to name a handful of reasons why I love these games so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I prepare to enter the Pokémon League, I&#8217;ve also started thinking about the postgame, which in <em>Diamond </em>includes a whole separate island northeast of Sinnoh, named the Battle Zone (see the map below). It includes the Fight Area, Resort Area, and Survival Area, plus Stark Mountain. The Fight Area includes the Battle Tower in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>, which is less extensive than the expanded Battle Frontier in <em>Platinum</em>, but still offers plenty of challenge and longevity. I love the sheer amount of space left to discover in the postgame; this island is like an extra enclosed region to explore. Currently, I&#8217;m undecided on whether I&#8217;ll dive straight into this after the Pokémon League, or take a break and come back at a later time.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14813" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I&#8217;m well acquainted with the celebratory feel of the Battle Zone island, and may well get drawn into playing it immediately! After the high of defeating the Pokémon League, it&#8217;s wonderful to realise there&#8217;s still so much left for your Pokémon and you to explore. The Battle Zone has a vacation vibe, especially as you initially take a ship to get there &#8211; and the music is also uplifting and energetic, for example Route 225, which feels like a burst of energy, complete with the iconic clapping (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQvx9STW1V0">go to 00:42 in this video</a>)! Overall, the Battle Zone has a celebratory feel, and adds a lot to the overall package of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. I&#8217;m excited for the character of Lucie to extend her adventure, and take her dual-themed team onwards and upwards!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Space and Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope with this post is that it shone a light on two things: the reasons that set this playthrough of <em>Diamond </em>apart, and more detail on why I have such a strong connection to <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. They are such special games to me personally, and for a long time, I&#8217;ve considered how to do that connection justice on this site. The 2023 post was a very cathartic one for me to write, and this post is an extension of that. It&#8217;s amazing how our personal circumstances can affect our thoughts on games (and other forms of media) &#8211; and I love hearing about these stories from other people too, as it often sparks positive discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14850" height="514" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827" width="827" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that down the line, I get to write another post about <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, talking about how the character of Lucie faced the Pokémon League, and then ventured into the postgame and Battle Zone. Down the line, I&#8217;ll likely inevitably play <em>Pokémon Platinum</em> again, and that&#8217;ll continue to be the game I go back to for replaying Sinnoh. For now though, I&#8217;m glad to have completed my physical set of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>games, and to be nearing the final stages of <em>Diamond</em>, with plenty of gameplay hours still ahead to look forward to!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for reading, I sincerely appreciate it. I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a brilliant day!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-featured-2.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-featured-2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827', 'medium': 'image'}]}

This is the first brand new <em>Mario Kart</em> on consoles since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> on Wii U back in 2014 (the Switch received an upgraded version, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, in 2017, which I skipped) &#8211; so at least for me personally, it&#8217;s felt a long time coming. Mixed in with the excitement of a brand new Nintendo console, it made the launch of <em>Mario Kart World</em> feel like a real event, especially when played with friends, which is where <em>Mario Kart</em> always excels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, in various different configurations: both on the TV and in handheld, in solo, local co-op, and online with a friend. Now, I&#8217;ve reached a point where I feel I can state a comprehensive opinion on the game, having experienced both the racing modes and the open world that&#8217;s a major selling point of this iteration of <em>Mario Kart</em>. My thoughts are overall very positive, but there are also some flawed aspects to the game  &#8211; but I&#8217;ll expand upon this more later on in the review. Without further ado then, let&#8217;s get into it!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Start Your Engines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it was the new-console glow, or perhaps it was that wait since <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, but launching into <em>Mario Kart World</em> for the first time felt distinctly special. The game encourages you straight into exploring the open world first; this consists of the various tracks connected by open spaces of road, field, water, desert, and more. What&#8217;s immediately remarkable about the game is just how gorgeous it looks, both in handheld but also especially when played on a 4K HDR TV &#8211; and whilst this isn&#8217;t new technology, it&#8217;s wonderful to play Nintendo games in such high fidelity via the Switch 2. The visual direction of <em>Mario Kart World</em> makes brilliant use of the new hardware, presenting a world full of vibrancy, colour, and personality &#8211; which is shown in the track designs, whether it&#8217;s the bustling Shy Guy Bazaar, the scrumptious Sky-High Sundae, or the fiery Bowser&#8217;s Castle, just to name three!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-17 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14727" height="574" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mkw_sgb_view.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14724" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14725" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_17.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The infused personality is evident in the roster of characters (complete with various different unlockable outfits). Returning are your usual suspects like Mario, Luigi, Peach, and so forth; additionally, there are plenty of newcomers, including minor enemies such as Konkdor and Cataquack, and even bit-part characters such as Dolphin and, of course, Cow! If you&#8217;ve seen any discourse about <em>Mario Kart World</em> since the initial announcement, you&#8217;ll know that the Cow and their adorable grin has captured the attention of the internet, and I&#8217;ve had a wonderful time watching the various memes and edits their inclusion has spawned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the characters have a range of changeable outfits too, which are unlocked by collecting Dash Food bags from vendors in races or the open world. It adds an extra way to differentiate the characters, ranging from punk rock biker looks to desert outfits and much more in between &#8211; and they can be combined with the plentiful different karts and bikes to create the aesthetic you&#8217;re looking for. A Photo Mode has been added in tandem with this, giving plentiful options for taking pictures that show off the world and characters as you see fit. Me being me, I&#8217;m sad that we got an Explorer outfit Toad but no actual Captain Toad&#8230; But there&#8217;s always time for that in DLC, hopefully!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14754" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A smorgasbord of Yoshi! Or Yoshis? Yoshies?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The attention to detail in both audio and graphic effects is especially apparent when you build up speed. Karts and bikes camber side-to-side when they hop and drift; tyres are spongey and visibly bounce and recoil according to the track surface; and sparks crackle off your vehicle as you drift and build up a boost, just to name a small handful of the details I&#8217;m talking about. I particularly like the tension of drifting around the sharpest corners, with the screen often tilting with you and making it extra satisfying to hit the apex. Plus, the music is noticeably exceptional, supplying a consistently energetic chorus that accentuates the gameplay &#8211; especially in the final unlockable tracks, which supply a climactic crescendo unlike any other I&#8217;ve experienced in <em>Mario Kart</em>. Overall, the whole experience is lifted by this pristine look and feel, whether it&#8217;s the relatively laid-back open world, or the competitive modes, where the palpable sense of momentum is most gripping. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a Knockout!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the &#8220;World&#8221; being a key selling point of the game, it&#8217;s still those core competitive modes that retained the tightest grip on my attention. Whilst the expected familiar selection of Grand Prix, custom VS, Battle, and Time Trial modes are all here, the game deserves credit for also introducing a brand new main mode to go alongside Grand Prix. This goes by the name of Knockout Tour, where 6 different tracks are combined together into one extra-long race. It takes advantage of the increased count of 24 racers to introduce checkpoint gates along the way, eliminating those at the back each time. Essentially, it&#8217;s a way of introducing popular battle royale-esque sensibilities into <em>Mario Kart</em>, and it creates a very fun sense of chaos &#8211; especially in local multiplayer, when your friends and you are desperately trying to stay in the race amidst the various items flying around!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14736" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A road trip across the Mushroom Kingdom! Thankfully, less traffic jams than real life</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Knockout Tours are arguably the biggest challenge awaiting completionist solo players in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It&#8217;s classic knowledge now that to get the maximum 3-star rating in Grand Prix, you need to win all four races; but in Knockout Tour, you need to be leading through every single checkpoint! This is an extremely tough task, as it necessitates not just victory, but to be consistently leading &#8211; even despite homing Red Shells, or the dreaded blue Spiny Shells that target the leader. I set myself the personal challenge of 3-starring every Knockout Tour, and it led to many failed attempts, but it was highly satisfying when I finally achieved that goal. For <em>Mario Kart</em> veterans, it&#8217;s a good addition to have a target that takes this extra level of dedication to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just mentioned the items and the chaos synonymous with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and that side of the game is just as entertaining (and frustrating) as ever before! To me, <em>Mario Kart</em> is similar to other games such as <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> because at their core, each iteration is built on the same gameplay loop, and it makes it tough to critique a new entry &#8211; on one hand, it&#8217;d be unwise to stray too far from what makes the series so immensely popular, but on the other, there has to be enough new ideas to justify a new game that still feels imaginative.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-18 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14737" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14738" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14740" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As aforementioned, the Knockout Tours are a standout way in which <em>Mario Kart World</em> achieves the latter, and some of these ideas bleed over into Grand Prix, where you don&#8217;t just drive around four tracks &#8211; instead, after the first race, the initial laps are rolling starts, as you drive across the world to the next track, road-trip style. It&#8217;s a neat way to keep the same formula but match it to the open-world aesthetic of <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and in VS there are options to play either in this mode, or with the traditional laps, catering to either preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further to this, there are tweaks to the racing itself, the most notable arguably being the new parkour/trick abilities. If you drive up onto a rail, you can grind along it and perform extra trick boosts, and you can even trick onto a wall and wall-ride along it, which opens up jaw-dropping shortcuts if you master this ability (there are plenty of astonishing clips doing the rounds online)! On top of this, drifting boosts can now be used in a straight line, and launch you off the ground slightly to help initiate some of these parkour moves. In combination, all these extra options elevate the height of the skill ceiling, and keep <em>Mario Kart World</em> engaging for those who have mastered previous entries in the series. Crucially, it does this without losing the accessibility as a go-to local multiplayer party game &#8211; the extra skills are a cherry on top for those who want to go above and beyond, but they&#8217;re not essential for winning races against the CPU.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14755" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Boo Cinema is another standout track, which applies a film filter to part of the course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Items are one of the infamous levellers of <em>Mario Kart</em>, and there have been some tweaks and additions on this front too. Your usual roster of shells, bananas, and mushrooms, and more are all here, although it&#8217;s noticeable that the raw power of items such as Bullet Bill have been slightly softened, perhaps to accommodate the new racer count of 24. Some of the notable new items include the golden Coin Shell, which leaves a trail of coins behind it, and the feather, which leaps you into the air, opening another opportunity to perform tricks, wallrides, and other shortcuts. To more literally aid more inexperienced players, there are still the helpful options for motion controls, auto-accelerate, and driving aids. Whilst these aren&#8217;t new, they&#8217;re still great to see return, and are often essential for balanced 4-player sessions that everyone can enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Give Me a Boost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As fun as <em>Mario Kart</em> can be in solo play, multiplayer is where the series has always shined brightest, and that continues to be the case for <em>World</em>. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to play with several combinations of friends, and the game has impressively accommodated their varying levels of <em>Mario Kart</em> experience each time, whether they&#8217;re a fresh newcomer or someone who&#8217;s been away from the series for a while. It&#8217;s easy to criticize the items when they&#8217;re hitting you, but they do a great job at helping those towards the back stay with the pack, and there&#8217;s still the option to use items such as shells and bananas defensively whilst in the lead.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14743" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Expect to shout at your friends &#8211; in a pleasant way, of course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Local multiplayer has consistently resulted in a brilliant time, complete with the playful shouting, cheers, and competitive back-and-forth that you hope for from <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; so I can report that it&#8217;s a success in that department! My favourite local multiplayer option is the extended custom VS modes, which have plenty of customisable options, including speed, difficulty, item frequency, and the amount of races, which go up to 32 at a time. As a big Formula 1 fan, I love to nerd out about the accumulated points and the drama of how the final standings will end up, so VS will inevitably become my most-played mode!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of online play, <em>Mario Kart World</em> doesn&#8217;t quite hit the same heights as local multiplayer, because of that lack of immediate in-person reaction &#8211; and whilst it&#8217;s admirable that Nintendo has added chat functionality, I did end up defaulting to using a Discord call instead, because of the familiarity and ease of use. The main motivation to play online is to raise your versus rating (VR), which is essentially the same system we had way back on <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>. In my opinion, it&#8217;s disappointing that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added more reasons to play online, especially in a gaming landscape where online games consistently add new modes, tournaments, and other rewards for playing consistently. The end result is that I quickly fell off of online multiplayer, and have focused mostly on solo and local multiplayer.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14753" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Driving on water supplies opportunity to perform tricks as you bounce over the waves</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, I found that the returning Battle Mode was most ideal for multiplayer &#8211; in <em>World</em>, there are two options, Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, which will be familiar to players of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. Balloon Battle gives you five balloons to protect whilst doing your best to hit opponents and earn points for removing their balloons, and Coin Runners has you searching for as many coins as you can, whilst again attempting to hit others and remove their coins (whilst avoiding them doing the same to you). I have to say, I&#8217;ve never been a huge Battle Mode fan over the years, and this version hasn&#8217;t changed that &#8211; but conversely, if you love Battle Mode, this will fill that quota well. My main disappointment is that the modes are time-based instead of score-based, as I generally prefer having that concrete target and the tension of seeing who can reach it first. Despite my criticisms, I am glad Battle Mode is back, as it offers a welcome change of pace from the racing modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Free as a Birdo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, a major differentiator for <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the inclusion of a free roam mode, where you can explore the tracks (and the spaces between them) at your leisure. There&#8217;s certainly an immediate novelty to this &#8211; I have nostalgic memories of <em>LEGO Racers 2</em>, which I played a lot on PC as a child, and included a similar experience of exploring an open world between races in a colourful, family-friendly world. My hope was that <em>Mario Kart World</em> might recapture that whimsical feeling, and supply a world with plenty of secrets and rewards, and most importantly motivation to find them. At first, <em>World </em>is successful in this; one of my earliest ventures was rocking up to the Dino Dino Jungle area, and visiting the inner laboratory/auditorium section. With precise driving and the careful use of tricks, you can make your way to the top of this area &#8211; which is thrilling the first time, but soon the realisation kicks in that there&#8217;s a lack of reason to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-19 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14746" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14747" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14745" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in free roam,<em> Mario Kart World </em>has an uncanny sense of emptiness, and it&#8217;s partly because that palpable sense of forward energy &#8211; which is so prevalent in the competitive modes &#8211; is gone, without being replaced by much else. It&#8217;s not that there isn&#8217;t anything to do in the open world &#8211; for example, there are Peach Medallions and Question Mark Panels to find, as well as P Switches that activate various challenges &#8211; but the problem is that there isn&#8217;t much motivation to track all these things down. The main rewards are stickers, which are small graphic icons you can attach next to your profile name, and feel inconsequential. More work needed to be done to make the world feel alive, and not just like a suspended state of limbo from the Grand Prix mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toads and Shy Guys milling around and making campfires are a great touch, but they&#8217;re another short-lived novelty that doesn&#8217;t add substance to the experience of navigating the open world. It&#8217;s fun to find items and complete challenges, but they&#8217;re incredibly scattered &#8211; and whilst there&#8217;s a tracker for the Question Mark Panels, there&#8217;s curiously no in-game indicator for how many Medallions or Switches are left to find (and also no statistics or records screen for other modes, either). On the other hand, something free roam does do well is increasing the level of awe the world has. You can travel a long way out into the ocean, and discover sea dragons, whales, and more, and I had a great time inspecting the scale of impressive courses such as DK Spaceport. As mentioned at the start of the review, <em>Mario Kart World</em> is a stunning game to look at and listen to, and the open world gives you more time to do just that.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14748" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>P Switch challenges often consist of time trials</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s a great shame that there&#8217;s no formal splitscreen multiplayer for the open world &#8211; there&#8217;s a partial workaround, by loading into an empty wireless mode lobby, but challenges are turned off, and it&#8217;s not at all optimal. In a game marketed on free roam, and in a series known for local multiplayer, it&#8217;s a disappointing oversight that significantly reduces the reason to play this way. I have occasionally played free roam in single-player as a laid-back secondary experience, for example when listening to a podcast or talking to friends &#8211; but it has untapped potential as a playground for friends to enjoy together, and honestly, I think this would&#8217;ve papered over many of my problems with the emptiness of the open world. Instead, more often than not, you&#8217;ll launch straight into Grand Prix, Knockout Tour, or VS, as that is where the most joyous parts of <em>Mario Kart World</em> reside.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to the end of this review, I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;ve flagged multiple issues I have with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; so I need to re-emphasize that this is a genuinely excellent <em>Mario Kart</em> game, that not only delivers the best-looking and best-sounding entry into the series, but has multiple new ideas and modes that make it feel distinct. Changeable character outfits, new trick mechanics, and especially the Knockout Tour mode supply fresh style that have made <em>World </em>my new go-to local multiplayer game, and a game I&#8217;ve spent many an enjoyable hour in by myself as well. The main disappointment has to be the free roam mode, which feels sparse and quickly struggles to retain player attention &#8211; and I really hope that in the future, Nintendo supports the game with additional content that fills out this world more. Alternatively, add Captain Toad to the playable characters, and I&#8217;ll probably be happy, haha! In all seriousness, <em>Mario Kart World</em> definitely has flaws, but the core racing experience is dazzling, and it&#8217;s a superb way to start the Switch 2 era!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

I&#8217;ve written about this in multiple posts on this site, and I&#8217;ve noticed how I&#8217;m gradually getting deeper into the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> ecosystem: starting with looking back to the anime, and then playing the online game <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and now getting more invested in learning about the current meta and competitive side of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> is a complicated game with lots to learn (and relearn) for someone like me, who hasn&#8217;t been up-to-date on the meta since I stopped playing local tournaments about a decade-and-a-half-ago. But I&#8217;m slowly learning, and I&#8217;m enjoying how it&#8217;s happening naturally, via watching various YouTube creators, playing different decks in <em>Master Duel</em>, and even constructing a real-life deck that I could conceivably return to local tournaments with. So, in this post, I&#8217;m going to talk a little more about these various aspects of the game, the deck I&#8217;m playing, and why I&#8217;m enjoying this process so much!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Getting the Fire (Kings) Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve already written about <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/12/31/why-im-giving-yu-gi-oh-master-duel-another-shot/">how I&#8217;ve gotten back into <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em></a>, but only now have I reached the point where I&#8217;m starting to understand the competitive meta. At first, I was playing relatively low-powered (by current standards) decks such as Dark Magician and Monarchs, because those cards were familiar to me. But realistically, those decks aren&#8217;t fast-paced enough to keep up nowadays, so I started testing other avenues. I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of Gravekeepers, which can sometimes work in the competitive scene, if you draw the right cards (such as Necrovalley) in order to shut off abilities from the opponent. But this wasn&#8217;t a strategy that was going to help me learn the competitive game long-term, and I found that I eventually reached a point of repetition and subsequent burnout playing the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-20 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14664" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14665" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14666" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gravekeepers brought me a decent level of success!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This brought me to the HERO cards, especially Destiny HEROs, as I have a nostalgic affinity for them. The modern HERO cards have many combo effects that special summon various powerful cards, so they were much more helpful for learning the increased modern speed of combos in a deck. But I still found the HERO cards to lack flexibility for different situations, and I again reached a point where I hit a brick wall with the deck. It felt like I had hit also hit a wall in my efforts to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> in a contemporary fashion, as I couldn&#8217;t find a deck I clicked with. So I took a bit of a break from <em>Master Duel</em>, and started looking into which decks would be viable to assemble if I was playing the physical TCG (Trading Card Game). After looking at various Structure Decks as starting points, I finally found one which made sense to test out: Fire Kings!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire Kings are a deck based around monsters that destroy themselves either on the field, in the hand, or from the deck, to then activate various effects, including summoning monsters and destroying cards on the field. In addition, they have an impressive boss monster in &#8220;Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings&#8221;, which can destroy every other monster on the field (and has a magnificent summoning animation in <em>Master Duel</em>, see below)! The fiery aesthetic of these cards is well-realised in the stunning artwork, which mixes regal distinction with blazing power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-21 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14678" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14674" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14676" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14677" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14675" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Master Duel summon animations are, in a word, awesome</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the cards are relatively accessible in the real world, with only &#8220;Fire King Courtier Ulcanix&#8221; demanding a higher price point (of about £15 a copy). Most of the main Fire King cards can be acquired in the modestly priced Fire King Structure Deck &#8211; I bought three copies of this, as well as some other products (such as the recent Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Deck, which includes reprints of staple cards such as Infinite Impermanence), to construct a real-life Fire King deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, I find it helpful to have a real deck in front of me, which I can draw test hands with to slowly understand the playstyle better (I&#8217;m hoping for a reprint of Ulcanix, so I don&#8217;t have to drop £45-ish on a playset)! The result of this process is finally finding an archetype I like, which is viable to build in both <em>Master Duel</em> and the TCG &#8211; and to top it all off, Fire Kings are competitively strong too! Whilst they aren&#8217;t currently considered a top tier deck like Maliss or Ryzeal, Fire Kings do perform well in current competitive play, even winning the YCS Birmingham event this year, piloted by Dinh-Kha Bui! This tells me that if I can improve my own skill and understanding of the deck, then Fire King can reach a high ceiling of play in both <em>Master Duel</em> and local tournaments (should I decide to go&#8230; More on that later)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14669" height="696" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>It needs some changes still, but my TCG Fire King deck is taking shape!</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m playing lots of Fire King in Ranked games on <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and with every game, every new scenario, and every mistake I make (I&#8217;m admittedly still making a lot of those), I&#8217;m learning the intricacies of the deck, how to perform the best combos, and how to make the strongest boards in combination with my Extra Deck of Link, XYZ, and Synchro Monsters. I like how Fire Kings have such a strong Fire connection, which enables them to make use of several non-Fire cards as additions to the deck. For example, a common choice for Fire Kings is &#8220;Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames&#8221;, which can revive back one of your Fire Kings alongside it when summoned. This synergy is very satisfying, and ties into the overall theme of the deck, resulting in an archetype that feels richly-designed and well-realised. I&#8217;m enjoying learning the Fire King strategies, and I hope that by my next <em>Master Duel</em> post on this site, I can report that I&#8217;ve become steadily better at piloting the deck!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Creators I Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside my own proactive efforts to become better at contemporary <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I&#8217;ve been watching several YouTube creators that are a brilliant source of both entertainment and knowledge for me. <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/">In previous posts, I&#8217;ve mentioned</a> how TGS Anime and Team APS helped me get reacquainted with classic <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, which lines up with my aforementioned play of anime decks such as Dark Magician. I still watch these channels, but I&#8217;ve added several others to my regular watchlist, including the &#8220;wonky quartet&#8221; of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGuDrveqBgD0S9nqaOPw6Q">Farfa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MBTYuGiOh">MBT</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Nyhmnim">Nyhmnim</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dzeeff">Dzeeff</a>, who consistently create great content focused primarily around <em>Master Duel</em>. Often, they add fun variables to challenge themselves, such as in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xajsij7iS98">Master Chef</a> series by MBT, or the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbldWY88--A">Storage Wars</a> series by Farfa.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Videos like this (by Joshua Schmidt) are brilliant at showcasing both the fun and skill of </em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly thanks to these channels and their collaborations, I&#8217;ve also become aware of other popular YouTubers &#8211; specifically, ones focused around high-level competitive play. These are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaSchmidtYGO">Joshua Schmidt</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jessekottonygo">Jesse Kotton</a>, who are well-known for often winning or placing highly in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> tournaments. Both of them balance speaking confidently about modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> with also making videos that are fun to watch, which is very impressive and makes them stand out. Both their channels have been helpful to me, and I also like it when they have those earlier-mentioned collaborations with channels like Farfa and MBT, as they bring a little bit of extra seriousness to those videos. Discovering this range of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> players and creators has been an unexpected extra positive side effect of getting back into the game and franchise!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">It&#8217;s Time to Duel?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;ve talked about how I&#8217;ve not just been looking at the digital version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> (with <em>Master Duel</em>), but also my physical collection of cards as well. I have a fairly large amount of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> cards, mostly from my childhood and teenage years, and further supplemented with occasional more recent purchases when something has stood out to me. Those Fire King and Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Decks have given me access to plenty of modern cards to assemble a deck with, and I also picked up products like the Duel Devastator set from 2019, which was full of guaranteed competitive staples like &#8220;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&#8221;. This is all to say that I&#8217;m nearing a place where not only am I improving at <em>Master Duel</em>, but I could conceivably go to an in-person event near me and test out my skills in person (scary, I know, haha)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14673" height="672" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Recent structure decks have been ideal for helping me build Fire Kings</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Jokes aside, there&#8217;s only a few things stopping me from doing this, and one of them is overcoming that social anxiety. I&#8217;ve become better at this over the years, but I definitely find the initial ice-breaking of heading to a new club/group quite daunting. About a year ago, I also experienced this when joining a nearby running club &#8211; there is that initial awkward stage of getting to know people and faces, but it gets easier over time. I&#8217;m confident that this wouldn&#8217;t be a long-term issue, especially as I now know a friend who has introduced me to a local store that hosts Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next barrier is more closely related to the theme of this post &#8211; and that&#8217;s a personal target to be relatively well-acquainted with the game before showing up to a local tournament again. I&#8217;m definitely nearing this stage, and part of this preparation would be making the finishing touches to my Fire King deck. I&#8217;d like to get that playset of three Fire King Courtier Ulcanix first, as they&#8217;re integral to the strength of the deck. The card is out of stock on most sites, and my best route currently seems to be waiting for a good UK price on Cardmarket. I could wait and hope for a cheaper reprint, but there is no sign of this happening at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jesse Kotton has a video about Fire Kings and their affordability</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I&#8217;d like to get a copy of some extra staple Extra Deck cards such as &#8220;S:P Little Knight&#8221;, and possibly acquire some extra non-Fire King cards that often seen play in the deck, such as &#8220;Bystial Magnamhut&#8221; and &#8220;Bystial Druisworm&#8221;. The main thing I&#8217;m keeping an eye on is price &#8211; for example, in an ideal world I&#8217;d also add competitively strong cards such as &#8220;Mulcharmy Fuwalos&#8221; to the deck, but that would cost another £70-ish for a playset, and I haven&#8217;t even gone to a local event yet (I do have a tendency for overthinking)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve still not decided if I&#8217;ll make the time to make the leap to playing the TCG in-person again, but I&#8217;m getting increasingly tempted to have a go. It would enable me to test out my skills, and it could also be a way to make new friends and connections. When I went to local events in my teenage years, I enjoyed the trading side of the game too &#8211; and who knows, perhaps that&#8217;s a better way to acquire some of these missing cards for my Fire King deck. If I do decide to go, I hope to write up about my experience on this site, however well (or badly, haha) it goes!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the third <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> centric post I&#8217;ve written over the last 8 months, and they&#8217;re good reflections of how I&#8217;ve gotten back into the franchise as a whole: not just my nostalgic connection, but how I&#8217;ve been learning about the modern game and how it&#8217;s evolved over time. I admittedly used to be someone who lamented that <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> had become too complicated and suffered from power creep &#8211; and whilst those aren&#8217;t completely untrue, I think they were oversimplifications on my part. Having now taken the time to ingrain myself back into the world of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I see that the game has developed into something new &#8211; something faster, more complex, and in some ways arguably better than before.</p>\n\n\n\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top: 75%;">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this post has explained how I&#8217;m pushing myself to get better at the game, with the conduit of a Fire King deck as my resource for playing the game at a higher skill level than before. I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn still, both about this deck and other decks, but I&#8217;m having an excellent time doing so &#8211; which is probably evidenced by me considering playing the TCG in-person again at some point in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this post, and I sincerely hope you are happy, healthy, and having a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/03/how-fire-kings-are-helping-me-learn-competitive-play-in-yu-gi-oh-master-duel/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Somehow we&#8217;re already into the second half of the year &#8211; so much has happened and I&#8217;ve gone through a lot of personal growth because of it (including an eventful end to the marathon&#8230; )!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks as ever to all those reading my posts every month, even with my slower posting schedule &#8211; I never stop appreciating it! Right then, let&#8217;s get into the post, and I hope you enjoy the read!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Edinburgh Marathon 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/">my build-up and training for the Edinburgh Marathon</a> multiple times since I started planning in November 2024, and after a train journey up to Edinburgh and a couple of days in the city, on May 25th 2025 the day finally arrived for my first marathon! My parents and some close friends were there to support me, and I also had the support of all those who contributed to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">my charity fundraiser for Beat</a> (the Eating Disorder charity). Thank you to everyone who donated or even just took a look at my Justgiving page &#8211; I&#8217;m really proud to spread awareness for a charity that means a lot to both my family and I.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14636" height="607" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So, you may be asking, how did the marathon go? It was a tough one, and Scotland threw all the elements at us. There were periods of sun, rain, strong winds, and even hail when I reached approximately mile 20! As expected, the last 10-ish miles are where the battle really begins, as much mental as physical. It was important to me that I do my absolute best and never stop or walk if I can help it, and at mile 25 I got to see my friends and family cheer me on as I neared the finish line!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was an unexpectedly dramatic finish. With the finish line in sight, and as I pushed for the line with maybe 100 metres left to go, I was struck with the notorious &#8220;jelly legs&#8221; and fell. I managed to get back to my feet with the help of another nearby runner, and made it to the line. As someone who is very critical of themselves, I was disappointed at not finishing the run in better style &#8211; and this is where my family and friends were invaluable at stopping me from being too harsh on myself. It was a great reminder of how much they care for me and how much support I had on the day, and I am incredibly grateful to them and everyone else who has congratulated me since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-22 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14624" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Early on&#8230; !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14622" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the race</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14623" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final stretch!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Including Gift Aid, we raised £1,821.77 for Beat, and I&#8217;m very proud of this, as well as the personal achievement of finishing the marathon. I&#8217;m still deciding whether or not to do another marathon &#8211; after not finishing in quite the way I hoped, I am feeling motivated to do another one, maybe the Norfolk Marathon in 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest gaming news stories over the last few months has been the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. As not only a gaming fan but also specifically a Nintendo fan, I got my console immediately, and have been playing it a significant amount since! Whilst it&#8217;s more of an iteration than a revolution in terms of hardware, I personally enjoy the larger console and screen size, as it fits my larger hands very well. The only exclusive game I have so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I&#8217;ve put many an hour into!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14620" height="534" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, <em>Mario Kart World</em> feels like the first new entry since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> many years ago, as I played a lot of the latter on Wii U and never felt the need to buy the <em>Deluxe</em> version on Switch. Therefore, <em>World</em> feels very fresh to me, and it&#8217;s also visually spectacular (especially on a big 4K HDR TV). I&#8217;ve 3-starred all the Grand Prix and am now working away at the Knockout Tours, which are battle-royale style checkpoint races new to this game. These Knockout Tours are very tough to get 3-stars on, but I&#8217;m enjoying the challenge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a few criticisms of the game &#8211; including my own biased disappointment at no inclusion of Captain Toad, haha &#8211; but also about the open-world twist on the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula. In concept, it&#8217;s a smart way to go, but I have mixed feelings on the execution, as the world feels a little empty and repetitive to explore. Despite this, I&#8217;m going to save my full thoughts, as I plan to write a dedicated review at some point soon. One thing is for sure, and that&#8217;s <em>Mario Kart World</em> being the new go-to local multiplayer game for my friends and I!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the Switch 2 itself, it does feel like an investment for the future, as outside of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and now <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> (which I hope to play soon), there&#8217;s a lack of headline exclusive titles. But for now, the hardware upgrade and promise for the future &#8211; plus the fun of <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; has made it feel worth the purchase for this Nintendo fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-text-align-left">My watching habits have been quite eclectic recently! In terms of the films, the standout has to be <em>Superman</em> &#8211; as a huge DC fan, I had high hopes for this fresh, brighter take on the iconic character, and James Gunn and company thoroughly delivered. The film is a shining beacon of positivity, fun, and creativity, and David Corenswet is a brilliant Superman to centre the new DCU around. I&#8217;m very excited to see where things go in the future, but for now I&#8217;m just so happy that we got a satisfyingly hopeful take on Superman again. I&#8217;m hoping that these vibes continue in <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> on the Marvel side, which I&#8217;m going to see tomorrow as of writing this!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-23 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14617" height="1023" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg?w=819" width="819" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14618" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg?w=691" width="691" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of TV, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to <em>The Walking Dead</em> (I really liked the recent film <em>28 Years Later</em>, and I think it&#8217;s helped put me in the zombie mood). I originally stopped watch <em>The Walking Dead</em> in Season 8, which is where a lot of people dropped off, in the war between Rick and Negan. However, I heard that it picks up afterwards, so I decided to go back, charge through Season 8, and see what I find in those last few seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst Season 8 remains a poorly-paced season, I&#8217;m glad I went back, especially because Season 9 is brilliant TV. Clearly lessons were learned from the negative reception to previous seasons, and Season 9 focuses back on character development, inventive new threats, and grounded emotional stakes. It hooked me in and I&#8217;m enjoying the ride of these last few seasons!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m already looking ahead to watching the newer <em>The Walking Dead</em> spin-offs such as <em>The Ones Who Live</em> and <em>Daryl Dixon</em>, to see where these characters end up. Other than <em>The Walking Dead</em>, I&#8217;m also slowly making my way through the latest Marvel show <em>Ironheart</em>, which hasn&#8217;t been marketed very well by Disney &#8211; which is a shame, as it&#8217;s very well-made and full of great performances.  To loop back around to <em>Superman</em> and the DCU, I&#8217;m also eagerly anticipating <em>Peacemaker</em> Season 2, which will tie into that film and the larger world!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this summation of some of what I&#8217;ve been up to recently! One of my goals for the rest of the year is to start writing here more consistently &#8211; I&#8217;ve been saying this for a while, but it&#8217;s something I really want to get back to. It&#8217;s been necessary for me to spend more time on my personal life and take breaks from writing, but in the process of that personal growth, it&#8217;s reminded me how much I like writing about the things I play, watch, and do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I often get distracted or hit writer&#8217;s block, so I&#8217;m considering the approach of setting aside a little bit of time every day to write with no background music/videos, as opposed to my previous strategy of writing in big time chunks all at once.

Many hours of my weekends have been devoted to building up my distance; I am a longtime runner, but had never ran more than a half-marathon before my marathon training this year. Last weekend I did my longest run, a 23.2-miler (my poor legs), and I&#8217;m now tapering down before the big day. My mental health has been low recently, and the marathon has been a good target for my mind to try and focus on, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14584" height="560" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025"><em>https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m both excited and nervous for the event, for which I will be journeying to Edinburgh a few days beforehand. I&#8217;m also doing the run to fundraise for <a href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/">Beat, the Eating Disorder charity</a> &#8211; this is a cause close to my heart, as my amazing sister Charlotte passed away in 2007 after battling anorexia. As aforementioned in my previous post, you can view my Justgiving page <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">at this link</a>, and any donations would be very much appreciated, but there&#8217;s no pressure at all to donate!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Upcoming Book Projects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a designer for Titan Books, I get to work on some really exciting projects, and honestly that fulfilment in my work means a lot to me &#8211; it&#8217;s very rewarding to have a physical product of your work, especially when it&#8217;s related to a property (such as Marvel or <em>Star Trek</em>) that you enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get to experience working on several exciting film retrospectives, and some upcoming ones from Titan include books on <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>,<em> </em>The Crow films, and <em>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</em>, which you can see covers for below!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-24 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14562" height="904" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706" width="706" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14564" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800" width="800" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14563" height="927" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of fiction, the final Mike Hammer novel <em>Baby, It&#8217;s Murder</em> released recently, and there are upcoming Marvel paperbacks for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Annihilation</em> and <em>Doctor Strange: Dimension Wa</em>r.

I&#8217;m very impressed by what was shown, and have my pre-order in for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. Whilst I like physical media, I can&#8217;t justify that high £74.99 price point for buying <em>Mario Kart</em> separately. Those game prices are the main criticism so far &#8211; the only other hesitation is seeing Nintendo choose surety over innovation in terms of hardware. I&#8217;m confident the Switch 2 will be a huge hit, but I do slightly miss those eclectic reveals of the Wii U, 3DS, Wii, DS, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what I&#8217;m playing, I&#8217;ve been struggling with burnout and game-playing-motivation recently, so haven&#8217;t played much. I have however briefly gotten back into<em> Bravely Default</em> on the DS (which ironically has a Switch 2 version coming soon), and continue to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel </em>now and then. I&#8217;m hoping my game-playing motivation returns soon, but am also not putting too much pressure on myself, as I don&#8217;t want to force it. I look forward to the Switch 2 hopefully reigniting that fire a bit &#8211; oh, and please add Captain Toad to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, Nintendo! It would make me very happy indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve admittedly struggled to get back into games recently &#8211; but when it comes to TV, I&#8217;ve been keeping more up-to-date, and there&#8217;s a lot that I&#8217;ve been liking recently! The second season of <em>Andor </em>and second (or fifteenth, depending on how you count) season of <em>Doctor Who</em> are currently airing, and both are fantastic. <em>Andor </em>continues the engrossing drama and brilliantly tangible visual design of the first season, and this era of <em>Doctor Who</em> is really hitting a stride, with unexpected surprises amidst the brilliantly imaginative stories. I really hope the rumours of <em>Doctor Who</em> taking a break after this season are false, as Ncuti Gatwa is sensational, portraying a charismatic and emotionally healed Doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also just finished watching through <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Netflix-verse of Marvel TV (especially<em> Jessica Jones</em>), so to see some of those characters returning has been wonderful. The series feels like both a reinvention and a continuation of the original three <em>Daredevil </em>seasons, and I&#8217;ve been thrilled by how well it has turned out. The character work, cinematography, and courtroom/political intrigue is all here, and I am stoked for Season 2 &#8211; I just hope some of the Defenders do turn up in Season 2, including not just Jessica Jones, but Luke Cage and Iron Fist too!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a quick rundown on what I&#8217;ve been doing, playing, and watching! I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this quick update &#8211; I think of this site like my own digital journal, so even when I take a break, I always like to come back with some sort of update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really hope you are happy and healthy, and that you are having a wonderful week. See you next time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mikehammer_babyitsmurder_fc.jpg?w=666', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/81tvyzi3mvl._sl1500_.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doctorstrange_dimensionwar_salescover-1.jpg?w=678', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/godzillamovienovelization_omnibus_salescvr_dec24.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}]}

So, any omissions are not necessarily a negative reflection on that game &#8211; more likely, it just didn&#8217;t make the cut for this post, especially as I want to take this chance to include expansions that don&#8217;t always get the limelight they deserve. It&#8217;s been hard cutting it down to six choices!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summation, this list isn&#8217;t a definitive ranking, but instead a personalised list of six brilliant game expansions that I&#8217;d like to give some attention to, and explain why I have a personal connection with. Also, please go and read the original article that inspired me over at Game Praisers, which you can do <a href="https://gamepraisers.wordpress.com/2024/12/18/the-best-expansions/">by clicking here</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right then &#8211; onto my list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/29/horizon-zero-dawn-review/">greatly enjoyed <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a>, it didn&#8217;t take much convincing for me to download the expansion <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>! With such an expansive and imaginative open world, it&#8217;s a double-edged sword when it comes to DLC; on one hand, you know people like this world, but on the other, you really have to make the expansion stand out from that world to set it apart. For <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, this is done with a new area named The Cut, full of cold weather, dangerous new machines such as the Scorcher, and intriguing story reveals that bridge the gap between <em>Zero Dawn</em> and the sequel <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/03/30/horizon-forbidden-west-review/">Forbidden West</a></em> (incidentally, the only reason I haven&#8217;t included the <em>Forbidden West</em> DLC on this list is because I don&#8217;t have a PS5 to play it on)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cut is full of activities for main character Aloy, whether it be exploration, narrative, or combat &#8211; including optional super-hard combat trials for the real masochists among us. The local tribe (named the Banuk) tie into the aforementioned overarching story, and as Aloy discovers literal machinations under the snow-covered surface of The Cut, it increased my anticipation around where the sequel will go next &#8211; which is surely a sign of a successful DLC. When I wrote <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/02/14/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds-review/">my review for <em>The Frozen Wilds</em></a> back in 2018, I also noted how it made small steps to improve dialogue animations (which were sometimes quite static in the main game), and you can see how that was continued to full fruition in the dynamic conversations of <em>Forbidden West</em>. Not only is <em>The Frozen Wilds</em> substantial and utterly beautiful to look at, but it actively improves the gameplay foundation of a series I adore.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Mass Effect 3: Leviathan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious choices when it comes to <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC are the fantastic <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> for <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, or the <em>Citadel </em>DLC that served as an epilogue for <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. However, the expansion I have the strongest personal connection to is <em>Leviathan</em>, the first of the <em>Mass Effect 3</em> DLCs. I only bought an Xbox 360 shortly before <em>Mass Effect 3</em> launched, and that game was my gateway into the series (I went back and played the entire trilogy afterwards). After mainly playing on Nintendo consoles beforehand, the concept of single-player expansions was relatively foreign to me &#8211; but after being so enraptured by <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, I was incredibly excited at the prospect of more story content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ending of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is infamous for being disappointing to many people &#8211; but in a way, it made me more excited for DLC that would further flesh out the backstory of the giant world-destroying Reapers that you face throughout the trilogy. <em>Leviathan </em>is all about the discovery of a secret race named (you guessed it) Leviathans, who predate even the mysterious Reapers. In the DLC, you journey across space to piece together morsels of information about their origins. I particularly like the planet 2181 Despoina, a planet covered in water and full of secrets and intense combat situations. That sense of discovering places that were meant to be hidden forever is thrilling, especially when you get to the climactic moments that reveal how the Leviathans play into the wider battle against the Reapers &#8211; and it&#8217;s that rush of energy that makes <em>Leviathan </em>stand out as my favourite <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker &#8211; Special Episode</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very happy when <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> got a Switch release, as it allowed even more people to play this gem of a game &#8211; and I was even happier when in early 2019, a new selection of levels was added with the <em>Special Episode</em> expansion! Whilst this isn&#8217;t a large single-player story expansion like some of the other games I&#8217;ve included in this list, I wanted to highlight this DLC for <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, as it&#8217;s a joyful addition with plenty of value for money (currently £5.39 on Switch). Also, yes, I&#8217;m biased for Captain Toad, but that&#8217;s besides the point, aha&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who haven&#8217;t played <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, it&#8217;s a delightful puzzle game that sees Captain Toad and Toadette make their way through levels based on Hakoniwa Japanese box gardens, with the player rotating and shifting the levels around in order to progress. The <em>Special Episode</em> adds 5 brand new levels and 13 challenges that reinvent previous courses, so 18 new levels to play through in total. As with the main game, there&#8217;s a lovely variety, from haunted caves full of Boos, to a treacherous ship, to another minecart ride! As <em>Treasure Tracker</em> is presented in several book chapters, the DLC additions fit in smoothly, and I&#8217;d frankly happily play as many levels as Nintendo is happy to add (I really hope we get a sequel one day)! The <em>Special Episode</em> is a wonderful and endearing addition to <em>Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Dragon Age: Inquisition &#8211; Trespasser</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a brilliant time with all of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> DLCs, but it&#8217;s the final DLC <em>Trespasser </em>that&#8217;s my favourite of the bunch. Requiring story completion to play, it&#8217;s a definitive end &#8211; and cliffhanger &#8211; to <em>Inquisition</em>, even preventing you from returning to the main game afterwards. The plot brings the player to a summit assembled to decide what happens to the Inquisition now that the main threat has been ended, but soon a new conspiracy is discovered. This eventually reveals that Solas (an eleven mage who&#8217;s a consistent presence in the <em>Dragon Age</em> series) is secretly Fen&#8217;Harel and the Dread Wolf. He&#8217;s been responsible for many of the magical occurrences that have played a part in the game, and he&#8217;s now seeking to collapse the Veil that separates worlds, despite the catastrophic consequences it&#8217;d cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For players who&#8217;ve spent many hours around this character who they thought was on their side, it&#8217;s a dramatic reveal that created a lot of excitement for the sequel to <em>Inquisition</em>. Solas even cuts off the arm of the main character to prevent them stopping him, before disappearing and leaving the player with the decision of whether the Inquisition should be continued or disbanded. <em>Trespasser </em>does have competent combat elements too, but the story is the focus here, and it&#8217;s always been memorable thanks to the anticipation it created for the sequel. However, despite <em>Trespasser </em>releasing in 2015, we only got <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/08/04/dragon-age-the-veilguard-why-im-optimistic-what-id-like-to-see-next/">The Veilguard</a></em> at the end of 2024, so it did leave a lot of time for players to stew and theorize!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Resident Evil 5: Lost in Nightmares/Desperate Escape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I first played <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/02/resident-evil-5-review/">Resident Evil 5</a></em> in 2020, and I did so on PS4, where both the DLC expansions <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> and <em>Desperate Escape</em> are bundled in with the main game, so I&#8217;m going to include them both together for the purposes of this list. Whilst <em>Resident Evil 5</em> certainly has flaws, it also has a lot to praise, such as how it leans into cinematic storytelling. The two DLCs act as a prequel and an in-between-quel, and give an opportunity to play as series mainstay (and <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/23/my-5-favourite-video-game-characters/">my favourite <em>Resident Evil</em> character</a>) Jill Valentine, as well as the pilot Josh Stone. Firstly, <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> is set before <em>Resident Evil 5</em>, and shows Jill and Chris Redfield infiltrating the Spencer estate to confront Albert Wesker. We see snippets of this encounter &#8211; which leaves Jill presumed dead &#8211; during the main game as flashbacks, but here we get to play through it all: puzzles, combat, and Wesker boss fight included. Jill and Chris are the quintessential <em>Resident Evil</em> partners, so it&#8217;s comforting to see them interact (well, as comforting as it can be when facing down monstrosities).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Desperate Escape</em> is set towards the end of the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> campaign, just after Sheva Alomar and Chris manage to free Jill from the mind control of Wesker. Whilst the former pair go after Wesker in the main game, we never got to see how Jill and Josh made their own way out, and we get to play that out for ourselves here. This is arguably the tougher DLC of the two, less puzzle-focused and more about, well, desperately escaping &#8211; ending with a horde-assault sequence that gets frenetic on the higher difficulties. Both DLCs are great for different reasons, and as a combo add a lot to the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> story experience. Jill getting her time to shine is great too, especially as she wasn&#8217;t playable in the main game. This is timeline-wise the last time we got to play as Jill in the main story, too &#8211; please take the hint, Capcom&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The Last of Us: Left Behind</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You knew this had to be on here, right? In my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> rose the bar for story expansions, just like <em>The Last of Us</em> rose the bar for narrative video games. <em>Left Behind</em> fits into the later portions of <em>The Last of Us</em>, after Joel is near-fatally injured, and Ellie is hunting for medical supplies in an abandoned mall. This forms part of Left Behind, but it&#8217;s also interspersed with flashbacks to three weeks before the main game, where Ellie is taken by her friend Riley to break into another abandoned mall in Boston &#8211; and this is where the DLC shines at its brightest. As with many of the other expansions in my list, the core gameplay is a solid continuation of the main game, but it&#8217;s the story advancements and believable character interactions which leave the strongest impact here, giving us brand new information on Elie and her backstory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the best parts of the DLC aren&#8217;t fighting infected, but instead when Riley and Ellie are exploring the desolate mall. They find carousels, video games, and plenty more to play with and talk about. The in-gameplay dialogue that <em>The Last of Us</em> uses so well is continued here, resulting in a moment between the two girls that is both natural and surprising, especially for blockbuster games at the time. It&#8217;s all interwoven with that bittersweet sense that something bad is going to happen &#8211; after all, this is an apocalyptic world, we didn&#8217;t hear much about Riley in the main game, and we know Ellie gets bitten at some point. Those moments do come, but they maintain all their dramatic impact because of the masterful way Naughty Dog combines gameplay and narrative (and also because of brilliant performances by Yaani King as Riley and Ashley Johnson as Ellie). As I said at the start &#8211; in my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> raised the bar for story expansions, and it&#8217;s still one of my favourites to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>With that, we come to the end of the list! As mentioned earlier, there are plenty other great DLC expansions out there, but these are six of my own favourites, each for their own specific reasons. Thanks again to Dryad at Game Praisers for the inspiration for this post!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this also got you thinking about your own favourite gaming expansions &#8211; I&#8217;d love to hear about your picks, so please feel free to let me know in the comments!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have an amazing week!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/03/09/6-of-my-favourite-video-game-expansions/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/expansions.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/expansions.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Therefore, I thought I&#8217;d give a quick overview of what&#8217;s been added to the game and why I&#8217;ve found it so rewarding!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Look to the Skies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s immediately obvious which archetype Konami is pushing with this event &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the Sky Strikers, who were introduced back in 2018 and have become incredibly popular since. The first two <em>Master Duel </em>anniversaries tied into Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so it&#8217;s admittedly a shame we don&#8217;t have a Red-Eyes Black Dragon event to round out the central three <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> Duel Monsters characters of Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey &#8211; but I suppose the power of the fan-favourite Sky Striker characters Raye and Roze was just too strong!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14502" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14515" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14519" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png" width="2560" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop is filled with new items featuring board backgrounds, player mates, card backs, a deck box, and more focused around the Sky Strikers, plus admittedly stunning alternate arts for the main Sky Striker cards. I&#8217;m not an expert on the archetype, but all the amazing artwork and shiny bonuses definitely has me intrigued to learn more about the characters!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of&#8230; The new solo Story is unsurprisingly focused around the Sky Strikers. However, what makes this even more special is the addition of animated sequences within the Sky Striker story, which have been taken from the upcoming anime <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME: THE CHRONICLES</em>. For those who don&#8217;t know, Konami recently announced that this anime will be starting in April 2025, and will be focused on the actual card lore itself. So, instead of revolving around duels (like <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em>, <em>5D&#8217;s</em>, or <em>Arc-V</em> did, for example), <em>CHRONICLES </em>will be set within the world of the cards, which is very exciting!

The animation is vibrant and expressive, and it&#8217;s great to see this willingness to expand on the card lore &#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely be checking these anime episodes out as they release. Also I have to mention that the new UI for the solo mode is much improved and more player-friendly, segmenting the various solo stories up in a cleaner way, which I appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Festival Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next major addition to <em>Master Duel</em> is the two Festivals that are happening this month &#8211; the first one, Legend Anthology, features a custom banlist that excludes common staples, such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. In theory, this shakes up the meta within the mode, especially with three pre-made decks ready for players to use. However, this mode is dominated by the new Exodia deck and cards, in particular The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate, which can reach upwards of 10000 ATK and can also negates card effects. Often, the match is decided on the coin flip, as if a player goes first and gets out this Exodia card, it&#8217;s extremely hard to the opponent to stage a comeback. Still, the mode has plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, so it&#8217;s worth grinding through.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14511" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14510" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14509" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m much more excited for the upcoming Fusion X Synchro Festival (starting 17th February), which will restrict the Extra Deck to only Synchro/Fusion monsters, and cut out all the options that Link and XYZ monsters have added. I&#8217;m growing to respect those newer card types more over time, but it&#8217;ll still be fun to play some games that make players revert to pre-XYZ strategies. Hopefully it&#8217;ll allow some of my older classic decks to be a bit more viable (at least briefly)! Just like the Legend Anthology, there are plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, which should make it worth the playtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Plenty of Prizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that has always pleasantly surprised me about <em>Master Duel</em> is how generous it is as a Free-to-Play game. The 3rd Anniversary is timed with the start of a new Duel Pass, which is a 700-Gem purchase that &#8211; if you complete it &#8211; earns you all your Gems back, as well as cosmetic and in-game currency rewards, such as a background themed around the aforementioned Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate. If I had to suggest improvements, it would be for a few more unique cosmetic rewards in the Pass &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to complain too much about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the Sky Striker items I mentioned earlier, the shop also has a new Structure Deck full of the expensive HERO cards, new Selection Packs that include those new Exodia cards, as well as another chance to buy previous Anniversary-exclusive items themed around Blue-Eyes White Dragon. As someone who took a long break from <em>Master Duel</em>, I appreciate this a lot, and am slowly working my way through acquiring these.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14517" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14512" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14514" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The deck that&#8217;s currently giving me the most success is my anti-meta Gravekeeper deck, which I&#8217;ve fine-tuned to include more drawing cards and be more reliable (see the decklist image above). I&#8217;ve also finally put together my Destiny HERO deck, which is more meta, and features more Extra Deck combo cards. For long-term success in <em>Master Duel</em>, I need to learn more of these combo plays (and how to combat other combo decks), so I don&#8217;t want to stick with anti-meta decks like Gravekeepers for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my quick summation of the new <em>Master Duel</em> features and how they&#8217;ve positively affected the game &#8211; I&#8217;m really enjoying the amount to do right now, as well as the continued support Konami is bringing. I&#8217;m still slowly re-acclimatising myself to <em>Master Duel</em> after such a long time away, but I&#8217;m continuing to enjoy it and play a few duels every day. If anyone else is intrigued in giving the game a shot, I&#8217;d say now is an ideal time to jump on board, as the game is offering many player-friendly rewards that not only play on nostalgia for <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, but also relate to future projects like the <em>CHRONICLES </em>anime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this quick article &#8211; and if you&#8217;re playing <em>Master Duel</em>, let me know how you&#8217;re finding it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Over 50,000 visitors are expected per day, for 4 days, so over 200,000 visitors in total (which aren\'t necessarily 200,000 different people, as some people come on several days). This makes the Spiel the biggest tabletop game convention in the world, about three times as big as Gen Con, the biggest North American convention. But Essen is smaller than Indianapolis, so the ratio of fair visitors to city inhabitants of the Spiel is about 5 times that of Gen Con. That makes visiting the Spiel somewhat of a logistical challenge.<div><br /></div><div>As I now live just an hour and a half drive away from Essen, two years ago my wife and me tried to just go there on Thursday morning by car. It turns out that traffic around the fair area is extremely congested even hours before the fair. And while there are multiple parking garages, they are all full. We ended up parking illegally at the side of the road somewhere 10 minutes walk from the fair. So last year, we decided to take a hotel room from Wednesday to Thursday. By luck, we found a room somebody else had cancelled. Hotel rooms during the fair are extremely hard to find, and "surge pricing" triples the cost of a room to sometimes over $500 a night. This year, despite booking in January, I couldn\'t find a room anywhere near the fair, and had to take a room downtown.

Many of the visitors queue before the entrance already well before the doors open, as they want to rush in early and get whatever hot game before it sells out. So this year I plan to turn up a bit after the opening time of 10 am. As in the previous years I always left the fair in the afternoon on Thursday, this year I plan to concentrate on Thursday afternoon and stay until closing time at 7 pm.

The world\'s largest tabletop game fair is a surprisingly horrible place to buy a tabletop game. The place is just packed, and last year one stand selling a highly desired game on Thursday had a queue of over 1 hour to buy the game. Getting to the stand with the game you want is already a challenge. Getting to see the game is hard, getting 5 minutes of basic explanation is harder, and getting to play it is nearly impossible. Whether you can buy the game depends a lot on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/geekpreview/78/spiel-essen-25-preview?sort=hot" target="_blank">how popular the game is on the previews</a>, and how many copies of the game the publisher actually managed to bring. Some games are sold out before noon on the first day. Last year, I only bought two games at the fair itself. Which was just as well, because the crowd in some places means that even just walking forward turns into more like a shuffle, and if everybody is carrying several bought board games, foot traffic gets even slower. Large Cajon backpacks are prohibited, but a lot of people have trolleys, which also make walking in a crowd difficult for everybody. I think I\'ll just bring the classic Ikea bag.</div><div><br /></div><div>While getting a hot new game at the Spiel is nice, it isn\'t why I am there for. Ideally I want to see many different games, even games I am not yet aware of. I am mostly looking for games that can be played in under 3 hours, including set up and explanation, for my board game nights. That limits how complex the game can be. Then there are secondary considerations, about how much I like or dislike certain game mechanics, or how much the theme of the game appeals to me. If I like a game, and it isn\'t available to buy at the fair, I can still mail order it later.

Over 50,000 visitors are expected per day, for 4 days, so over 200,000 visitors in total (which aren\'t necessarily 200,000 different people, as some people come on several days). This makes the Spiel the biggest tabletop game convention in the world, about three times as big as Gen Con, the biggest North American convention. But Essen is smaller than Indianapolis, so the ratio of fair visitors to city inhabitants of the Spiel is about 5 times that of Gen Con. That makes visiting the Spiel somewhat of a logistical challenge.<div><br /></div><div>As I now live just an hour and a half drive away from Essen, two years ago my wife and me tried to just go there on Thursday morning by car.

The game already started badly: In classical JRPG fashion, there is a sort of tutorial to teach you about the world, your place in it, and the basics of gameplay. And that tutorial is 4 hours long, unless you skip all that endless dialogue and exposition. It doesn\'t help that a good chunk of that time is taken up by black loading screens; they are only a few seconds long, but they happen extremely often. A real throwback to the time of PS2 and PS3 titles.<div><br /></div><div>Finally I got into the city and the real game began with me being introduced to the calendar system. This was new to me, as I haven\'t played any of the Persona games. I was told that I had 10 days until some calamity struck, so I had to finish a certain dungeon by that time. No problem, I thought, as the preparation before that, including doing city quests to reach Wisdom 2, which opened up the purification feature and a side dungeon quest, only took a few days. So I entered the main dungeon, and was starting to have fun. 8 hours later I had finished both the side dungeon and the main story dungeon before the time limit, when the game decided to slap me in the face and told me that I did it wrong.</div><div><br /></div><div>You see, these dungeons have "rest" areas called Magla Hollows. But you can\'t actually rest there, only save the game and do some dialogue. They don\'t fill up your magic points, which are the main limiting resource in dungeon runs. However, then the game introduced me to the option of using the Magla Hollow or other save points (in the form of a cat) to teleport back to the entrance. From there I could exit back into the city, rest properly in a tavern, and then get back into the dungeon, teleporting right back to the Magla Hollow. Great! Basically exchange a calendar day for a mana refill. Should be fine, as long as I don\'t need more days than the time limit. <b>Wrong!</b> It turned out after the dungeon that you get any calendar days not used in the dungeon as free days, which you can use to increase your virtues, bonds with other characters, do quests, or grind. These free days are extremely valuable, especially at the start of the game. And I had basically wasted them, by using the outside rest option whenever my mana was a bit low, instead of wringing the maximum out of each magic point.</div><div><br /></div><div>For me, good game design has failing forward options: If you aren\'t doing that well, the game should help you along in order to not fail at later, even more difficult challenges. Metaphor Refantazio reminds me of Valkyria Chronicles in as far as these games have failing backwards systems: They make the game easier for you if you played in a specific developer-intended "perfect" way, and punish you if you play casually, try out things, and are "inefficient" by very specific metrics. That is especially galling if you either need knowledge from previous games or guides, or get the information about what you should have done later in the game, and should basically replay parts of it "optimally" to get the best rewards.</div><div><br /></div><div>So I read some guides and tips about Metaphor Refantazio, and was told something I otherwise would have learned only much later in the game: Each character has an ultimate archetype, but you can only play that one, if you ranked up very specific archetypes throughout the game. If you are again playing casually, and try out a wide variety of archetypes on each character for fun, you might get to a point where you simply don\'t have the time to still level the archetypes you need high enough to fulfill the conditions for the ultimate archetype. Unless you use a very specific exploit that allows you to farm infinite amounts of archetype xp. So, hey, I\'m kind of happy that my Game Pass subscription ends in a week, and I won\'t be able to reach the end of Metaphor Refantazio anyway. Because if I have the choice of playing a RPG either for maximum fun while trying out a lot of things, or for maximum efficiency, I\'ll always choose the fun. Even if the game at some point would tell me that now I can\'t finish the game, due to all the accumulated penalties for not playing perfectly. I call that bad game design.</div><div><br /></div><div>Apart from the failing backwards design, Metaphor Refantazio is fun enough in a very classical way. It does look a bit old-fashioned, compared to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which I just played recently. But the archetype system and the turn-based combat are all very entertaining. The story and world aren\'t half bad, although again a bit more classical: In my 12 hours I did fight a lot of wolves, goblins, skeletons, and a minotaur, but also a few more original monsters, weirdly called "humans". I am totally fine playing this game for another week, and then stopping somewhere in the middle.

The developer Amplitude has a good reputation to improve their games over time, and this might become a great game in a year or so.

Belgium holds a record for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%932011_Belgian_government_formation" target="_blank">running the longest time without an elected government</a>, for 589 days in 2010-2011. The interesting thing about that was how it was organized: Everything continued to function, state employees were paid, benefits were received, the ordinary citizen didn\'t even notice there was no government.

Because the truth of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of governments in history spent more than their revenue and accumulated debt.</div><div><br /></div><div>Every government spending is fundamentally redistributive. If you build schools, taxpayer money from childless families is redistributed to the benefit of those who have children. Social safety nets like health care and welfare tend to redistribute money progressively, from the rich to the poor. But there are also a lot state expenditures like business subsidies that redistribute money regressively, from the poor to the rich. And taxes also can be more progressive or more regressive. End of last year in the UK, there were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj71zyy934o" target="_blank">protests against a tax</a> that specifically targeted only a loophole in inheritance taxes for over&nbsp;£1 million, where millionaires like Jeremy Clarkson pretended to be poor and unable to afford such a tax. Many countries have loopholes that enable most millionaires and billionaires to not pay any inheritance tax at all. Warren Buffett famously declared that he was paying a lower tax rate than his secretary, as in many places passive income from investment is taxed a lot lower than active income from work.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am old enough to remember US government shutdowns, which were at least in part motivated by Republican fiscal hawks trying to stop Democrats from tax and spend policies. But that idea ended around the turn of the millenium. These days neither party is even remotely trying to balance the budget, and the US national debt has gone up from under $6 trillion at the turn of the millenium to over $37 trillion today. Why?</div><div><br /></div><div>My theory is that Republicans discovered that national debt is in fact not bad for the people they represent. Ultimately the national debt is only one more government expenditure, for interest payments on that debt. Taxpayer money is redistributed to the holders of treasury bonds. And that is by nature a regressive form of redistribution, poor people don\'t own treasury bonds. National debt provides a baseline, so-called "risk free" rate of interest, which is important for financial markets. So a lot of people with savings, and a lot of bankers, would be unhappy if the US had no national debt.</div><div><br /></div><div>Right now, the Democrats profit from the government shutdown by painting the Trump administration as inefficient and cruel, while the Republicans profit by it providing a convenient excuse to cut government spending they don\'t like, e.g. for federal employees. Behind the blame game, there is bipartisan support *for* a shutdown. So this isn\'t ending anytime soon. Unfortunately, if it ends, it will end with a compromise on more government spending, not less. There is no political party left with any interest in a balanced budget or a decrease of national debt. The UK learned under the short premiership of Liz Truss how that can quickly go wrong at some point. It is a political game of hot potato, where every administration hopes it will be the next one that has to balance the budget due to a bond market crisis. You gain votes by promising free money and low taxes to your voters, and you lose votes by balancing the budget and lowering the national debt. And even if the US government can\'t technically default, because they can print their own money, that too has consequences. There is no such thing as free money.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'I live in Belgium.

But there are also a lot state expenditures like business subsidies that redistribute money regressively, from the poor to the rich. And taxes also can be more progressive or more regressive. End of last year in the UK, there were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj71zyy934o" target="_blank">protests against a tax</a> that specifically targeted only a loophole in inheritance taxes for over&nbsp;£1 million, where millionaires like Jeremy Clarkson pretended to be poor and unable to afford such a tax. Many countries have loopholes that enable most millionaires and billionaires to not pay any inheritance tax at all. Warren Buffett famously declared that he was paying a lower tax rate than his secretary, as in many places passive income from investment is taxed a lot lower than active income from work.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am old enough to remember US government shutdowns, which were at least in part motivated by Republican fiscal hawks trying to stop Democrats from tax and spend policies. But that idea ended around the turn of the millenium. These days neither party is even remotely trying to balance the budget, and the US national debt has gone up from under $6 trillion at the turn of the millenium to over $37 trillion today. Why?</div><div><br /></div><div>My theory is that Republicans discovered that national debt is in fact not bad for the people they represent. Ultimately the national debt is only one more government expenditure, for interest payments on that debt. Taxpayer money is redistributed to the holders of treasury bonds. And that is by nature a regressive form of redistribution, poor people don\'t own treasury bonds. National debt provides a baseline, so-called "risk free" rate of interest, which is important for financial markets. So a lot of people with savings, and a lot of bankers, would be unhappy if the US had no national debt.</div><div><br /></div><div>Right now, the Democrats profit from the government shutdown by painting the Trump administration as inefficient and cruel, while the Republicans profit by it providing a convenient excuse to cut government spending they don\'t like, e.g. for federal employees. Behind the blame game, there is bipartisan support *for* a shutdown. So this isn\'t ending anytime soon. Unfortunately, if it ends, it will end with a compromise on more government spending, not less. There is no political party left with any interest in a balanced budget or a decrease of national debt. The UK learned under the short premiership of Liz Truss how that can quickly go wrong at some point. It is a political game of hot potato, where every administration hopes it will be the next one that has to balance the budget due to a bond market crisis. You gain votes by promising free money and low taxes to your voters, and you lose votes by balancing the budget and lowering the national debt. And even if the US government can\'t technically default, because they can print their own money, that too has consequences. There is no such thing as free money.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/6831409446988143800/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/6831409446988143800', 'title': '1 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6831409446988143800'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6831409446988143800'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/10/debt-budget-and-shutdowns.html', 'title': 'Debt, budget, and shutdowns'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '1'}

Why?</p><p>I\'ll start by talking about my university days. I started as one of 108 students at that university in the chemistry department. By the time I got my diploma (masters degree), there were only 32 of us left. The other 70% had dropped out, having failed too many exams. On the other hand, we paid just 49 bucks in tuition per semester, so while we still had to pay for our cost of living and study materials, the financial burden was a lot lower. But that was in the 80\'s and 90\'s and in Germany.</p><p>Higher education has a lot fewer dropouts in the USA. The "overall status dropout rate" for high-school dropouts has gone down from 14.1% in 1976 to 5.3% in 2022.&nbsp;For colleges, between 1996 and 2017, the share of first-time, full-time students not graduating within six years fell by about 9 percentage points, from 44.6% to 35.5%. On the other hand, in the US over the last five decades, tuition cost has gone up by a factor of 4 *after* adjusting for inflation, and student loan debts are now&nbsp;the second-largest category of consumer debt after mortgages.</p><p>If you add up all those numbers, you realize something: The higher education system in the US doesn\'t treat the young people coming there as students, but rather as clients. In exchange for a rising fee, they will do their utmost to make sure you get the degree you are paying for. Educational standards be damned. On paper, that makes the US highly educated: From <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/fig_2.png" target="_blank">1940 to 2021 the percentage of population age 25+</a> without a high-school degree dropped from 75.9% to 8.9%, while the percentage of people with a bachelor\'s degree or more rose from 4.6% to 37.9%.</p><p>There are only two problems with that: The first one is that people who graduate from college in 2025 are a lot less educated than those who graduated 50 years ago. Especially over the last few years,&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/" target="_blank">AI has literally made students dumber</a>.&nbsp;One in five employed American adults with a bachelor’s degree <a href="https://www.opencampus.org/2021/06/10/a-troubling-lack-of-skills-in-literacy-and-numeracy/" target="_blank">lacks important skills in literacy, with one in three falling below proficient levels in numeracy</a>. A weird mix of economic incentives for teachers, and a belief that upholding academic standards was racist, have led to a widespread <a href="https://www.educations.com/higher-education-news/grade-inflation-in-education-a-growing-concern-for-us-students" target="_blank">US grade inflation</a>.</p><p>The second problem is that any economy only has so much use for highly educated people. If you would add a million Ph.D. level&nbsp;astrophysicists to an economy, that wouldn\'t be of much help, as most of them would end up serving fries at McDonalds.</p><p>Consider all that when you read about the jobocalypse. There are a lot of half-truths in that reporting. Have some jobs been lost to AI? Probably, but far fewer than you think. A lot of tech companies have simply hired too many people during the pandemic, and instead of admitting that, they explain their hiring freeze with AI, as that sounds better to investors. The growing unemployment numbers of college graduates have only a little to do with AI, and a lot to do with there being too many college graduates for the economy, and their actual education being of lower quality than it used to be. If you consider the US higher education system purely as a business, it is obvious that maximum throughput at maximum tuition fees produces the highest profits. The quality of the education isn\'t of much concern: You can identify the few actually brilliant people and encourage them to a career in academia, while any lack of education of the rest becomes a problem for other industries.</p><p>While higher education systems in other countries all have their own problems, they are mostly still retaining a higher percentage of meritocratic elements, and fewer business consideration. The result is on paper fewer graduates, but in reality higher education standards, and an output of people that aligns closer with the needs of industry.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': '<p>When I write about economics on this blog, I frequently write about global phenomena, like the growth of inequality, or how housing has globally become unaffordable.

On paper, that makes the US highly educated: From <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/fig_2.png" target="_blank">1940 to 2021 the percentage of population age 25+</a> without a high-school degree dropped from 75.9% to 8.9%, while the percentage of people with a bachelor\'s degree or more rose from 4.6% to 37.9%.</p><p>There are only two problems with that: The first one is that people who graduate from college in 2025 are a lot less educated than those who graduated 50 years ago. Especially over the last few years,&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/" target="_blank">AI has literally made students dumber</a>.&nbsp;One in five employed American adults with a bachelor’s degree <a href="https://www.opencampus.org/2021/06/10/a-troubling-lack-of-skills-in-literacy-and-numeracy/" target="_blank">lacks important skills in literacy, with one in three falling below proficient levels in numeracy</a>. A weird mix of economic incentives for teachers, and a belief that upholding academic standards was racist, have led to a widespread <a href="https://www.educations.com/higher-education-news/grade-inflation-in-education-a-growing-concern-for-us-students" target="_blank">US grade inflation</a>.</p><p>The second problem is that any economy only has so much use for highly educated people. If you would add a million Ph.D. level&nbsp;astrophysicists to an economy, that wouldn\'t be of much help, as most of them would end up serving fries at McDonalds.</p><p>Consider all that when you read about the jobocalypse. There are a lot of half-truths in that reporting. Have some jobs been lost to AI? Probably, but far fewer than you think. A lot of tech companies have simply hired too many people during the pandemic, and instead of admitting that, they explain their hiring freeze with AI, as that sounds better to investors. The growing unemployment numbers of college graduates have only a little to do with AI, and a lot to do with there being too many college graduates for the economy, and their actual education being of lower quality than it used to be. If you consider the US higher education system purely as a business, it is obvious that maximum throughput at maximum tuition fees produces the highest profits. The quality of the education isn\'t of much concern: You can identify the few actually brilliant people and encourage them to a career in academia, while any lack of education of the rest becomes a problem for other industries.</p><p>While higher education systems in other countries all have their own problems, they are mostly still retaining a higher percentage of meritocratic elements, and fewer business consideration. The result is on paper fewer graduates, but in reality higher education standards, and an output of people that aligns closer with the needs of industry.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/5206067061090591794/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/5206067061090591794', 'title': '5 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5206067061090591794'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5206067061090591794'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/10/education-is-not-just-financial.html', 'title': 'Education is not just a financial transaction'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '5'}

Videogames are a bit different: People use other words, like complex, or "difficult to learn", to describe a game like Europa Universalis. But calling a videogame just "difficult" in the overwhelming majority of cases means only one thing: The game demanding a very fast reaction time, and you not being able to progress if you aren\'t fast enough.

If the difficulty of a game lies in its complexity, that is something that can be overcome by studying the game. But for reaction time, there is a hard cap, which is biological.

Older people have always had more money than younger people, because they had the time to accumulate wealth or experience that translates into higher salaries.

There are no official numbers, but estimates from various sources, based on various data collected by players about players.

Before the release of WoT 2.0, estimated player numbers were down to 2.5 million, and we don\'t have numbers yet how much the new version was able to revive.</div><div><br /></div><div>Declining player numbers not only pose a financial problem to Wargaming, the company running the game. It also poses a financial problem to a number of YouTube channels that have dedicated their channel to World of Tanks content. Fewer players means fewer potential viewers, which means less revenue from content creation. And of course the content creators each have their own idea why World of Tanks is declining, and frequently blame Wargaming for some decision or other. This is also somewhat typical for YouTube: If you run a channel for a game and don\'t frequently criticize the game, you will be seen as a shill. Also the occasional <i>"World of Tanks is dying"</i> sensationalist / controversial video is good for viewer numbers, as controversy gets more clicks than <i>"this is fine"</i> content.</div><div><br /></div><div>So while Wargaming was mostly concerned how to monetize the remaining players, many YouTube channels were complaining about that monetization. That went as far as some channels organizing a "boycott", in which they wouldn\'t review the tanks from loot boxes. Unsurprisingly, Wargaming wasn\'t amused, and removed content creator privileges from the YouTubers complaining the loudest. Which didn\'t make the content on YouTube about World of Tanks any more positive.</div><div><br /></div><div>World of Tanks has, and always had, a slower pace than other online shooters. Especially with heavier tanks at higher tiers and with players using terrain and cover well, a lot of shots simply didn\'t penetrate armor. Which kept tanks alive longer, and led to matches being up to 15 minutes long. Now on the one side, Wargaming felt that a faster game would attract more players. On the other side, Wargaming wanted to sell stuff to players, like premium tanks and premium ammunition. So over the years, power creep occurred: The tanks today penetrate armor a lot more often, due to players using premium "Pay2Win" features. In addition, one of the major changes in World of Tanks 2.0 is an "armor flashlight", that makes it easier for less experienced players to see where the armor of the enemy is weak and can be penetrated.</div><div><br /></div><div>Between that, and the drive to get players back, or new players into the game, veterans of World of Tanks aren\'t happy: Too many people in a typical battle aren\'t very experienced, and play in a more YOLO style, which has become more viable due to that power creep. Thus battles are now much faster, often last only around 5 minutes, and feel very different to the more careful style the veterans are used to. Thus an increasing number of World of Tank content creators are just ranting about the game these days, which doesn\'t really help to promote it, and contributes to the downward spiral. Which also reduces their own viewer numbers. A video 5 years ago from Quickybaby about the best starting tech tree got 692k views, while an equivalent video from 2 weeks ago about which free tech tree to pick only got 255k views. It is pretty obvious that the World of Tanks ecosystem is not in a good shape. The game company and the content creators all make a lot less money than a few years ago, and often blame each other for that.</div><div><br /></div><div>Undoubtedly related to declining player numbers and the resulting matchmaking problems is the fact that World of Tanks today has a lot more PvE parts than it had 5 years ago, when I played last. Today, unless you turn it off, your first battles every day are PvE battles against bots. And why would you turn that off, when you are more likely to win against bots than against real players, and you get full credits and xp for those wins, they just don\'t affect ranking. There are also a number of PvE events, and a badly defined "new player protection mode", in which new players are again more likely to face bots as enemies, or other newer players, and are protected from "seal clubbing", as the practice of veteran players farming new players for xp and credits was known.</div><div><br /></div><div>But while the increase of PvE actually makes World of Tanks more attractive to me, I don\'t think I will play WoT 2.0 a lot.

Fate is a board game by designer Matt Leacock. Matt got his breakthrough in the board game industry with Pandemic, and has since then made several board games that are variations of the Pandemic system. Z-Man Games even created a trademark for <a href="https://www.zmangames.com/universe/pandemic-system/" target="_blank">Pandemic System</a> games, and added some more games not designed by Matt. There are Pandemic System games with a World of Warcraft theme, a Fall of Rome theme, a Dutch dikes themes, a Cthulhu theme, and Star Wars theme, and now Fate joins them as a Pandemic System game with a The Lord of the Rings theme. So I wasn\'t too impressed on hearing this game being announced, it sounded a lot like yet another milking of the same old cash cow. Then I got to play the game at a board game night, and my attitude changed. I even rushed out to buy a copy.<div><br /></div><div>So, what is the Pandemic System? All games with this system are cooperative board games, where the players together struggle to hold back a growing threat. After every player move, some enemy cards are revealed that make bad things happen. If players aren\'t efficient enough to fight the threats faster than they appear, things go downhill quickly. As a special twist, at some points in the game the already played enemy cards are shuffled and put back on the <b>top</b> of the enemy deck. Which means that some enemy cards you\'ll see repeatedly, concentrating the threat locally, and others not at all.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fate adds a new twist to this system: The enemy (shadow) cards now have two different backs. When you turn over the top shadow card, the back of the next card tells you whether to apply the effect on the top or the bottom. Bottom effects put shadow troops (think orcs) into play, bottom effects move those troops in the direction of some haven. This makes the new system slightly more varied than the standard Pandemic System, and Fate just might be the best Pandemic game just from a pure game mechanics point of view.</div><div><br /></div><div>But the reason I would really recommend Fate as a board game is the theme. Which means that my recommendation is addressed to anybody who has at least a decent knowledge of The Lord of the Rings, either by having read the books, or by having seen the films, or ideally both. We played Fate once with a guy who had no clue who Gandalf was, and he still had fun, but there is a huge amount of additional fun to have if you are somewhat knowledgeable of Tolkien\'s work. On the one side, the growing threat produced by the improved Pandemic System is a perfect fit for the growing threat of Sauron in The Lord of the Rings. Also the group being split up all over the map of Middle Earth is an obvious fit to the story. On the other side of things, the game cleverly references the memorable scenes of the books / movies by turning them into quests. On my first game, I was playing Gandalf the Grey, and I had to go to Moria, confront the Balrog, and come back as Gandalf the White. There is a good selection of different quests for different characters, only Frodo having to throw the One Ring into Mount Doom is always the final quest to win the game. Playing Fate feels a lot like The Lord of the Rings, the theme is extremely well integrated into gameplay, and if you like the theme, it adds a lot to the fun of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship costs about $80, or slightly cheaper at €65 in Europe. That makes it a lot cheaper than many of the crowdfunded games I own, but still relatively expensive compared to other retail games. My main point of criticism of the game is that it includes a cardboard dice tower; that adds a lot to table presence, but it is somewhat fiddly to put together, and you have to partially disassemble it to put it back into the box. As you often only throw 3 dice or less, it seems like an unnecessary cost element to me, although some other people absolutely love that thing. I like that the characters are screen printed on wooden pieces instead of being plastic miniatures. The allied and shadow troops are a bit on the small side. But kudos to Asmodee, who without fuzz agreed to send me a replacement for a damaged dwarven troop in my copy of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>Personally I like the cooperative nature of Fate, and its variability. But there being no hidden information opens the game up to the risk of one alpha gamer trying to boss around everybody else at the table to do what he says. Fate needs cooperation, but one needs to balance that with the need for player agency. I guess it depends very much on your gaming group. A group that is working very well together can potentially play Fate at a higher player count of 4 or 5; for most groups 2 or 3 players is probably safer. Also a matter of personal preference is your acceptance of luck in a game. Random characters having to do random quests means that different games can be very different in difficulty; the random nature of the shadow cards can also produce spikes of difficulty, or just ruin your plans by a bad luck draw. On the positive side, this keeps Fate very interesting, you aren\'t going to get to a situation where you feel you have already won only half way through the game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'Winning the award for the board game with the most unwieldy title this year, I\'ll call&nbsp;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/436217/the-lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-fellowship" target="_blank">The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</a> just Fate for the rest of this post.

On the positive side, this keeps Fate very interesting, you aren\'t going to get to a situation where you feel you have already won only half way through the game.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/5484888468973093854/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/5484888468973093854', 'title': '0 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5484888468973093854'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/5484888468973093854'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-lord-of-rings-fate-of-fellowship.html', 'title': 'The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '0'}

They envision a future with elements from films like The Terminator, or A Space Odyssey, where AI becomes self-aware, super-intelligent, and intent on oppressing or wiping out humans. I don\'t think any of that will happen during my lifetime, armed robots simply aren\'t really a thing yet. In 2025 there is a possibility, albeit a small one, that you get killed by an AI-driven car. But we don\'t even have enough data, enough widespread adoption, and enough standardized AI driving technology that we could even say whether an AI driver kills more or less people than a human driver. The large language model generative AI from software like ChatGPT can kill people indirectly by causing mental harm, e.g. encouraging suicide, but that is still very far from a Terminator future.<div><br /></div><div>In the medium term, a much more realistic fear of AI is that of a disruption of the jobs market through artificial intelligence. The nature of work will change somewhat if companies move towards a wider adoption of AI. New jobs will emerge, but some old jobs will disappear. If you never heard anybody describing his job as "Vibe Coding Cleanup Specialist", that is because that job didn\'t exist before AI. Today it does, but the company hiring him is probably hiring fewer regular coders.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe there is a much bigger short term risk of AI, but I will have to precede my thoughts with a "this is not financial advice" disclaimer. Stock markets are at an all time high. The S&amp;P 500 is now over 40% tech stocks, and most of those tech stocks are heavily invested in artificial intelligence. There is at least a non-zero probability that there is an AI bubble, that investors overestimated the gains companies can make with AI over the coming years, and that the bubble could burst when these gains don\'t get realized as fast as they thought. How does that work?</div><div><br /></div><div>What one needs to understand is the concept of market capitalization, market cap for short. For example Nvidia has&nbsp;24.4 billion shares outstanding, and these shares today trade at $177.75. If you multiply these two numbers, you get the Nvidia market cap of $4.3 trillion. The problem with the concept is that this is imaginary money. It would be impossible to exchange 24.4 billion shares of Nvidia for $4.3 trillion in cash, because the act of selling Nvidia shares would make the share price drop. The same is true for every other share. As long as more people want to buy these shares than there are for sale, stock prices rise. As soon as people want to sell and cash in, stock prices drop. If you bought Nvidia shares on January 1st 2023 for under $15 and sell them now for $177, you made a huge profit. If you buy Nvidia shares for $177 now, and in a year the stock price dropped by half, you would lose money on selling.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fundamentally, stock prices are correlated to what investors think the future of a company will look like. Recently OpenAI made a deal with Oracle to invest $300 billion in AI data centers built by Oracle. This raised the stock price of Oracle, but also of Nvidia, where Oracle would buy the chips for those data centers. If everything in this deal happens as announced, Oracle and Nvidia are expected to have higher revenue, and thus their stock prices rose on an expectation of that. But the future is uncertain, and this optimistic expectation of the future might just be plain wrong. OpenAI is actually losing money every year, and the $300 billion would have to come from investors. And then there is the practical difficulty of buying and powering that many data centers in just a few years. Once Nvidia has made the chips, sold them to Oracle, and Oracle has built the data centers, OpenAI still needs to figure out how to turn that $300 billion investment into a profitable revenue stream. With AI adoption by non-tech companies apparently slowing down, all that future profit isn\'t obvious.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe that stock markets are failing to price in the unintended consequences of the AI boom. For example, a lot of Americans have noticed their electricity prices going up, especially in regions where data centers have been built. Electricity is a regionally traded commodity, and if a lot of new electricity consumers go live, supply doesn\'t go up as fast as demand, and prices generally rise. That is a problem for AI data center owners, but also of all other industry using electricity, and of regular households.</div><div><br /></div><div>Another "unintended" consequence of AI is more unemployment. Where do the stock markets think the profits from AI will ultimately come from? The most straightforward way for a general company to make money with AI is to replace people by it, paying less for an "AI worker" than for the person who did the same job before. But if everybody has "lower labor cost", it also means that a lot of people are unemployed or earn a lot less. And these people are the customers for the companies on the stock market. We already see companies like McDonalds struggling because many of their customers are lower income households, and can\'t afford fast food anymore. If you directly translate aggregate lower labor cost into aggregate lower consumer spending, the future for some companies on the stock market looks a lot less rosy. Those aren\'t necessarily the same companies, e.g. Oracle does very little business with low income households. But right now a glorious AI future, whether it will happen or not, has already been priced into the stock price of the companies that might gain from it, and not yet into the stock price of the companies that would be at the losing end of that deal. I don\'t see McDonalds replacing a lot of its staff by AI, as AI isn\'t yet very good at flipping burgers.</div><div><br /></div><div>Investor optimism leads to overpriced stocks.&nbsp;"Irrational exuberance" in the words of Alan Greenspan. The price to earnings ratio of Nvidia is over 50, that of Oracle over 75. The historical average P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is between 10 and 20.&nbsp;Current S&amp;P 500 PE Ratio is over 30. So the most short term risk from artificial intelligence is not some version of the Terminator, but what is politely called a "stock market correction", where investors realize that AI isn\'t going to pay out *that* fast, and stock prices drop a lot, because suddenly more people are trying to sell their overpriced AI shares than there are people wanting to buy them. And that also affects people who simply invested in ETFs, or who have money in a 401k pension plan. That is not to say that AI isn\'t a technology that will make money in the future, it just might take longer, or the profits will go to different companies than investors think today. Just like the dot com bubble burst, and the internet is doing fine, the AI bubble can burst while AI still has a bright future.

Especially games that don\'t just sell on artistic appeal, but on gameplay. We don\'t need to live in a world where half of the indie games are using pixel art. And I am sure that generative AI could also be used to turn interesting art from human artists into video game animations at much lower cost than today. I would rather see games competing on their merits on platforms like Steam without the gatekeeping of big budget artwork.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/6126267731058331676/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/6126267731058331676', 'title': '3 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6126267731058331676'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6126267731058331676'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-gatekeeping-of-big-budgets.html', 'title': 'The gatekeeping of big budgets'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '3'}

Not the chance to get struck by lightning, it is around that number, although it obviously depends a lot on where and how you live. A link between carrying a mobile phone and getting cancer has been discussed, but the chance to get cancer is higher than the chance to get struck by lightning, and the possible increase to that chance is so low as to be considered not scientifically proven. Right now, in the EU official classification, mobile phones are in the same category of increased cancer risk as pickles.

This week in the news is a possible link between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and the child being born with autism. In the United States the probability of a child being born with autism is estimated to be 1 in 36. That is certainly higher than a century ago, but it is unclear whether this is due to external factors like Tylenol, or simply to an increased awareness of autism. Now there are scientific studies that link Tylenol to autism, and there are scientific studies that show no such link. Just as there are scientific studies that link glyphosate to&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and there being scientific studies that show no such link.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The difference now being that these things have been politicised, and in the USA a Republican would be more likely to believe in the link between Tylenol and autism, while a Democrat would be more likely to believe in the link between glyphosate and&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It should be obvious that this isn\'t how probability or science works. But humans are notoriously bad with probabilities. And thus anything that science would consider to be an event of low probability can find its way into our belief systems. If you thought my example of a mobile phone getting you struck by lightning was ridiculous, how about the belief that it was your sins that would get you struck by lightning? That was pretty wide spread in humanity over many different cultures and religions. And our belief systems are evolving away from being religious to being political. Especially in two-party systems like the USA, party affiliation today has a stronger influence on what you believe to be true than your religious affiliation.</div><div><br /></div><div>For all questions of "does product X causes undesirable outcome Y", I would urge you to consider that whatever you read might be a result of political bias. You still should ask the relevant scientific question of how high the probability of undesirable outcome X is with and without product X. How strong or weak is the link? If the probability is relatively high to start with, and increases only by a small amount, how justified would it be to sue the producer of product X for damages? Although in a legal system where the probability of getting over 1 million dollars in a lawsuit is higher than the probability of winning 1 million dollars in the lottery, scientific proof is maybe the last thing you want.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'Imagine that your probability of getting struck by lightning is 1 in a million in a given year.

Just as there are scientific studies that link glyphosate to&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and there being scientific studies that show no such link.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The difference now being that these things have been politicised, and in the USA a Republican would be more likely to believe in the link between Tylenol and autism, while a Democrat would be more likely to believe in the link between glyphosate and&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It should be obvious that this isn\'t how probability or science works. But humans are notoriously bad with probabilities. And thus anything that science would consider to be an event of low probability can find its way into our belief systems. If you thought my example of a mobile phone getting you struck by lightning was ridiculous, how about the belief that it was your sins that would get you struck by lightning? That was pretty wide spread in humanity over many different cultures and religions. And our belief systems are evolving away from being religious to being political. Especially in two-party systems like the USA, party affiliation today has a stronger influence on what you believe to be true than your religious affiliation.</div><div><br /></div><div>For all questions of "does product X causes undesirable outcome Y", I would urge you to consider that whatever you read might be a result of political bias. You still should ask the relevant scientific question of how high the probability of undesirable outcome X is with and without product X. How strong or weak is the link? If the probability is relatively high to start with, and increases only by a small amount, how justified would it be to sue the producer of product X for damages? Although in a legal system where the probability of getting over 1 million dollars in a lawsuit is higher than the probability of winning 1 million dollars in the lottery, scientific proof is maybe the last thing you want.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/4166210046328438336/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/4166210046328438336', 'title': '6 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/4166210046328438336'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/4166210046328438336'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/science-probability-and-political-bias.html', 'title': 'Science, probability and political bias'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '6'}

Good enough, anyway, that I pre-ordered the third book for Kindle and wish that I&#8217;d waited a little longer before this particular spot of curiosity struck, as there is going to be a lot of waiting to see this series unfold!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Dan Willis&#8217; <em>Arcane Casebook</em> series to fill the gap. I&#8217;m through two of the five books in the bundle I bought already, and I can tell I&#8217;ll be getting the rest. It&#8217;s a bit of an interesting spin on the genre, too, being set in &#8216;Depression era&#8217; New York, but where magic of various forms has taken the place of certain aspects of technology developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m torn on having Goodreads count it as a single book though. It&#8217;s >1,800 pages for the five books, which is not out of the question but certainly on the longer end of my typical books, but each individual book is shorter than my typical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still- I think I&#8217;ll hit my 15 book target easily enough even counting it as just the one, so eh! :)</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-september-2025/">Time to Loot Journal: September 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com">Time to Loot</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-september-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2', 'post-id': '65691'}

I&#8217;m convinced the first cave-teenager to suffer a break-up took to banging rocks together in a rhythmically satisfying way, rather than talking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could absolutely have been that cave-teenager. Finding music that resonates with the soul, or at least the big feelings of the moment, is cathartic in a way almost nothing else can be. Even if it does take a bit of mental gymnastics to make every line fit your situation sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a>. You may&#8217;ve heard of it &#8212; but if not, it&#8217;s an AI that can create songs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d heard of it before. But honestly? I had simply assumed it&#8217;d be little more than a toy. Somewhere along the line I got the idea you had to provide your own vocals, and the AI just acted like a souped-up auto-tune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>can</em> use it like that, sure. But you can also simply write your own lyrics and have it go at it. Heck &#8212; if you&#8217;d rather, you don&#8217;t even need to do that. Just describe what you want, like any other LLM, and it&#8217;ll spit out your response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only this time it comes with a soundtrack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://suno.com/s/YfVE4FBgRpdZWnZF"><em>Shadows and Neon</em></a> is one such created in this way. I could not have expended any less effort on it if I <em>tried</em>. I can&#8217;t even recall what my prompt was, but I know I didn&#8217;t even bother prompting for specific styles. I just wasn&#8217;t invested yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it made me sit up and pay attention because I couldn&#8217;t hand on heart tell you I&#8217;d definitely have identified it as AI-generated if I hadn&#8217;t just clicked the &#8216;Create&#8217; button myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thus Starts my Crash Course in Song Construction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I <em>like</em> music, I couldn&#8217;t have told you a few days ago what a &#8216;prechorus&#8217; was (beyond the obvious), or what precisely a &#8216;bridge&#8217; is meant to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of this learning was just feeding in basic prompts and seeing what came out, but I also took a bit of a stab at seeing if I knew enough to take inspiration from other, much better, songs and seeing if Suno could get me anywhere close. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was even reading song and album reviews for crying out loud. It was a bit like learning a new language adjacent to, but not quite the same as the one you&#8217;re native to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/jJSVX5qAs2KcYbK6">What Never Relents</a></em> is one such attempt, where I was looking to see if I could craft a style prompt to hit a similar feel to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUe9UhcUtEI">Specter by Bad Omens</a></em>. It does tickle me that the generated lyrics here used &#8216;Specter&#8217; without specifically being prompted to or given the lyric directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not an unqualified success (particularly not on the vocal stylings), I was, once again, somewhat impressed. And I hadn&#8217;t even realised that you could enfold section-specific direction to vocals and music in the lyrics as well yet!<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-1-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-65184" title="I mean, it will ignore you completely 9 times out of 10, but still, you can!"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Toy to Therapist</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point, a switch flicked. Don’t ask me how or why &#8212; I couldn’t tell you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I do know is that I realised I’d still been treating Suno as a toy, when it was clearly more than that. So… I did something I haven’t done in <em>many</em> years.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-2-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65184" title="Probably not since I was that rock-bashing cave-teen myself."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote something like poetry — only this time, I had a way to give it a soundtrack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we call those songs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because she’d been on my mind a lot lately, I wrote one about my mother. Let me tell you &#8212; I was <em>not</em> ready to hear the words sung back at me. Jesus H. Christ. I&#8217;m uncertain what context to give. Perhaps none, and leave it to what I&#8217;ve already <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/goodbye-mum/">said in the past</a>. Songs are meant to speak for themselves anyway, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hit me harder than I expected. Harder than I was ready for. And yet, I kept working on it. It took a fair bit of finessing of lyrics and style guides to get where I wanted it &#8212; and Suno really does not like being told what to do if you introduce the concept of a second voice &#8212; but I ultimately found my way to this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/zQ6jTxGIw1ClJRnT">The Weight of Love</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s still a sombre piece overall, the more I tweaked, the more small notes of light started slipping in. Verse 3, for example, wasn’t in the first draft at all &#8212; it only emerged as I kept writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, for starters, I think I finally get why some albums feel like they’re circling one idea over and over. Apparently, when something matters, you don’t just&#8230; wring it out in a single track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So of course I had to do another. I had more work through here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just like that, I think I&#8217;m on the path to just creating a whole (virtual) album. Whodathunk? Certainly not me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not blind to the issues such AI technologies pose, whichever side of the fence you sit on. I can&#8217;t say I know how ethically the models have been trained (but&#8230; I could guess). Nor do I relish a future where the world is drowning in &#8216;AI Slop&#8217; in the music field as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the transition of considering Suno from Toy to Therapist is perhaps telling of my perspective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to spell it out; I don’t think anything I make with it should soar to the top of the charts, or replace the work of genuinely talented artists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as something personal — a way to process, to experiment, to speak feelings I’d struggle to put into words otherwise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s powerful stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first cave-teenager banged rocks together to make sense of big feelings. I guess I’m doing the same, only now the rocks have been swapped for an algorithm and a pair of headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bonus Track</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/hjZv4nd55jkbFif0">Remember Me (That Way)</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second (made, but maybe not in final placement) track from this hypothetical album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honouring Mum&#8217;s request for how she wished to be remembered &#8212; but without burying the truth for those left behind, either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a trickier one to land, asking Suno to balance minor and major sections to hit the right overall tone. Last night I was <em>just about</em> ready to come to the conclusion Suno simply couldn&#8217;t do it. After changing my approach to the in-lyric style notes and the main style guide, here we go!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/">Accidentally, Songs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com">Time to Loot</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'post-id': '65184'}

My interest has increased the further on I&#8217;ve gone though, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was to point out the key reason for enjoying this one less, it would be the tie-in to real-world, actual history.  I shant elaborate further as to what or when, but I will explain a little more my issue with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it isn&#8217;t the subject matter itself, nor the philosophical or ethical lean Lawrence is aiming for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m on board with all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it removed all subtlety from the proceedings. It no longer asked the reader to think through implications and parallels for themselves and instead became a mallet to the face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strength of fiction, done well, is that whole stimulation of thought. Creating (or perhaps more accurately, finding) the links for yourself. I believe it truly holds the power to change hearts and minds in a way that a raw recounting of history cannot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than that though, no-one enjoys being preached at, even when they already agree with the message. While I wouldn&#8217;t quite accuse Lawrence of that here with the third book, it started feeling like it might toe that line to begin with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all that &#8212; I&#8217;m still more than curious to see where the series ends, and it does little to dampen my enthusiasm for Lawrence as an author on the whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

Beyond that though the decision gets a fair bit trickier. Both FFXIV and Wuthering Waves are doing their darndest to be the one. Wuthering Waves had its 2.6 patch this week, with a character banner I was actually interested in<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-3-65003"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/wuthering-waves/screenshot-saturday-wuthering-waves-2-6-edition/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-65003" title="I haven&amp;#8217;t gone for anyone since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D9K2rz3Uvk&quot;&gt;Cartethyia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=optr9r9VkoQ&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;)"><sup>3</sup></a></span> and what looks to be a finale-feeling storyline for the Rinascita story arc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Although it is possible, actually, that this trailer is representing more than just 2.6. Perhaps a 2.7 is in our future to close out Rinascita. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know yet because I haven&#8217;t actually <em>started</em> the 2.6 Main Story Quest yet, let alone finished it. Actually- that&#8217;s not 100% true. I have done the preamble/character introduction bits, but then paused just shy of getting started <em>properly</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead I&#8217;ve caught up on the Overture quest from 2.5, which, come to think of it, is pretty similar in nature to the between-expansion quest lines of FFXIV. Just&#8230; <em>much</em> shorter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; Alright, I&#8217;ve gone on this long. I was going to outline the case for FFXIV before deciding, but perhaps that can just occupy next week&#8217;s slot! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-columns wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65007" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250828220450_2-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Won Augusta 1st night of the patch!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65008" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250830020819_1-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Did <em>not</em> win weapon first night.

The mindblowing nature of this fact is pretty intense. I realise this. I did warn you though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This truth wasn&#8217;t revealed to me in a dream, but rather while I was writing <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/final-fantasy-xiv/the-far-edge-of-fate/">yesterday&#8217;s post</a>. I was on a deadline, albeit a self-imposed one. I had things to do. &#8230; Thing to do. <em>Alright, geez,</em> I had a game to play. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have our own motivations, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonight I don&#8217;t have quite the same need. I made it through the end of Heavensward, hit credits (<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/final-fantasy-xiv/rolling-credits-on-heavensward/">again</a>), and got the Stormblood title drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-64967" height="529" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250827233112_1-940x529.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV:</em></strong> Passing the Wall, into all new lands.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, I lied, I do have the same need. I want to play more. The start of Stormblood is great so far. Plus! I now know who the lady in red in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt1h1MinlLI">Stormblood trailer</a> is! All these years, and I just assumed she was a class trainer from the expansion. Eesh!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. I&#8217;m getting distracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; If focus is the key, I might be in trouble. ! <em>Althooough</em>, I got distracted <em>while</em> writing this time. So I&#8217;m going to call that progress. Surely it&#8217;s better than stopping mid-post to reply in Discord or Google some random thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I think it might be actually, is channelling that&#8230; <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/writing-comments-vs-posts/">comment writing energy</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The linked post goes into more detail, but as a brief recap if you haven&#8217;t the foggiest what I mean&#8230; Something that&#8217;s true for me, and others, and maybe you&#8217;ll recognise it as well after I explain it, is that writing a post&#8230; Man, that&#8217;s <em>work</em>. It takes time. Serious time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments though? Even if they end up being post-length in nature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Easy</em>. They just flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a whole other part of your brain gets engaged. Or&#8230; Perhaps more accurate to say that in &#8216;comment&#8217; writing, a part of your brain <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> get engaged. Namely, the critic. The editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All to say, I found Wilhelm&#8217;s post today both incredibly timely, <em>and</em> incredibly enlightening, <em>and</em> amusing to boot.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>Basically, the secret to my success is low standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8211; Wilhelm Arcturis (2025), <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/08/27/blaugust-motivation-where-do-all-these-words-come-from/">Blaugust Motivation – Where Do All These Words Come&nbsp;From?</a> (The Ancient Gaming Noob)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And I should also add: accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should take the time to read the post yourself, so I don&#8217;t want to give it all away &#8212; but one last part I can&#8217;t help but to voice agreement with. I have the time to blog more. Write more. It is absolutely a choice to prioritise other pursuits (*cough* games) more often than not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps if I consciously leaned into this style more often, I could have my cake and eat it too&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;Thoughts for another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Games await.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Full List of Blaugust 2025 Participants</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/blaugust-2025-is-here/">little while</a> since I posted the list of Blaugust participants.

And if you look at it funny and kinda squint a little bit, you might stretch me to two and a quarter. Maybe even two and a half &#8212; as the missing game I <em>had</em> played before, at its PlayStation release. I just thought I might pick it up again on PC, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong> is, frankly, amazing. The gameplay trailers we saw in the four years of development often seemed as if coming directly from a game designer&#8217;s fever dream. Such doubts didn&#8217;t stop me in the slightest from feeling an unhealthy degree of hype for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-medium is-resized wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-58475" height="264" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blackmyth-Wukong-470x264.jpg" style="width: 400px;" width="470" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I knew what I was doing, and it was certainly at the back of my mind that it could <em>never</em>.

Turns out, there <em>was</em> a reason my friends and I have played through all three Borderlands games to date, sometimes multiple times! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was with that lens some of the gameplay coming out from content creators grabbed my attention a bunch more, and here we are, considering prioritising it against even Hollow Knight: Silksong!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Battlefield 6 &#8212; 11 October</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/other-games/battlefield-6-open-beta/">The beta</a> was enough to convince my friend group that we want in. It was a <em>blast</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been a while since we have all done a Battlefield game together. We had some interest in 2042 (in fact&#8230; it made an appearance in the <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/gaming/coming-games-of-interest-2021-edition/">Games of Coming Interest &#8212; 2021 Edition</a>), but, uh&#8230; That one didn&#8217;t end up being so good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This seems a real return to form, with destruction on par with what my memories tells me Bad Company 2 had. (And no, I&#8217;m not interested in going back and proving myself wrong or removing my nostalgia goggles. It&#8217;s my favourite!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; This is the second game on the list that has some dependence on Borderlands 4; namely &#8212; are we done with it by the time this rolls around?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If not, perhaps it awaits a sale, or at least the Christmas break.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where Winds Meeting &#8212; 15 November</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell you what game <em>isn&#8217;t</em> dependent on Borderlands 4 though &#8212; it&#8217;s this one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has actually been on my radar for at least a couple of years, I think the Arekkz channel first introduced me to it. What I didn&#8217;t appreciate until quite recently is that it isn&#8217;t just a Singleplayer game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is there co-op, but you can even (optionally) go into a full &#8216;Online&#8217; mode where it is more of an MMO-lite, with world events/bosses, and the whole nine yards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh- it&#8217;s also free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which can be boon or bane; but at least how the devs are talking now &#8212; the monetisation seems restricted to cosmetics only. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a slew of sponsored videos like this one, where there is clearly a desire to build interest in the West before the release later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is coming across as a bit of an &#8216;everything to everyone&#8217; game at the moment, which again&#8230; Could be concerning. But the responses so far seem, on the whole, quite positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So bring on my SP/Co-Op/MMO Wuxia Souls-Like Action Combat Life Sim game! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Borderlands 4 and Where Winds Meet are the two definites on this list. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There isn&#8217;t a world in which those two get missed. Although if I had been forced to choose between the two&#8230; I think it would be Borderlands 4 that got the boot, honestly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other two are trickier to call. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I would say that I reckon even should Hollow Knight: Silksong ride the deferral bus for a bit, I&#8217;m much more likely to circle back to it. Battlefield 6 on the other hand, if we let that one slide now&#8230; Eh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe we pick it up on a sale somewhere down the line?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guess we&#8217;ll see when the next one of these comes around!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

I had already gone far enough last time to be into the 3.3 content, and end the major conflict of the expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I returned, I was on the MSQ (Main Story Quest) titled &#8216;Choices&#8217;, which had a bit of &#8216;Anime Beach Day&#8217; energy to it, albeit with far less fan service. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-64854" height="529" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250823225638_1-940x529.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mission was to bring the various city-states together in a Grand Melee, as a sign of breaking Ishgard out of its previously insular footing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was actually fairly impressed that the melee itself had some systems attached. Simple ones, sure &#8212; but more than I expected. The winner is first to 100 points, where any regular soldier is worth just 1 point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, each side will always have one fighter marked by a beam, indicating they are worth 10. You need to take down their big point targets while protecting your own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And</em>, the whole thing culminates in a boss battle which I shan&#8217;t spoil, although I do I have to admit&#8230; *cough* &#8230;it took me a few tries. Because I <em>thought</em> it was a simple DPS race (I was <em>very</em> close to achieving it this way), but I was underestimating the game again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a mechanic there which needed to be respected. Again, not complex, nothing you wouldn&#8217;t have seen before even within FFXIV up until that point.

Cyberpunk 2077, for all its launch faults, is in fine form now. It wasn&#8217;t abandoned or given bare minimum technical touch-ups. Instead, it had literal <em>years</em> of additional development effort put in to make it sing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bring it up in the context of a brilliant post by <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/">Frostilyte</a>, asking the question: &#8220;<a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/18/is-it-wrong-to-support-grounded-2-in-early-access/">Should <em>Grounded 2</em> even be <em>allowed</em> to utilise <em>Early Access</em>?</a>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My title probably spoils this, but: <em><strong>yes</strong></em>. Not only <em>should</em> Grounded 2 be &#8216;allowed,&#8217; I wish more big titles had the guts to wear the Early Access label when it fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyberpunk sure should have. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, gamers were left feeling anything &#8212; or everything &#8212; from frustration to disappointment, or even betrayal. Slap the EA badge on it and suddenly? The consumer transparency preserves a mountain of goodwill and space to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281" height="461" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190826000049_1-830x461.jpg" width="830" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>No Man&#8217;s Sky</em></strong>: Another example where the &#8216;Early Access&#8217; tag really should&#8217;ve been applied.

Although I would hope not a controversial one: <em>If, for whatever reason, you&#8217;re not going to finish the game before putting it out, maybe at least be honest about this fact.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Frostilyte had more than just us consumers in mind. He was interested in watching out for the Indies, and that&#8217;s where the debate perhaps gets a little more complicated. Early Access was, after all, born as an indie lifeline — a way to keep the lights on and build community while development continued. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It provided a path that maybe <em>didn&#8217;t</em> ask Indies to re-mortgage their house in trade for a year of development time in the hopes of not (literally) losing it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when AAA shows up in that space, the worry is whether it tilts the field even further against the smallest studios. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-53598" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CS2Header-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Cities: Skylines 2:</em></strong> Even now, this one should still be wearing an Early Access badge.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And from that concern, there are a couple of additional paths beyond consumer transparency that my mind goes down, but neither of them changes my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>Indies and AAA <em>already</em> co-exist; and Indies aren&#8217;t just catering to a small niche of interest any more.</strong><br />Indies and AAA&#8217;s already co-exist in the market today, having broadened from a once scrappy niche with only occasional breakouts to something with a higher degree of awareness in the gaming zeitgeist. AAA&#8217;s adopting &#8216;Early Access&#8217; doesn&#8217;t materially change things for the worse, and in fact, there is an argument to be made that says such a move would further legitimise &#8216;Early Access&#8217; and broaden the range of people willing to try it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>What even is an &#8216;Indie&#8217; anyway?</strong><br />The term covers a vast spectrum, from the solo dev mortgaging their house we mentioned, to &#8216;indie elites&#8217; like Supergiant, Team Cherry, or Larian, pulling in millions with sizable teams. Depending on how you define it, even CD Projekt Red might qualify as indie, given they self-publish.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-8-64743"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-shouldve-launched-in-early-access/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-64743" title="Albeit with an employee count in the 4-digit range."><sup>8</sup></a></span> The gulf between struggling solos and elite indies is at least as significant as the gap between elite indies and AAA, which makes drawing the exclusion line at AAA feel arbitrary.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-47980" height="264" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20221221014306_1-940x264.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide:</em></strong> Yep, you guessed it.

Although this thing has been in the works so long, it certainly has been placed &#8212; for the purposes of retaining sanity &#8212; in my mind into the category of &#8216;never going to turn up in my natural lifespan&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do think a shadow drop at the end of this is not out of the question, but at minimum, I expect we&#8217;ll come away with a release date to go alongside the additional gameplay teaser.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lords of the Fallen II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve only somewhat recently started playing Lords of the Fallen (2023) after their 2.0 update, when they added in co-op by way of a free &#8216;Friends Pass&#8217;, which is a neat addition I always love to see for any game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re not done with it yet, hard to say if we even will (my co-op partner is not much of a Souls-like afficiando), but the experience while not a top-notch-shining-example of the genre was good enough that I&#8217;m holding some interest in seeing where they go next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Europa Universalis V</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not given the Europa Universalis series anywhere near as much time as Crusader Kings, and in fact &#8212; EUIV is the only one I&#8217;ve touched at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is just something about the more personal relationships and stories of CK that pulls it ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so &#8212; colour me interested. Getting in at the ground floor on a Paradox game is generally a good idea if you want to have any hope of learning the game in question without reliance on extensive &#8216;let&#8217;s play&#8217; styled tutorial videos. xD</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Silent Hill <em>f</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230; <em>think</em>&#8230; I&#8217;m interested? I&#8217;ve actually never played a silent hill game before. The concept has always interested me (insofar as I understand it, at least) &#8212; just never made the jump to actually doing anything about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I watched the movie though, if that counts? xD</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, similar to EUV above &#8212; I&#8217;ll await reviews and see how it lands before deciding, but will keep it on my radar in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enshrouded &#8212; Wake of the Water Update</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick search tells me that the only prior mention of Enshrouded on Time to Loot was the <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-january-2024/">January 2024 Journal</a>. Said mention? Just a sole entry logging ~5 hours of play time, and that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll say now what I didn&#8217;t say then: I <em>loved</em> almost everything about my time with Enshrouded, even at that early point (which must&#8217;ve basically been at release).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was just one disappointing factor for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In multiplayer, the quest state is (was? I should look into this) determined by the world state. And not just for things where maybe it makes sense (e.g., rescuing an NPC) but for <em>everything</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you, as I do, prefer to have independent bases *in addition* to the more communal setup&#8211; so far as the quests are concerned anyway, too bad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is absolutely a nitpick, and even if that is unchanged, the look of this update, let alone whatever may have come up to this point, might be the point at which I let it go and jump back in regardless. It looks <em>great</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resident Evil Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My &#8216;real&#8217; introduction to Resident Evil (*cough* outside of the movies) was with what I believe to be the first of the modern entries &#8212; Resident Evil VII: Biohazard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still need to make my way through the frankly amazing-looking remakes at some point, but they may have to wait a bit longer after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Black Myth: Zhong Kui</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yes</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Myth: Wukong, somewhat amazingly, <em>actually managed to live up to the hype.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhong Kui isn&#8217;t just a DLC as earlier speculation suggested, but rather a full-on sequel. I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb and suggest there probably won&#8217;t be as long of a wait this time around, assuming a lot of technology (and perhaps even asset) re-use from Wukong.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vampire: the Masquerade -Bloodlines 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno about this one anymore. It has been through an incredible amount of development hell and studio handovers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might still come out of the oven OK, but I&#8217;d place the chances of that being <em>very</em> slight. Which is a shame, as this occupied the #1 spot on my Steam wishlist for probably a good few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess I might be listing it here now more out of morbid curiosity than anything else. It&#8217;s coming out October 22, 2025 &#8212; so I guess we&#8217;ll know soon enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63637 size-full" height="364" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/blaugust2025tpbk2.webp" width="900" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">\n<p>This was posted during\xa0<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/blaugust-2025-is-coming/">Blaugust 2025</a>, the annual blogging event normally hosted by\xa0<a href="https://aggronaut.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Belghast</a>, with a twist this year of being hosted by <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/">Krikket</a>.

The story is told in flashback, with a framing story of an interrogation of protagonist Amelia to explain the events that transpired.</p>\n<p>Those events have Amelia heading home after studies in a self-driving car after having a call with her boyfriend about a new D&amp;D campaign he is writing; perhaps the ending will be enough to get Amelia\'s online best friend Iris to visit. The night takes a turn for the worse for Amelia, as the car takes her far from Paris, to her childhood home of Haven, a castle on the Brittany coast.</p>\n<p>And there, Iris assures her (via a swiftly disappeared phone), Amelia will play a game. Guaranteed she will not get hurt, and she can leave anytime she likes, but she probably should just play.</p>\n<p>The <em>plot</em>\xa0deals with Amelia finding out some uncomfortable truths about her family and their long history. The <em>mechanism</em>\xa0is through tactical RPG battles. The <em>conceit</em>\xa0is that all the enemies she faces act according to strict rules from which they do not deviate. The <em>twist</em>\xa0is that you don\'t know what those rules are until you defeat an enemy type at least once. (A little bit of scribble on a whiteboard spoils the first enemy\'s).</p>\n<p>The demo consists of, as far as I can tell, two regular battles, a boss battle, and two challenge battles. You can rest, but doing so resets all battles (aside from boss battles) and locks all unlocked doors. You\'ll likely need to rest to replenish a resource called <em>plasma</em>\xa0which protects you in battles &#8212; the battle instantly ends when you take enough plasma damage. You\'ll need that plasma, not only to protect yourself, but to 3D print your fighters. The first couple are free; more costs plasma. (It is possible to earn more maximum plasma as you continue through the game).</p>\n<p>You get the template for your first fighter for free (rogue-type). You meet the second one (archer-type) in a robot bar (yes). You meet the <em>third</em>\xa0one (tank-type) in a cell, but I don\'t believe it is possible to recruit him in the demo. He wants you to kill a specific boss, but the one boss in the demo was not that one.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to this one.</p>\n<p>I should have put this post on the other blog.

Shortly after entering the City of Tears for the first time, you’re greeted by Hornet. She’s a recurring boss fight character, but this time she’s here with information instead of a challenge. We’re told that we need to seek a Grave of Ash, and then she takes off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The grave in question is a large monument located within the Resting Grounds, and is a required pit stop for players along the main quest of <em>Hollow Knight</em>. Despite this, no additional direction is provided by Hornet, nor is the location of the grave marked on your map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, <em>Hollow Knight’s</em> developer, <em>Team Cherry</em>, provided 4 different access points to the Resting Grounds for players to stumble upon. If you’re curious, the 4 paths are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>A tram from Forgotten Crossroads if the player has found the Tram Pass in Deepnest</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A path through Blue Lake if players have acquired the Crystal Heart</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A (seemingly) bottomless pit which you can accidentally fall down while exploring the Crystal Peaks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>An elevator located on the East side of the City of Tears that allows you to approach the graveyard from below</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Map from Hollow Knight showing the 4 entry points into the Resting Grounds." class="wp-image-9648" height="346" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/resting-grounds-from-hollow-knight_edit.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>By providing 4 different entry points into the Resting Grounds, <em>Team Cherry</em> has dramatically increased the odds for players to find this essential part of the game. As such, they don’t need to explicitly spell out where to go next. Instead, players are free to explore, and stumble into the Resting Grounds of their own accord.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This whole sequence &#8211; a vague hint resulting in the discovery of the Resting Grounds &#8211; was the key to what made <em>Hollow Knight’s</em> exploration tick. <em>Team Cherry</em> trusted that I’d get where I needed to go, so I was able to explore as I deemed fit. That made my whole journey feel like an adventure even though I was doing, and going exactly where the developers intended at every step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t just the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> that encourages this type of organic exploration: the sequel <em>Silksong </em>does too. For example, after clearing the tutorial, we come across a dilapidated settlement called Bone Bottom. Here we’re informed that we’ll need to make a pilgrimage to the holy city, the Citadel, which sits at the apex of Pharloom. From there, we’re left to find our way up the mountain, and discover the entrance to the Citadel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh. My mistake. It appears <em>Silksong </em>has actually marked the location of the Citadel on the map. That’s&#8230;a little disappointing. Though, I suppose that does clearly articulate where the game wants us to go, while also showing how much progress we’ve made towards our destination.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Map of Pharloom from the beginning of Hollow Knight: Silksong." class="wp-image-9651" height="346" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/map-at-beginning-of-game.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>That’s not really an example of organic exploration though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How about after we enter the Citadel, and encounter Lace for the second time. She fulfills a role similar to Hornet from the first game, and informs us that we need to ascend to the top of the Citadel to find, and defeat the God who cursed the entire kingdom of Pharloom.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Map of the Citadel shortly after meeting with Lace." class="wp-image-9653" height="346" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/map-within-citadel.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Oh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again with the quest marker showing exactly where we need to go next. That’s a little frustrating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fairness, Lace did give us fairly explicit instructions for where we ought to go next. That’s a stark contrast from the previous game where Hornet shouted about a grave, and took off without providing any context. On that basis, I suppose it isn’t that egregious to mark where we’re headed next on the map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re 0 for 2 here, but I promise that I’ve got the perfect example this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reaching the peak of the Citadel, we’re greeted by a locked lift. We’re then informed that in order to unlock the lift, we’ll need to search around the Citadel for 3 ancient melodies &#8211; 1 for each of the major factions within the holy city. Once we’ve collected all 3, the way forward will finally open, and we can break the curse that has beset Pharloom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect! I bet this’ll be when Team Cherry finally relinquishes the responsibility of exploration. It’ll be just like how finding the Resting Grounds was left entirely up to the player without any explicit guidance, or quest markers to get in the way of organic exploration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right?</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Map of the Citadel after defeating the Cogwork Dancers, and being assigned the quest to find the 3 songs of the Citadel." class="wp-image-9655" height="346" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/map-after-cogwork-dancers.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this juncture, there’s no point in pretending anymore: there is no moment in <em>Silksong </em>that’s akin to discovering the Resting Grounds. The game is way too afraid of letting players become lost for that to happen. As such, clear directions are provided at every step of the journey alongside quest markers that spoil the fun of actually discovering anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The single exception to this level of hand holding is the hidden trigger for Act 3. As such, many players will finish <em>Silksong </em>without fighting a third of its bosses, nor seeing its true ending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t get it twisted though: once you’ve started Act 3, the quest markers return in full force. It doesn’t matter that this part of the game is obviously intended for the most dedicated players looking for an additional challenge. Nope. You’re never going to get a chance to flex those navigation chops whatsoever, nor will you be expected to explore the remainder of Pharloom organically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a brief aside, I think it’s also worth mentioning that <em>Silksong </em>provides this same level of guidance within its various side quests too. A perfect example of this can be seen with courier quests where players make deliveries to named NPCs throughout Pharloom. The quest giver lets players know exactly where they’re meant to go, and the delivery only becomes available after they’ve met the recipient. Regardless, a quest marker is still slapped onto the map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also realize that I’m (probably) going to sound like an asshole for complaining about the increased volume of guidance in <em>Silksong</em>. There are several people that I’ve spoken to over the years who bounced off <em>Hollow Knight</em> because of how directionless it felt. Having quest markers to clearly define where players are expected to go completely sidesteps this problem, which is a huge boon for anyone who couldn’t get into the original game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me though, I can’t help but feel like something was lost in translation going from <em>Hollow Knight</em> to <em>Silksong</em>. The sequel doubles down on challenging platforming with areas like Bilewater and Mount Fay, while introducing several bosses like Karmelita, Trobbio, and Last Judge which meet or eclipse the difficulty of <em>Hollow Knight’s</em> most infamous fights. By comparison, I’ve felt starved for the quiet exploration that made the original such an enjoyable experience. That lack of direction made <em>Hollow Knight</em> unique in a way few games dare to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all that, I’m left asking the question: is it wrong of me to want less guidance in <em>Silksong</em>? Perhaps. There’s a not insignificant chance that these changes have made <em>Silksong </em>far more accessible to a wider range of players when compared to the original game. That’s gotta count for something, even if these changes are a massive turn off for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I don’t really want <em>Silksong</em>, or games like it, to be made exclusively for rat-brained people like myself. Rather, I’d appreciate an option to disable quest markers, and explore as I see fit. Just give me a chance to actually breathe in Pharloom, and explore at my own pace instead of whisking me through a guided tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

Most of your playtime will be spent looking for clues, or interviewing the various guests of the titular manor. Once enough information is uncovered, the game will prompt the player to make a deduction, which involves filling in the blanks of a sentence with colour-coded words, and phrases. It should all look very familiar to anyone who has played either of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2024/11/30/devilish-deduction-the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review/">The Golden Idol</a></em> games, and is just as satisfying here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, for my money, the reason to put <em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em> on your radar is the spooky flourishes. There’s some grade A sound design on display in the demo, and there were a couple of moments where the occasional flash of an otherworldly creature caused me to lurch in my chair. I don’t know that any of these were jump scares per se, and they tied in nicely with the supernatural themes and spooky atmosphere of the game, so I’d call it all fairplay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other notable difference for <em>Blake Manor</em> from its contemporaries is the inclusion of a timer. Every interaction costs 1 minute, which limits the number of items that a player can reasonably interact with while solving particular quandaries throughout their journey. As such, players need to think carefully about what they do, and don’t interact with, which I thought was a refreshing twist over indiscriminately interacting with everything. Though, I actually enjoy the added tension of a good timer, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, <em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em> is definitely 1 to keep your eyes on if you’re into Detective games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="moonsigil-atlas">Moonsigil Atlas</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A Deckbuilder where your cards cost physical space on the game board to play instead of energy/mana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3284290/Moonsigil_Atlas/">Moonsigil Atlas</a></em> was 1 of 3 different demos that I had to pull myself away from early, so that I could continue playing the other demos that I had downloaded. If that doesn’t speak volumes about how fun it is, then I don’t know what does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the basic idea here is that every card has a sigil inscribed onto it. You’re then able to play said card as long as you can find room for it on your game board. At the end of each turn, your board is cleared, and you draw a new hand. In this way, <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> replaces a typical energy system with the ability for players to continue playing cards as long as they can find, or make space for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s really neat about this system is how it influences the rest of the game’s design, which is why <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> felt so fresh to play. For example, effects that create new cards require players to plan ahead so that they actually have the available space to play said cards. Likewise, any card with the Persist keyword will remain on the board, which also requires a bit of foresight so that you don’t end up inadvertently screwing yourself on a future turn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upgrade system is also affected by this design, and allows players to alter the shape of a card’s sigil in addition to augmenting its effects when played. Heck, there’s even an upgrade that allows you to swap the sigils of 2 cards, which can be useful for giving a powerful card a much smaller shape that’s easier to play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, you’ll also have to consider a card’s shape in addition to its effect before drafting it. Consideration for a card’s energy cost is also present in traditional Deckbuilders, but the higher degree of shape customization means that <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> has more granularity for what will, and won’t work well within a given deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s just so many interesting things that cascade throughout <em>Moonsigil Atlas</em> because of this single foundation change. It feels like something I haven’t played before, and that’s always a welcome sight with Deckbuilders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-heavy-morning">A Heavy Morning</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>An interactive story about coping with depression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>I think it’s a really powerful feeling when you see yourself represented in a piece of media. It’s almost like you’re being acknowledged &#8211; like someone out there has seen you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, it can be a reminder that others have gone through similar experiences as you. That can be a really comforting sensation, especially while you’re actively working through those same experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say all of this as someone who has been attending therapy for depressive symptoms for over a year now. And it was really comforting to see some of my experiences represented so earnestly within <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3509400/A_Heavy_Morning/">A Heavy Morning’s</a></em> demo. It was a reminder that I’m not alone because of the authenticity, and sincerity with which the subject matter was presented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also liked how cognitive reframing, and box breathing were represented. Obviously, a video game isn’t going to fully capture the experience of using different cognitive behavioural therapy techniques to deal with depression, but I thought that <em>A Heavy Morning</em> did a faithful job of recreating both as interactive mini-games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably won’t be for everyone, but I’m glad that <em>A Heavy Morning</em> exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="monsters-are-coming">Monsters are Coming!

Instead of plopping your towers down from on high, you’d be right in the thick of it collecting resources, and defending your mobile fortress-city while fortifying its defences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I didn’t expect was that all of the actions performed by the player character would happen automatically. This puts Monsters are Coming inline with the deluge of other would-be successors to <em>Vampire Survivor’s</em> crown over the Bullet Heaven subgenre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, I thought <em>Monsters are Coming</em> was really damn compelling, and I had to tear myself away from it. There’s so much going on between collecting resources for your town, to actually building up your fortress’ economy, and defences. This meant that I was constantly bouncing around the screen trying to do something in service of the overarching goal of surviving the oncoming hordes. The result was a game that I found really compelling to play on a moment-to-moment basis, and the screen wasn’t a complete stimulus overload either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you, like myself, have found that Bullet Heaven games aren’t quite your cup of tea, then give <em>Monsters are Coming</em> a looksie. You might be pleasantly surprised like I was after finishing a few runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tearscape">Tearscape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>What if <em>Bloodborne </em>was 2D, and available on the <em>Gameboy Color</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>I’m not sure what <em>Bloodborne </em>did to everyone who played it, but I’m more than happy to keep trying games that are inspired by it. Doubly so if those games abandon the third dimension, and slap on a pleasantly nostalgic <em>Gameboy Color</em> aesthetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite that earlier comparison, the focus in <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3216340/Tearscape/">Tearscape</a> </em>isn’t exclusively on combat: it’s also a little puzzley. Though I wouldn’t say it’s puzzley in a traditional sense. Rather, <em>Tearscape </em>is puzzley in the same way that older games tended to be.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a quick example of what I mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While roaming around the graveyard at the start of the demo, I saw a locked chest off in the distance. I couldn’t get to said chest because it was behind a locked gate. I did however notice that there were some stairs next to the chest, so my assumption was that there must be an underground path that I’d missed. This was proven true a few screens over when I discovered the entrance to said tunnel hidden among a couple tombstones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that this sort of thing won’t be to everyone’s taste, but I felt really smart for identifying, and actually finding my way over to that chest. The contents of the chest weren’t even that substantive &#8211; the real reward was the dopamine hit from solving the puzzle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That aside, <em>Tearscape’s </em>combat was simple, but satisfying. It almost felt like 2D <em>Zelda </em>(which I believe is intentional), though the addition of a dodge roll, and parry do add a bit of necessary spice to the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re at all like me &#8211; easily won over by a game with a nostalgic artstyle, and some modern QoL tweaks &#8211; then <em>Tearscape </em>is something you should put on your radar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dead-weight">Dead Weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>Grid-based Tactics with sky pirates, defenestration, and a Roguelike twist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>You know what’s great? Defenestration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeatedly knocking people out of windows was part of what made last year’s <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2024/11/26/lets-get-tactical-tactical-breach-wizards-review/">Tactical Breach Wizards</a></em> such a joy to play. It almost feels like you’re cheating because you’ve effectively 1-shot an enemy, but done it in a way that doesn’t seem like it should be allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mention all of this because that same principle was adopted by <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2646720/Dead_Weight/">Dead Weight</a></em>. It’s a grid-based Tactics game where every character has a push action, and you can leverage that to send enemies to their untimely demise instead of doing things the old fashioned way. And I’m very much in the market for another game all about shoving people to death given that <em>TBW </em>was my favourite game from last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, it should be said that you can still do things the old fashioned way. In fact, leveraging a mix of both standard combat abilities, and defenestration proved vital in completing the tutorial run that was showcased by <em>Dead Weight’s</em> demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I still have some questions about how much run-to-run variance there will actually be in <em>Dead Weight</em>, I enjoyed what I played enough to throw it on my wishlist. The cadence of combat, and focus on positioning (for both offence, and defence) made for a strong impression, as did the excellent pixel art.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="whiskerwood">Whiskerwood</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A City Builder with <em>Redwall </em>vibes where you manage a village of anthropomorphic mice, and pay taxes to your cat overlords.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Gosh. Where do I even start with <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/">Whiskerwood</a></em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose I can start with the game’s visual appeal. I feel like I don’t need to explain that one too much. The folks at <em>Minakata Dynamics</em> could have used any muridae, but Mice do make for a particularly cute group of settlers. Plus, the different building designs are chock full of rustic appeal. I see enough glass, steel, and concrete in my day-to-day to where that’s a huge plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not all aesthetics that <em>Whiskerwood </em>has going for it though &#8211; the management side of things isn’t too shabby either. Right from the get go, you’re given taxes from the royal kingdom of cats that you’ll need to figure out how to pay. They send someone around to collect payments once every 3 days, so keeping on top of your economic exports is imperative to success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this isn’t too different from the kinds of drains that you’d find in other City Builders, I appreciate how it can be filled by whatever resources a player has on hand. Ore like copper, and gold go for the highest price, but if you’d like to save some of your reserves for later payments then you can opt to fill the remainder of your tax quota with excess lumber, fish, or thatch. It’s a nice addition that makes managing your economy in <em>Whiskerwood </em>feel a little less singularly focused on prospecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that I really liked about the <em>Whiskerwood </em>demo was how your mining activities terraform the playspace. I don’t know exactly how to articulate it, but it gives the world a sense of physicality, and place that other City Builders lack. I’d also hazard a guess that in longer playthroughs than my (limited) time with the demo, the constant erasure of space (thanks to continued mining) will lead to some interesting logistical problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="barrel-roll">Barrel Roll</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A Western themed Deckbuilder where your deck consists of the bullets in your revolver. Also, there are robots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts:&nbsp; </strong>I don’t think it’s a secret that I enjoy Roguelike Deckbuilders. I’ve been writing this blog for almost a decade now, and a new card game has made it onto my “best of” year-end list just about every single year. Heck, last year there were 2, and I have it on good authority that there’ll be another 2 Deckbuilders claiming top 10 spots for 2025 as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s all a really long way of saying that I’m keen to find, and play new takes on the genre. So you can imagine my excitement when I watched the Steam trailer for <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3860590/Barrel_Roll/">Barrel Roll</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it might not be a Deckbuilder in a wholly traditional sense, <em>Barrel Roll</em> has all the typical trappings that I look for from the genre. You’re drafting abilities, you have limited access to said abilities, and it takes careful planning and forethought to properly execute your strategy. It just so happens that you’re shooting your cards out of a revolver because they’re bullet-shaped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing that really set <em>Barrel Roll</em> apart for me though was how players are expected to manage their resources. You can only shoot each of your bullets once before you need to reload, and you’re limited to the next 3 bullets in the revolver when choosing your next shot. This makes the process of actually navigating your shots, and choosing when to reload a big part of your overarching strategy, which I really enjoyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The visuals, and music were also killer. I mean…just look at it. The use of cell-shading really works wonders here for giving <em>Barrel Roll</em> a striking appearance to set itself apart from other games. And the twangy Western sounds alongside a classic rock guitar riff for the main battle theme was chef’s kiss.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="xanthiom-2">Xanthiom 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A Metroidvania with open-ended exploration where you customize your weapon on the fly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts:\xa0 </strong>It’s a quiet, moody Metroidvania. That’s basically my favourite breed of this sort of thing, and <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2555390/Xanthiom_2/">Xanthiom 2</a></em> hit all the right notes for me. Doubly so since I was able to explore as I saw fit following the briefest of tutorials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well…okay that’s a bit of a misnomer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would’ve been able to explore as I saw fit, but the demo was limited in scope to just a handful of areas. Despite this, I still managed to find the entrances to 3 different areas that were off limits in the demo, which I’m going to take as meaning that I <em>could </em>have explored more freely were I not playing a demo. It was a promising sign, and has me hopeful that the full game will actually let me roam freely even if I get myself killed in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other really neat thing here was the return of modular gun customization from the original game. This lets players tweak the properties of their weapon for both puzzle solving, and combat related challenges. For example, one of the doors in the demo requires your weapon to have both a 50% range increase, and 50% fire rate increase mod installed to trigger the locking mechanism. It’s a really neat system with a ton of potential, and I’m keen to see exactly how it’s leveraged throughout the full game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think it’s high time I finally get around to the original game, <em>Xanthiom Zero</em>, which I’ve been meaning to play for a couple of months now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cairn">Cairn</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>A game about rock climbing. I promise that’s way more interesting than I just made it sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>It’s a little surprising to me that it took until (relatively) recently for games to start exploring rock climbing as a form of movement. In my mind, it shares a lot of overlap with one of video gaming’s oldest genres: platforming. The core difference being that you’re deciding where to place your character’s hands, instead of where to place your character’s feet. In both cases, there is a large focus on movement, and figuring out how to reach your destination with said movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there’ve been an array of indie titles released over the past few years to rectify this shortcoming from <em>Valley Peaks</em>, to <em>Jusant</em>, to <em>PEAK</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, thus far there hasn’t been a game that’s tried to realistically simulate the experience of rock climbing. All of those aforementioned titles sacrifice realism for accessibility, and a smoother gameplay experience. That is not the case for <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">Cairn</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say that <em>Cairn </em>is painfully realistic would be an understatement. When you misplace your footing, you fall. When you land, it hurts. A lot. And the injuries impede your ability to climb back up to where you fell from. Plus you’ll need to keep Aava, <em>Cairn’s </em>protagonist, fed and hydrated because she’ll build up fatigue a lot faster without any fuel in the tank, which will only make climbing harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you know what? There’s a strange sort of serenity born out of accepting all of this, and silently overcoming it. I had a few tumbles, but I kept getting back up until I eventually conquered the demo. This all left me with the impression that <em>Cairn </em>will be an almost meditative experience for a certain type of person, and I think that I’m here for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, if anyone from the development team happens to read this: y’all need someone, or a team of someones to make the game run a smidge better. I ran into a lot of performance issues with the demo, despite running it on the lowest settings. I eventually managed to get a stable framerate, but using the flashlight at night still tanked performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it’d be a shame if optimization related shenanigans mire the reception to <em>Cairn </em>as it’s a really interesting experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="crashout-crew">Crashout Crew</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>a new co-op game from <em>Aggro Crab</em> (the co-creators of <em>PEAK</em>) where you, and up to 4 friends play forklift drivers in a mayhem filled warehouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I feel like I might catch some flack for this (since I didn’t really like <em>PEAK</em>), but I had a lot of fun playing <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583210/Crashout_Crew/">Crashout Crew</a></em>. I think a lot of that comes down to the common DNA that it shares with <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2019/01/20/overcooked-2-review/">Overcooked</a></em>. Driving around a warehouse to prep a variety of ridiculous deliveries while meteors shower down from the heavens has a very similar energy to the chaotic kitchens of <em>Overcooked’s </em>best levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I do feel like <em>Crashout Crew </em>doesn’t have the same sorts of levers for ratcheting up tension as <em>Overcooked</em>. While playing with my wife, it was very easy to segregate different tasks, so that we never had to actually cross paths with one another. And a lot of the game’s difficulty bottoms out when you’re not crashing into one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that might have been a result of us not using proximity voice chat since we’re sitting less than 10 feet from one another. I have to assume <em>Crashout Crew</em> is a lot more chaotic when you can’t clearly relay information between 2 players who’re constantly on opposite sides of a level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those f-king chickens still got us once they started running around though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I think it’s fair to say that <em>Aggro Crab</em> has the makings of another hit multiplayer game on their hands here. The simplicity of <em>Crashout Crew</em> keeps the skill floor low enough so that anyone with a willing group of friends can jump right in, and have a good time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh right. Hats! The game has funny hats. My favourite thing!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-medium"><img alt="Funny Karen hairstyle from Crashout Crew." class="wp-image-9638" height="293" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/karen-hair.png?w=300" width="300" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>One of them is even this ridiculous Karen looking hair. If that doesn’t make <em>Crashout Crew</em> an all timer then I don’t know what does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, we’re done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m acutely aware of how late I’ll be posting this. Thankfully, most developers leave their demos live after <em>Next Fest</em> concludes, so you should be able to play the demo for any titles that caught your eye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, again, don’t forget about wishlisting. It’s free, and helps a ton.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

Here’s the list of games I was playing throughout September:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#ggst">Guilty Gear Strive</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#sudoku">Sudoku</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; it was a bit of a light month. That’s entirely my fault.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ggst">Guilty Gear Strive</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m sure this will come as a surprise to no one: <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> dominated my gaming time throughout September. The addition of the <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/">newly improved ranked mode</a>, and proper matchmaking made <em>Strive </em>a lot more fun to play when compared against my previous experience with the game. Turns out I’ll actually stick around for longer sessions if I’m not constantly being bombarded by messages about connection failure. Who’d a thunk it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the main draw for my time commitment throughout September was twofold: updating my <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/01/19/guilty-gear-strive-may-guide-for-beginner-combos/">May Beginners Guide</a>, and playing more Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The May guide took about 10 days of on again, off again work to actually hammer through, but I’m fairly pleased with how it turned out. In general, I think the guide does a better job of handing new players safer combo routing that they can use as a springboard for playing May.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also ended up redoing all of the videos for said guide, which meant that I could finally remove all of the background noise. I didn’t even realize it, but <em>Strive </em>plays a wind sound effect passively in the background of every stage. Normally, this extra sound is imperceptible because of the game’s music, but it’s very apparent when you have said music muted so people can’t tell how often you’re cutting between shots in an edited combo video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, those videos feel like they’re better put together now. It was definitely worth the effort even though it took me over a day’s worth of effort to capture, edit, and render 22 new videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing the May guide, my attention fell squarely on Dizzy. Originally, I’d intended to keep bouncing back and forth between her, and May. However, I had so much fun playing Dizzy that I just kept playing her, and eventually reached parity between the 2. At least, that’s true as far as my online ranking is concerned. I’m still far more comfortable using May in bracket, and am much better at putting together loose spaghetti combos with May than I am with Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Dizzy is far more fun to play now than she was before, which I was really surprised by. I wrote about it in length <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/09/27/revisiting-dizzy-at-the-end-of-strive-season-4/">here</a>, but the short version is that Dizzy has more situations where she can score a knockdown which increases her consistency. This is a stark contrast to when Dizzy first launched, and stray hits wouldn’t result in any follow through unless you had Ice Field active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I won’t profess to be an expert, I have had a lot of fun using Dizzy’s different tools to completely lock down my opponents. Nothing feels quite like keeping someone jailed at the far end of the screen while they helplessly flail around. Doubly so because smothering someone to death is non-trivial thanks to the bevy of movement options that exist. I guess Totsu was right all those months ago when he told me that I’d probably enjoy playing a zoner in <em>Strive</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I think the biggest takeaway here is that I’ve been enjoying the process of learning again. Fighting games, specifically <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, were starting to feel really stagnant for me over the past few months. Returning to <em>Strive</em>, and focusing (mostly) on a new character have helped to really reignite my passion for the genre. I think there might be something to that, but I’d prefer to explore it in detail within a dedicated post, so I’ll put a pin in that for later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sudoku">Sudoku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; I’ve continued to play <em>Sudoku</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t have a whole lot to say on this front, but I’ve gotten a lot better at solving the <em>NYT</em>, and <em>LA Times’</em> boards by sticking to Schneider notation. This involves only marking out when a number can appear in 2 different cells within a box, row, or column. The main advantage here is that you don’t clutter the entire <em>Sudoku </em>board with information that can’t be acted upon, while also providing yourself with better information to fill in additional spaces whenever you place another number.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This video probably explains it better, honestly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, as someone who typically struggles to solve boards when there are too many candidates listed across several spaces, I really like Schneider notation. It makes many of these more challenging puzzles a lot more approachable than they were when I’d get buried in the weeds of numerous different candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is an unfortunate downside of Schneider notation: it forced me to learn at a pace that I didn’t find particularly accommodating. Schneider notation is heavily reliant on the <em>Sudoku </em>player’s ability to reliably spot, and infer intersections while solving the puzzle in question. As a result, I had to get a LOT better at spotting this pattern so I could actually make use of this particular solving strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, it’s cool that I can use Schneider notation as I find it far easier to solve puzzles by using it. On the other hand, I’d have appreciated a more gradual build up to this point. Instead, I feel like I immediately rushed hard mode, which added a lot of friction to the entire learning process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, <em>Sudoku </em>is still very fun, and very satisfying. I’d highly recommend checking it out, especially if you’re looking for a way to give your brain a daily mental workout.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like so many other people, I was playing <em>Silksong </em>throughout September. What might surprise you is that I didn’t start playing it until the 20th, so I’ve not actually finished the game yet. I do think I’m over the halfway mark though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also going to skip actually introducing what <em>Silksong </em>is because I’m assuming everyone, and their dog already knows about this game. It was the source of many memes, and much speculative hype right up until it came out. This was swiftly followed by people complaining about the game being too hard, which I can&#8217;t comment on because I started playing it after the first difficulty nerf patch went live.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, <em>Silksong </em>is a game of high peaks, and low valleys for me. The areas where it meaningfully improves upon its predecessor make <em>Silksong </em>among one of my favourite games to bless the Metroidvania subgenre. However, there are a few aspects of <em>Silksong </em>that I actively question because they repeatedly interrupt the flow of exploration, and largely contribute to it feeling like a less well put together package than its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I kind of want to cover off exactly what I mean by all of that in a longer post, but I’m afraid I’ll get lost in the weeds while writing so here’s the Cliff’s notes version:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>The music by Chris Larkin is fantastic</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The wider variety of environments, and greater use of colour are a welcome change</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hornet’s movement abilities feel fantastic to use, and help to immediately distinguish her from the previous title’s hero</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enemy and boss designs (both visual, and mechanical) are great</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The newly added Crest system provides a much needed revamp to the Badge system of the previous title</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Side quests actively detract from the game, and feel like unnecessary padding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The propensity for <em>Silksong </em>to lock players into combat arenas with a deluge of common enemies is boring, predictable, and also feels like unnecessary padding</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, I’ve been having a lot of fun exploring every corner of the game, but I can’t shake the feeling that <em>Silksong </em>is collapsing under its own weight. It feels a lot more overtly video game-y, and bloated in the way that open world games do thanks to the inclusion of really nebulous side quests, and combat arenas. When I’m able to quietly explore, and untangle its labyrinthine maze of a world, I’m at my happiest. However, <em>Silksong </em>seems <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/10/20/i-dont-want-to-hold-your-hand-silksong/">hellbent on ensuring that those moments are few and far between</a> thanks to an endless deluge of unnecessary interruptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully that explains what I meant by high peaks, and low valleys.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I decided that I wanted something less action-y to play in my evenings so I started up <em>Strange Horticulture</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I say that, but I also wanted to see if I even enjoyed the game. The reason being is Mir wanted to play the sequel, <em>Strange Antiquities</em>, alongside me instead of playing it alone like she did with the first game. As such, I’ve been working my way through <em>Strange Horticulture</em> the past few evenings, so I could give an informed yay or nay to that request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who were as blissfully unaware of this game as I was, <em>Strange Horticulture</em> is a game where you run a shop by the same name, which sells strange plants. Unfortunately, none of the plants are actually labelled, so it’s your job to research, and deduce which plants are which. Ergo, this is a bit of a Detective game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, most of the puzzles haven’t been that involved, and it doesn’t seem like that’ll change either. Instead, the occult story that’s been brewing in the background is starting to take hold, so that appears like it’ll be the focus of the back half of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little disappointed by the lack of puzzles, but I am keen to see where the story goes. Hopefully <em>Strange Horticulture</em> can wrap things up in a satisfying sort of way before I completely check out due to the lack of puzzle variety, and challenge though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for whether I’ll play the sequel with my wife, I guess you’ll have to tune in next month to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, I think we’ll call it for September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, as always, for reading if you made it this far, and stay safe out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

The announcement and release of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/07/23/every-card-is-a-puzzle-in-monster-train-2/">Monster Train 2</a></em> was totally unexpected, <em>Silksong </em>&amp; <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/06/19/surface-runs-add-a-fresh-new-twist-to-hades-2/">Hades 2</a></em> both shadow dropped this month, and <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/"><em>Strive </em>received a proper ranked mode</a> 4 years after its initial release. There were also games like <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/09/02/month-in-review-duck-detective-peak-grounded-2-more/#ooo">Öoo</a></em>, <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/29/tactical-space-invaders-starvaders-review/">StarVaders</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/07/genius-deduction-the-roottrees-are-dead-review/">The Roottrees are Dead</a></em> which totally blew me away despite the limited fanfare they received in the lead up to their respective launch dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, 2025 doesn’t appear to be slowing down with the surprises because a demo for <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> dropped 2 weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who aren’t already aware, this is the next project from <em>Radical Fish Games</em>, the creators of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2018/11/21/crosscode-review/">CrossCode</a></em>. Yes &#8211; that <em>CrossCode</em>. The same <em>CrossCode </em>with gorgeous pixel art, fantastic puzzle-filled dungeons, and one of the most heartfelt narratives that I’ve ever experienced in a video game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say that I’m a little excited about <em>Radical Fish Games’</em> next project would be an understatement. Learning about, and subsequently playing the demo for <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> was akin to my experience with <em>Monster Train 2</em> earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, said demo has fanned the flames of my excitement, and now I’m very much looking forward to the <em>Early Access</em> release of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>, which is (currently) slated for the first half of 2026.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself (again).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome back to another <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/tag/demo-dive/">Demo Dive</a></em> where today we’ll be taking a look at <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>, <em>Radical Fish Games’</em> follow-up to <em>CrossCode</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, let’s start by answering the question: what is <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to <em>CrossCode</em>, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> is an Action RPG with many of the trappings of RPGs from the 16-bit era. That is to say it has the simple, but satisfying combat of something like <em>Diablo</em>, but the narrative structure and cadence of something like <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, or <em>Earthbound</em>. It’s a blending that works quite well for someone like myself who has little patience for simple turn-based combat, but otherwise doesn’t mind the winding narrative structure typical in this sort of RPG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I appreciated some of the changes that <em>Radical Fish</em> has made when compared to their previous work namely as it relates to combat. If memory serves, <em>CrossCode </em>was very button mashy in the combat department with a simple 3 hit combo, alongside a handful of special moves. By comparison, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> features a few more combo types, which players can access by inputting their attacks with a slightly different rhythm. It’s akin to how many other 2D action games have implemented their combo systems, and it makes a welcome appearance here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> features several weapon types which each have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, the sword is fast, but deals less damage than the bulky hammer making it ideal for players who want to attack more aggressively. However, the sword only deals slicing damage, which makes it totally ineffective against enemies with tough shells. That’s where the hammer will come in handy. As such, players need to adjust their approach in combat to account for the different weaknesses of what they’re fighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a really big fan of this addition as it makes combat just that little bit more involved. It’s not so overbearing as to become the focus of the game, but it does lend itself to making fights feel like an active component of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> instead of the thing you do to fill time in between everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from combat, the other aspects that <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo was keen to showcase are the return of Zelda-esque dungeons, and the narrative hook for the story. Unfortunately, you’re only allowed to explore the first dungeon up to the point where you unlock the dungeon’s key item, meaning that the majority of the interesting puzzles, and combat encounters are locked beyond the confines of the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I wouldn’t be upset about being cut off were I not having fun. What’s on offer was really enjoyable even if it was limited in scope. Besides, <em>CrossCode </em>has some of the best constructed puzzle dungeons that I’ve ever played through, so I have every confidence that <em>Radical Fish</em> will deliver in full force with this area of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final bit that I wanted to touch on with regard to <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo is the story. I won’t be speaking about the specifics &#8211; the demo is around 2 hours long, so you can play it yourself if you’re curious. Instead, I wanted to focus on how <em>Radical Fish</em> smartly uses hooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The demo begins with a brief introduction that speaks of a world ending apocalypse (named Nyx), which is swiftly followed by a tutorial section wherein you play as some of the chosen heroes meant to repel said apocalypse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things don’t quite work out though, so everything is a little out of sorts once players take control of <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> protagonist Juno.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then learn that Juno was meant to be travelling with the group of heroes we saw during the tutorial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my money, this setup was perfect. It immediately introduced the game world, set up 2 different sources of conflict, and left me with questions that I’m interested in pursuing the answers to. For example, why wasn’t Juno with the party of chosen heroes? That immediately introduces some intrigue, while also setting up a source of conflict to build the story around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might sound like I’m praising <em>Radical Fish</em> for doing the bare minimum, but you’d be surprised just how many games get this wrong. Basically any author worth their salt knows this sort of introduction is an easy way to draw the reader into your story. It gives them something to latch onto so they can cruise through the remaining character introductions throughout the opening act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, writing is rarely the focal point for many games. As such, games are usually a lot more reliant on visual set pieces, or mechanical complexity for drawing players in. It’s for this reason that I found <em>Radical Fish’s</em> use of narrative hooks so refreshing. Doubly so since it communicated to me that they’re looking to make the story of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> as much of a focal point as it was in <em>CrossCode</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, I’m typically a much more mechanically minded player &#8211; I think even a cursory glance at my other written work will reveal as much &#8211; so <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> getting its narrative hooks into me has gotta count for something, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I close out here, there are 2 other things that I wanted to (briefly) mention: the artwork, and music. I already thought <em>Radical Fish’s</em> previous work looked great, but the pixel art, and character animation are even more well done here. It’s almost unbelievable how good the game looks. Kudos to the art team!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along those same lines, I thought all of the music within <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo was great. Every track fit the accompanying locale, cutscene, or set piece to a tee which did a lot of heavy lifting for setting the appropriate tone throughout the demo. Again, big kudos to the folks responsible for the music as you absolutely nailed the assignment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that I think I’ve covered everything that I wanted to say about <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>. Obviously, I’m coming at it from the lens of someone who both played, and really enjoyed <em>CrossCode</em>, which might not be true for all of you. I feel like the demo showed that <em>Radical Fish</em> are doubling down on what made <em>CrossCode </em>so great, and I’m very eager to get my hands on the full release whenever they finish cooking it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I’ll have to wait a fair bit as <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> is planned for an <em>Early Access</em> launch in the first half of 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, if you’d like to check out the demo for yourself &#8211; and I think you should as it’s fantastic &#8211; then you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3110760/Alabaster_Dawn/">here via <em>Steam</em></a>.

My general takeaways were mostly negative even though I found her really fun to play. There were a lot of small reasons for that, but the biggest unifying theme of my complaints was that her design felt muddled. Her tools seemed built with zoning in mind, but she was fairly mediocre at keep-out. She wasn’t much better at traditional strike-throw offense either, which left Dizzy in this weird limbo state where she couldn’t do anything particularly well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t the only person who came to this conclusion about Dizzy either. Over the next several weeks, countless tier lists were published by different notable players, and every single one of them put Dizzy in the bottom tier. Heck, some even said she was the worst character in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this isn’t the first time that people have claimed a newly released character was the worst in <em>Strive</em>, so it’s important to take such claims with a grain of salt. Infamously, some said that Happy Chaos was trash when he was first released. In the following months, Happy Chaos crept to the top of most player’s tier lists, and also won <em>EVO </em>2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, in fairness, that <em>EVO </em>win came after Happy Chaos received totally unnecessary buffs to the majority of his attacking moves. This was done as a way to compensate for a nerf to the character’s zoning capabilities, but many considered this change a massive net positive for the Happy Chaos playerbase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the point remains that many people had grossly underestimated the strength of Happy Chaos upon his initial release. As such, it wasn’t unreasonable to think that myself, and others might have missed the mark with Dizzy too. Perhaps there was something we’d missed that would unlock the true potential of the character.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as weeks turned into months, people continued to nod their head in agreement about Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, this was extremely vindicating. I don’t always have the most confidence in my opinions as it relates to Fighting games, so it was nice to see a bunch of other players (at various levels of play) all coming to the same conclusion that I did with my initial assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this also kind of sucked because I really enjoyed playing Dizzy (when she worked). That sort of sentiment shouldn’t ever stop you from playing a character that you enjoy, but it’s hard to maintain a consistent level of enthusiasm when you’re reminded how much easier it’d be to just play somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there were 2 major balance patches to <em>Strive </em>between when I last played Dizzy and now. Surely, <em>Arc System Works</em> buffed her to a point where she can actually compete, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>…Right?</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Guilty Gear Strives version 1.43 patch notes for Dizzy where she was nerfed just as much as she was buffed." class="wp-image-9603" height="508" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dizzy-patch-notes-v-143.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Guys?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All joking aside, here’s the list of (relevant) changes that Dizzy received across those 2 patches:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>For Roasting Chestnuts (236K)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>First hit no longer counts as a projectile &amp; hitbox size increased</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Causes a knockdown on hit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can now neutralize other projectiles</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Far Slash (f.S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Increased hitbox</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crouching Slash (2S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Increased hitbox</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Michael Sword (214S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Causes a knockdown on hit</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I Used This to Catch Fish (236S|H)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>More than doubled the active frames of the attack</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frozen State\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>No longer (erroneously) triggers a wall break</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a change that buffed the power of Yellow Roman Cancel, and damage was nerfed across the board. Both of these changes were huge for Dizzy since it increased her defensive utility, and brought her damage output inline with the rest of the cast. In fact, you could reasonably argue that Dizzy was one of the biggest beneficiaries of both changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, after a few more weeks of playing Dizzy, what do I think of her now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a short video that I believe accurately captures my impressions:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This character is a lot better at zoning now. Her tools actually compliment one another thanks to the additional knockdown opportunities afforded by both versions of Michael Sword, and Chestnut. In all cases, Dizzy has the option to set up additional projectiles, Wings of Light, or Ice Field which allows her to run her gameplan a lot more consistently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, she has stronger tools (namely For Roasting Chestnuts) for challenging the other cast members when she gets into a zoning war. This means that she doesn’t feel completely defenseless like she used to when she had to rely solely on I Used This to Catch Fish, which was too slow to meaningfully challenge most of the cast with any degree of consistency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the massive buff to I Used This to Catch Fish is certainly the highlight of the current patch, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find the changes to Chestnut from the previous patch to be more impactful. It’s actually wild how much mileage I can get out of this special attack now. It helps to keep folks locked down, and the added knockdown makes it very easy to consistently place Ice Field. This is notable as the added icy terrain makes it much harder for opponents to approach Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I can’t overlook the changes to I Used This to Catch Fish. The almost <em>40 frames</em> that this attack is active for is insane. I’ve caught so many people off guard with this attack because it’s active for so long. I think it sits firmly in gimmick territory, but I’d be lying if I said that it wasn’t an effective gimmick. And that makes it a nice option to exercise, especially against players who’re unfamiliar with Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also loving the hitbox changes on Dizzy’s Slash normals. The extended hitbox on Far Slash has led to several instances where I’ve had it clash with an opponent’s reversal (invulnerable get-off me attacks like Shoryuken), which led to an advantageous follow-up for me. This is the sort of power I was used to wielding while playing May, and having it now on Dizzy has made her feel a lot better overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Crouching Slash is basically just May’s Crouching Slash from before it was nerfed to be 10% slower. That attack was best-in-class prior to the nerf, so Dizzy having an equally strong attack here feels so good. Plus, Crouching Slash was (it still is, honestly) my favourite way to control space with May, and it works just as well on Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All said, I think Dizzy is in a much better place now than she was when she first released. She feels like a solid middle of the pack character, with well defined strengths to accompany her many weaknesses. She has a very strong presence from everywhere on the screen, and can easily suffocate her opponent after she builds up some momentum. That said, all of her attacks have exploitable dead zones, and she still struggles to cover the space above her head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I’ve continued to have a ton of fun playing Dizzy. More so than before I’d wager. I wasn’t expecting much given how few changes she’s received over the past year, but it seems like those changes targeted the areas where Dizzy needed the most help. Now she feels like a strong zoner with unique tools, instead of direction-less generalist with meagre damage output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also felt comfortable enough to use Dizzy last week in bracket at locals, and I won all 5 games where I played her. Granted, I was still playing May for the majority of my games, but it was nice to finally show off the work I’ve been putting in with Dizzy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s hoping that I continue to have fun as I progress even further with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

I have a really hard time empathizing with how tricky someone else will find different types of puzzles. That can make it hard to communicate exactly why a particular Puzzle game did or did not work for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as an example, my friends Charlie and Thomas are both very logical thinkers, and can juggle a bunch of abstract information in their minds. As a result, they find a lot of Puzzle games far too simple. There’ve been very few instances over the years where I’ve recommended a Puzzle game to either of them, and had them come back saying they actually enjoyed it. Instead, I usually get hit with, “It was neat, but a little too simple.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So…you know…that doesn’t exactly make me very confident in my abilities to recommend Puzzle games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I finished a demo for <em>The Art of Reflection</em> earlier this week, and I had to talk about it. Mostly because it is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, I’ll start Demo Dive with a brief overview of <em>The Art of Reflection</em>, though I think the attached trailer does a fairly good job of showcasing what the game is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Art of Reflection</em> is a First-Person Puzzle game with realistically simulated mirrors. Also, you can enter the mirrors. This is the foundation from which <em>The Art of Reflection</em> builds all of its puzzles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a quick example of exactly what that entails, 1 of the first puzzles that players are asked to solve in the demo involves a locked door, and a key. Unfortunately, the door requires a mirrored version of the key that you’re provided with. Luckily, you can pop through a mirror, grab a mirrored version of the key, and return to the original door which you’ll now be able to open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s notes: I only realized after the fact that this is the first puzzle in the trailer, and now feel like a doofus for using it as an example. Still &#8211; you get the idea!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a fairly basic puzzle, but that should give you an idea of what <em>The Art of Reflection</em> has going on. It’s puzzles built around reflection, and perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, I was a little dubious about how much mileage the developers <a href="https://x.com/hydrozoagames">Hydrozoa</a> could get out of that idea, but the demo did a lot to assuage my concerns. Every new room I entered either presented a completely new idea, or meaningfully built upon a previous puzzle. That gave the whole demo a great sense of momentum, and also made the whole thing very satisfying to unravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I do have to call out my favourite moment from the demo, so skip this paragraph if you don’t want to be spoiled. The first time I entered a mirror on the ceiling, and inverted gravity was so cool. I was not expecting that at all, but playing around with gravity by flipping the entire world upside down was a really neat twist on the game’s core mechanics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also got the sense that I missed a few different puzzles throughout the demo. There were these collectible pillars that you were awarded for completing several consecutive rooms. Each one seemed to increase the amount of music playing for all of the levels attached to a particular hub. I figured that the demo didn’t contain all of the levels, specifically so the developers could showcase the breadth of ideas that they had, but the message at the end of the demo makes me think that I just missed several puzzles that were hidden off the beaten path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that’s the case, that’s also really neat. I’m always a fan of Puzzle games hiding additional puzzles behind these sorts of challenges. It’s a bit of a twist on simply solving a level to unlock the next since you need to work out exactly where the hidden thing is in the first place. That’s a commitment to puzzle solving that I can appreciate in a Puzzle game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you miss those hidden levels, it’s not really a big deal? Most Puzzle games are satisfying to solve irrespective of whether or not you completed all of their most tricky conundrums. Hell, most players won’t even notice that they’ve missed anything unless you tell them. My experience is proof positive of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I think <em>The Art of Reflection</em> looks very promising. The demo has certainly wet my appetite for the full game, which releases on November 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to try <em>The Art of Reflection</em> for yourself, there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2290770/The_Art_of_Reflection/">demo currently available on Steam</a>. And don’t forget to wishlist the game if you enjoyed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

[...] not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which [everyone] shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position&#x201d;</blockquote><p>I wanted to know what these words meant to us today. I needed to know what parts of the American Dream we all still had in common. I had to make some sense of what was happening to our country. I&#x2019;ve been writing on my blog since 2004, and on November 7th, I started writing the most difficult piece I have ever written. </p><p>I asked so many Americans to tell me what the American Dream personally meant to them, and I wrote it all down.</p><p>Later in November, I attended a theater performance of The Outsiders at my son&#x2019;s public high school &#x2013; an adaptation of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1742507328643679&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GgwTbUV3qWhPvsHuYFgy7" rel="noreferrer">the 1967 novel by S.E. Hinton</a>. All I really knew was the famous &#x201c;stay gold&#x201d; line from the 1983 movie. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what &#x201c;stay gold&#x201d; meant: <em>sharing the American Dream.</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="2894" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_7003.jpg" width="2000" /></figure><p>We cannot merely attain the Dream. The dream is incomplete until we share it with our fellow Americans. That act of sharing is the final realization of everything the dream stands for.</p><p>Thanks to S.E. Hinton, I finally had a name for my essay, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/" rel="noreferrer">&#x201c;Stay Gold, America.&#x201d;</a> I published it on January 7th, with a <strong>Pledge to Share the American Dream</strong>.</p><p>In the first part of the Pledge, the short term, our family made eight 1 million dollar donations to the following nonprofit groups: <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.org/" rel="noreferrer">Team Rubicon</a>, <a href="https://childrenshungerfund.org/" rel="noreferrer">Children&#x2019;s Hunger Fund</a>, <a href="https://pen.org/">PEN America</a>, <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/" rel="noreferrer">The Trevor Project</a>, <a href="https://www.naacpldf.org/" rel="noreferrer">NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.firstgenerationinvestors.com/" rel="noreferrer">First Generation Investors</a>, <a href="https://www.globalrefuge.org/" rel="noreferrer">Global Refuge</a>, and <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/" rel="noreferrer">Planned Parenthood</a>. </p><p>Beyond that, we made many additional one million dollar donations to reinforce our technical infrastructure in America &#x2013; <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://archive.org" rel="noreferrer">The Internet Archive</a>, <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/" rel="noreferrer">The Common Crawl Foundation</a>, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="noreferrer">Let&#x2019;s Encrypt</a>, pioneering independent internet journalism, and several other crucial open source software infrastructure projects that power much of the world today.</p><p>I encourage every American to <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/" rel="noreferrer">contribute soon</a>, however you can, to organizations you feel are effectively helping those most currently in need.</p><p>But short term fixes are not enough.</p><p>The <strong>Pledge To Share The American Dream</strong> requires a much more ambitious second act &#x2013; deeper, long term changes that will take decades. Over the next five years, my family pledges half our remaining wealth to plant a seed toward foundational long term efforts ensuring that all Americans continue to have the same fair access to the American Dream.</p><p>Let me tell you about my own path to the American Dream. It was rocky. My parents were born into deep poverty in Mercer County, West Virginia, and Beaufort County, North Carolina. Our family eventually clawed our way to the bottom of the middle class in Virginia. </p><p>I won&#x2019;t dwell on it, but every family has their own problems. We did not remain middle class for long. But through all this, my parents got the most important thing right: they loved me openly and unconditionally. That is everything. It&#x2019;s the only reason I am standing here in front of you today.</p><p>With my family&#x2019;s support, I managed to achieve a solid public education in Chesterfield County, Virginia, and had the incredible privilege of an affordable state education at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/aboutuva/" rel="noreferrer">University of Virginia</a>. This is a college uniquely rooted in the beliefs of one of the most prominent Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson. He was a living paradox. A man of profound ideals and yet flawed &#x2013; trapped in the values of his time and place. </p><p>Still, he wrote &#x201c;Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&#x201d; at the top of the Declaration of Independence. These words were, and still are, revolutionary. They define our fundamental shared American values, although we have not always lived up to them. The American Dream isn&#x2019;t about us succeeding, alone, by ourselves, but about connecting with each other and succeeding together as Americans.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been concerned about wealth concentration in America ever since I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM" rel="noreferrer">2012 video by politizane</a> illustrating just how extreme wealth concentration already was. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>I had no idea how close we were to the American Gilded Age from the late 1800s. This period was given a name in the 1920s by historians referencing Mark Twain&#x2019;s 1873 novel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gilded_Age:_A_Tale_of_Today" rel="noreferrer">The Gilded Age, A Tale of Today</a>. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="800" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-151.png" width="1200" /></figure><p>During this time, labor strikes often turned violent, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike" rel="noreferrer">Homestead Strike of 1892</a> resulting in deadly confrontations between workers and Pinkerton guards hired by factory owners. Rapid industrialization created hazardous working conditions in factories, mines, and railroads, where thousands died due to insufficient safety regulations and employers who prioritized profit over worker welfare.</p><p>In January 2025, while I was still writing <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/" rel="noreferrer">&#x201c;Stay Gold, America&#x201d;</a>, we entered the period of greatest wealth concentration in the entirety of American history. As of 2021, the <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-this-chart-explains-americans-wealth-across-income-levels/" rel="noreferrer">top 1% of households controlled 32% of all wealth</a>, while the bottom 50% only have 2.6%. It&#x2019;s difficult to find more recent data, but wealth concentration has only intensified in the last four years.</p><p>We can no longer say &#x201c;Gilded Age.&#x201d;</p><p>We must now say &#x201c;The First Gilded Age.&#x201d;</p><p>Today, in our <em>second</em> Gilded Age, more and more people find their path to the American Dream blocked. When Americans face unaffordable education, lack of accessible healthcare, or lack affordable housing, they aren&#x2019;t just disadvantaged &#x2013; they&#x2019;re trapped, often burdened by massive debt. They have no stable foundation to build their lives. They watch desperately, working as hard as they can, while life simply passes them by, without even the freedom to choose their own lives.</p><p>They don&#x2019;t have time to build a career. They don&#x2019;t have time to learn, to improve. They don&#x2019;t get to start a business. They can&#x2019;t choose where their kids will grow up, or whether to have children at all, because they can&#x2019;t afford to. Here in the land of opportunity, the pursuit of happiness has become an endless task for too many. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="1141" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-152.png" width="1178" /></figure><p>We are denying people any real chance of achieving the dream that we promised them &#x2013; that we promised the entire world &#x2013; when we founded this nation. It is such a profound betrayal of everything we ever dreamed about. Without a stable foundation to build a life on, our fellow Americans cannot even <em>pursue</em> the American Dream, much less achieve it.</p><p>I ask you this: as an American, what is the purpose of a dream left unshared with so many for so long? What&#x2019;s happening to our dream? Are we really willing to let go of our values so easily? We&#x2019;re Americans. We fight for our values, the values embodied in our dream, the ones we founded this country on. </p><p>Why aren&#x2019;t we sharing the American Dream? </p><p>Why aren&#x2019;t we giving everyone a fair chance at Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness by providing them the fundamentals they need to get there?</p><p>The Dream worked for me, decades ago, and I deeply believe that the American Dream can still work for everyone &#x2013; if we ensure every American has the same fair chance we did. The American Dream was never about a few people being extraordinarily wealthy. It&#x2019;s about everyone having an equal chance to succeed and pursue their dreams &#x2013; their own happiness. It belongs to them. I think we owe them at least that. I think we owe <em>ourselves</em> at least that.</p><p>What can we do about this? There are no easy answers. I can&#x2019;t even pretend to have the answer, because there isn&#x2019;t any one answer to give. Nothing worth doing is ever that simple. But I can tell you this: all the studies and all the data I&#x2019;ve looked at have strongly pointed to one foundational thing we can do here in America over the next five years.</p><p>Natalie Foster, co-founder of the <a href="https://economicsecurityproject.org/" rel="noreferrer">Economic Security Project</a>, makes a powerful case for the idea that, with all this concentrated wealth, we can offer a <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income</strong> in the poorest areas of this country &#x2013; the areas of most need, where money goes the farthest &#x2013; to unlock vast amounts of untapped American potential. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1620978466/"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="700" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/the-guarantee-book-natalie-foster-1.jpg" width="467" /></a></figure><p>This isn&#x2019;t a new idea. We&#x2019;ve been doing this a while now in different forms, but we never called it Guaranteed Minimum Income.</p><p>In <strong>1797</strong>, Thomas Paine proposed a retirement pension funded by estate taxes. It didn&#x2019;t go anywhere, but it planted a seed. Much later we implemented the Social Security Act in <strong>1935</strong> . The economic chaos of the Great Depression coupled with the inability of private philanthropy to provide economic security inspired Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s New Deal government programs. The most popular and effective program to emerge from this era was Social Security, providing a guaranteed income for retirees. Before Social Security, <em>half</em> of seniors lived in poverty. Today only 10% of seniors live in poverty.</p><p>In his <strong>1967</strong> book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Go_from_Here:_Chaos_or_Community%3F" rel="noreferrer">Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community</a>, Martin Luther King Jr made the moral case for a form of UBI, Universal Basic Income. King believed that economic insecurity was at the root of all inequality. He stated that a guaranteed income &#x2014; direct cash disbursements &#x2014; was the simplest and best way to fight poverty.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="1401" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-147.png" width="1920" /></figure><p>In <strong>1972</strong>, Congress established the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, providing direct cash assistance to low-income elderly, blind, and disabled individuals with little or no income. This cash can be used for food, housing, and medical expenses, the essentials for financial stability. As of January, 2025, over 7.3 million people receive SSI benefits.</p><p>In <strong>1975</strong>, Congress passed the Tax Reduction Act, establishing the Earned Income Tax Credit. This tax credit benefits working-class parents with children, encouraging work by increasing the income of low-income workers. In 2023, it lifted about 6.4 million people out of poverty, including 3.4 million children. <a href="https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.pdf" rel="noreferrer">According to the Census Bureau</a>, it is the second most effective anti-poverty tool after Social Security.</p><p>In <strong>2019</strong>, directly inspired by King, mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tubbs" rel="noreferrer">Michael Tubbs</a> &#x2013; at age 26, one of the youngest mayors in American history &#x2013; launched the $3 million <a href="https://www.stocktondemonstration.org/" rel="noreferrer">Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration</a>. It provided 125 residents with $500 per month in unconditional cash payments for two years. The program found that recipients experienced improved financial stability, increased full-time employment, and enhanced well-being.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="800" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-150.png" width="1200" /><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Michael Tubbs, Former Mayor of Stockton, on </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rSQCNd0Dr8" rel="noreferrer"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Creating a California for All</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>In my &#x201c;Stay Gold, America&#x201d; blog post, I referenced the Robert Frost &#x201c;Stay Gold&#x201d; poem and S.E. Hinton&#x2019;s famous famous novel The Outsiders, urging us to retain our youthful ideals as we grow older. Ideals embodied in the American Dream.</p><p>Which brings us to another Robert Frost poem, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken" rel="noreferrer">The Road Not Taken</a>. Our proposal to ensure access to the American Dream is to follow the path less travelled by:  <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income. </strong>GMI is a simpler, more practical, more scalable plan to directly address the root of economic insecurity with minimum bureaucracy.</p><p>We are partnering with GiveDirectly, who oversaw <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/united-states/" rel="noreferrer">the most GMI studies</a> in the United States, and OpenResearch, who just completed the <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/study" rel="noreferrer">largest, most detailed GMI study</a> ever conducted in this country in 2023. We are working together to launch a new Guaranteed Minimum Income initiative in <strong>rural American communities</strong>.</p><p>Network effects within communities explain why equality of opportunity is so effective, and why a shared American Dream is the most powerful dream of all. The potential of the American Dream becomes vastly greater as more people have access to it, <strong>because<em> they share it</em><em>.</em></strong></p><p>They share it with their families, their friends, and their neighbors. The groundbreaking, massive <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/documentation" rel="noreferrer">2023 OpenResearch UBI study data</a> showed that when you give money to the poorest among us, they consistently go <em>out</em> <em>of their way</em> to share that money with others in desperate need.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/documentation"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="966" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/openresearch-ubi-study-expenditures.png" width="1719" /></a></figure><p>The power of opportunity is not in what it can do for one person, but how it connects and strengthens bonds between people. When you empower a couple, you allow them to build a family. When you empower families, you allow them to build a community. When you guarantee fundamentals, you&#x2019;re providing a foundation for those connections to grow and thrive. This is the incredible power and value of community. That is what we are investing in &#x2013; each other.</p><p>A system where there are no guarantees creates conflict. It creates inequality. A massive concentration of wealth in so few hands weakens connections between us and prevents new ones. America began as a place of connection. Millions of us came together to build this nation, not individually, but together. Equality is connection, and connection is more valuable than any product any company will ever sell you.</p><p>Why focus on rural communities? There are consistently higher poverty rates in rural counties, with fewer job opportunities, lower wages, and worse access to healthcare and education. It&#x2019;s not a new problem, either &#x2014; places like Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, and American Indian reservations have been stuck in poverty for decades, with some counties like Oglala Lakota, SD (55.8%) and McDowell, WV (37.6%) hitting extreme levels. Meanwhile, urban counties rarely see numbers that high. The data from the US Census and USDA Economic Research Service make it clear: if you&#x2019;re poor in America, being rural makes it even harder to escape.</p><p>Rural areas also offer smaller populations, which is helpful because we need to start small with lots of tightly controlled studies that we can carefully scale and improve on for larger areas. We hope to build a large body of scientific data showing that GMI really does improve the lives, and the communities, of our fellow Americans.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="1067" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-149.png" width="1600" /></figure><h3 id="the-initial-plan-is-to-target-a-few-counties-that-i-have-a-personal-connection-to-and-are-still-currently-in-poverty-decades-later">The initial plan is to target a few counties that I have a personal connection to, and are still currently in poverty, decades later:</h3><ul><li>My father was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_County,_West_Virginia" rel="noreferrer">Mercer County</a>, West Virginia, where the collapse of coal mining left good people struggling to survive. Their living and their way of life is now all but gone, and good jobs are hard to find.</li><li>My mother&#x2019;s birthplace, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_County,_North_Carolina" rel="noreferrer">Beaufort County</a>, North Carolina, has been hit just as hard, with farming and factory jobs disappearing and families left wondering what&#x2019;s next.</li><li>Our third county is yet to be decided, but will be a community also facing the same systemic, generational obstacles to economic stability and achieving the American Dream.</li></ul><p>We will work with existing local groups to coordinate GMI studies where community members choose to enroll. We will conduct outreach and and provide mentorship to these opt-in study participants. It will be teamwork between Americans.</p><p>We hope Veterans will play a crucial role in our effort. We plan to work with local communities and veteran-serving organizations to engage veterans to support and execute our GMI programs &#x2013; the same veterans who served our country with distinction, returning home with exceptional leadership skills and a deep commitment to their communities. Their involvement ensures these programs reflect core American values of self-reliance and community service to fellow Americans. </p><p>We&#x2019;ll also partner with established community organizations &#x2014; churches, civic groups, community colleges, local businesses. These partnerships help integrate our GMI studies with existing support systems, rather than creating new ones.</p><p><a href="https://givedirectly.org/" rel="noreferrer">GiveDirectly</a> and <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/study" rel="noreferrer">OpenResearch</a> will build on their existing body of work, gathering extensive data from these refined studies. We&#x2019;ll measure employment, entrepreneurship, education, health, and community engagement. We&#x2019;ll conduct regular interviews with participants to understand their experience. How is this working for you? How can we make it better? You tell us. How can we make it better together?</p><p>Economic security isn&#x2019;t only about individual well-being &#x2013; it&#x2019;s the bedrock of democracy. When people aren&#x2019;t constantly worried about feeding themselves, feeding their family, having decent healthcare, having a place to live&#x2026; we have given them room to breathe. We have given them freedom. The freedom to raise their children, the freedom to start businesses, the freedom to choose where they work, the freedom to volunteer... the freedom to <em>vote</em>.</p><p>This isn&#x2019;t about ideology or government. It&#x2019;s about us, as Americans, working together to invest in our future &#x2013; possibly the greatest unlocking of human potential in our entire history. I do not say these things lightly. I&#x2019;ve seen it work. I&#x2019;ve looked at all the existing study data. A little bit of money is incredibly transformational for people in poverty &#x2013; the people who need it the most &#x2013; the people who cannot live up to their potential because they&#x2019;re so busy simply trying to survive. Imagine what they could do if we gave them just a little breathing room.</p><p>GMI is a long term investment in the future of what America should be, the way we wrote it down in the Declaration of Independence, perhaps incompletely &#x2013; but our democracy was always meant to be malleable, to change, to adapt, and improve.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income" class="kg-image" height="800" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-148.png" width="1200" /></figure><p>I&#x2019;d like to conclude by mentioning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz" rel="noreferrer">Aaron Swartz</a>. He was a precocious teenage programmer much like myself. Aaron helped develop RSS web feeds, co-founded Reddit, and worked with Creative Commons to create flexible copyright licenses for the common good. He used technology to make information universally accessible to everyone.</p><p>Aaron created a system to download public domain court documents from PACER, a government database that charged fees for accessing what he believed should be freely available public information. A few years later, while visiting MIT under their open campus policy and as a research fellow at Harvard, he used MIT&#x2019;s network to download millions of academic articles from JSTOR, another fee-charging online academic journal repository, intending to make this knowledge freely accessible. Since taxpayers had funded much of this research, why shouldn&#x2019;t that knowledge be freely available to everyone?</p><p>What Aaron saw as an act of academic freedom and information equality, authorities viewed as a crime&#x2014;he was arrested in January 2011 and charged with multiple felonies for what many considered to be nothing more than accessing knowledge that should have been freely available to the public in the first place.</p><p>Despite JSTOR declining to pursue charges and MIT eventually calling for leniency, federal prosecutors aggressively pursued felony charges against Aaron with up to 35 years in prison. Facing overwhelming legal pressure and the prospect of being labeled a felon, Aaron took his own life at 26. This sparked widespread criticism of prosecutorial overreach and prompted discussions about open access to information. Deservedly so. Eight days later, in this very hall, there was a standing room only memorial service praising Aaron for his commitment to the public good.</p><p>Aaron pursued what was right for we, the people. He chose to build the public good despite knowing there would be risks. He chose to be an activist. I think we should all choose to be activists, to be brave, to stand up for our defining American principles. </p><h2 id="there-are-two-things-i-ask-of-you-today">There are two things I ask of you today.</h2><ol><li>Visit <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/rural-us/">givedirectly.org/rural-us</a> where we&#x2019;ll be documenting our journey and findings from the initial three GMI rural county studies. Let&#x2019;s find out together how guaranteed minimum income can transform American lives.</li><li>Talk about <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income</strong> in your communities. Meet with your state and local officials. Share the existing study data. Share outcomes. Ask them about conducting GMI studies like ours in your area. We tell ourselves stories about why some people succeed and others don&#x2019;t. Challenge those stories. Economic security is not <em>charity</em>. It is an <em>investment</em> in vast untapped American potential in the poorest areas of this country.</li></ol><p>My family is committing 50 million dollars to this endeavor, but imagine if we had even more to share. Imagine how much more we could do, if we build this together, starting today. Decades from now, people will look back and wonder why it took us so long to share our dream of a better, richer, and fuller life with our fellow Americans.</p><p>I hope you join us on this grand experiment to share our American Dream. I believe everyone deserves a fair chance at what was promised when we founded this nation: Life, Liberty, and <em>the pursuit of The American Dream.</em></p>'}]}

I greatly admire the way Colonel Vindman was willing to put everything on the line to defend the ideals of democracy and the American Dream.</p><p>The American Dream is, at its core, the promise that hard work, fairness, and opportunity can lead to a better future. But in 2025, that promise feels like a question: <strong>How can we build on our dream so that it works for everyone?</strong></p><p>Alexander and I will explore this in our joint talk through the lens of democracy, community, and economic mobility. We come from very different backgrounds, but we strongly share the belief that everyone&apos;s American Dream is worth fighting for.</p><p>Alexander Vindman has lived many lifetimes of standing up for what&apos;s right. He was born in the Soviet Union and immigrated to the U.S. as a child, growing up in Brooklyn before enlisting in the U.S. Army. Over the next 21 years, he served with distinction, earning a Purple Heart for injuries sustained in Iraq and eventually rising to Director of European Affairs for the National Security Council. When asked to choose between looking the other way or upholding the values he swore to protect, he chose correctly. That decision cost him his career but never his integrity. I have a lot to learn about what civic duty truly means from Alex.</p><p>I build things on the Internet, like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://discourse.org/" rel="noreferrer">Discourse</a>. I write on the internet, on this blog. I&apos;ve spent years thinking about how people interact online, how communities work (or don&apos;t), and how we create digital spaces that encourage fairness, participation, and constructive discourse. Spaces that result in artifacts for the common good, like local parks, where everyone can enjoy them together. Whether you&apos;re running a country or running a forum, the same rules seem to apply: people need clear expectations, fair systems, strong boundaries, and a shared sense of purpose. </p><p>This is the part of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/" rel="noreferrer">Stay Gold</a> I couldn&apos;t tell you about, not yet, because I was working so hard to figure it out. How do you make long-term structural change that creates opportunity for everyone? It is an incredibly complex problem. But if we focus our efforts in a particular area, I believe we can change a lot of things in this country. Maybe not everything, but something foundational to the next part of our history as a country: <strong>how to move beyond individual generosity and toward systems that create security, dignity, and possibility for all</strong>.</p><p>I can&apos;t promise easy answers, but what I can promise is an honest, unfiltered conversation about how we move forward, with specifics. Colonel Vindman brings the perspective of someone who embodied American ideals, and I bring the experience of building self-governing digital communities that scale, which turned out to be far more relevant to the future of democracy than I ever would have dreamed possible.</p><p>Imagine what we can do if Alex and I work together. Imagine what we could do if we <em>all worked together</em>.</p><p>This event was streamed in real time via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-WfLn9ekLD9_-nL0zIyneXNKvii8r0MW" rel="noreferrer">Cooper Union Great Hall YouTube channel</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure>'}]}

Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn&#x2019;t forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. <br /><br />My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. <strong>They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. </strong></p><p>I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p><p>During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history" rel="noreferrer">federal minimum wage</a>, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with <a href="https://www.salliemae.com/blog/in-state-vs-out-of-state-tuition/" rel="noreferrer">lower in-state tuition</a>, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-year" rel="noreferrer">College tuition</a> at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years. These huge cost increases for healthcare, education, and housing are not compatible with the American Dream.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/chart-of-the-day-or-century-8/"><img alt="Stay Gold, America" class="kg-image" height="1141" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/consumer-price-increases-2020-2022.png" width="1178" /></a></figure><p>Programmers all over the world helped make an American Dream happen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080703183923/http://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noreferrer">in 2008</a> when we built <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a>, a Q&amp;A website for programmers creating a shared <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en" rel="noreferrer">Creative Commons</a> knowledge base for the world.

I earned millions of dollars. I thought that was the final part of the American Dream.

All I really knew was the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f46JMzVzSB4" rel="noreferrer">&#x201c;stay gold&#x201d; line</a> from the 1983 movie adaptation. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant: <a href="http://blog.asjournal.org/the-american-dream-reconsidered-the-outsiders-1967/" rel="noreferrer"><em>sharing</em> the American Dream</a>. </p><p>In the printed program, the director wrote:</p><blockquote>This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. <br /><br />We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and <strong>connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity</strong>.

Thank you for being part of this journey with us.<br /><br /><a href="https://poets.org/poem/nothing-gold-can-stay"><strong>Stay gold</strong></a><strong>.</strong></blockquote><p>I <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/im-loyal-to-nothing-except-the-dream/" rel="noreferrer">believe deeply</a> in sharing The American Dream. It is the foundation of our country, the second paragraph in our <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript" rel="noreferrer">Declaration of Independence</a>, written by the founder of the public university I attended:</p><blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</blockquote><p>But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rewinding-jimi-hendrixs-national-anthem" rel="noreferrer">captured this distortion</a> so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>We are still trying to live up to those ideals today.

Whatever the reasons, 42% of adults living in America had no say in the 2024 election. The vote <a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/" rel="noreferrer">failed to represent everyone</a>.</p><p>I think many of the Americans who did vote are telling us they no longer believe our government is effectively <em>keeping America fair for everyone</em>. Our status as the <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/ethics-leadership/democracy-index" rel="noreferrer">world&#x2019;s leading democracy</a> is in question. We should make it easier for more eligible Americans to vote, such as <strong>making election day a </strong><a href="https://www.actforamerica.org/act-now/Make-Election-Day-a-National-Holiday" rel="noreferrer"><strong>national holiday</strong></a><strong>, universal </strong><a href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/issues/universal-mailed-ballots#issues_map" rel="noreferrer"><strong>mail in voting</strong></a><strong>, and adopting </strong><a href="https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>ranked choice voting</strong></a> so all votes carry more weight. We should also strengthen institutions keeping democracy fair for everyone, such as state and local election boards, as well as the Federal Election Commission.<br /><br />It was only after I attained the dream that I was able to fully see how many Americans have so very little. This much wealth starts to unintentionally distance my family from other Americans. I no longer bother to look at how much items cost, because <em>I don&#x2019;t have to</em>. We don&#x2019;t have to think about all these things that are challenging or unreachable for so many others. The more wealth you attain, the more unmistakably clear it becomes how unequal life is for so many of us.<br /><br />Even with the wealth I have, I can&#x2019;t imagine what it would feel like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/democrats-harris-billionaire-mistake/680779/" rel="noreferrer">to be a billionaire</a><em>.</em> <strong>It is, for lack of a better word, </strong><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>unamerican</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>In 2012, the top 1% of Americans held 24% of our country&#x2019;s wealth.

The object of work is life, not income. The reward of production is plenty, not private fortune. We should measure the prosperity of a nation not by the number of millionaires, but by<strong> the absence of poverty, the prevalence of health, the efficiency of the public schools, </strong>and the number of people who can and do read worthwhile books<strong>. </strong>&#x2013; <a href="https://credo.library.umass.edu/view/full/mums312-b203-i031" rel="noreferrer">Du Bois</a></blockquote><p>Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#Types" rel="noreferrer">version of capitalism</a> delivered so much wealth to my family for my hard work in co-founding two successful companies. My partner and I gladly paid our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States" rel="noreferrer">full taxes</a>, and we always planned to give most of our remaining wealth to charities when we pass, following the <a href="https://givingpledge.org/pledger?pledgerId=177" rel="noreferrer">Warren Buffett Philanthropic Pledge</a>:</p><blockquote>More than 99% of my wealth will go to philanthropy during my lifetime or at death.</blockquote><p>I admire Buffett, but even having only a tiny fraction of his $325 billion fortune, to me this pledge was incomplete.

As the absence of extraterrestrial visitors does not categorically prove they do not exist, so the absence of time travelers fails to prove time travel is physically impossible; it might be that time travel is physically possible but is never developed or is cautiously used.

Something, somewhere, would certainly have invented it by now... right?</p><p>So if not, what happened? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Great Filter</a>&#xa0;maybe?</p><blockquote>The Great Filter theory says that at some point from pre-life to Type III intelligence, there&#x2019;s a wall that all or nearly all attempts at life hit.

I grant you that&#xa0;what we&#xa0;<em>can</em>&#xa0;observe is appallingly tiny&#xa0;given the unimaginable scale of the universe, so &#x201c;what we can observe&#x201d; may not be enough by many orders of magnitude.</p><p>I encourage you to read the entire article, it&#x2019;s full of great ideas explained well, including many other Great Filter possibilities. Mostly I wanted to share <strong>my personal theory of why we haven&#x2019;t encountered alien life by now</strong>. Like computers themselves, things don&#x2019;t get larger. They get <em>smaller</em>. And <em>faster</em>. And so does intelligent life. </p><blockquote>Why build planet-size anything when the real action is in the small things? Small spaces, small units of time, <strong>everything gets smaller</strong>.</blockquote><p>Large is inefficient and unnecessary. Look at the history of computers: from giant to tiny and tinier. From slow to fast and faster. Personally, I have a feeling really advanced life eventually does away with all physical stuff that slows you down as soon as they can, and enters <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-infinite-space-between-words/" rel="noreferrer">the infinite spaces between</a>:</p><blockquote>This is, of course, a variant on the Fermi paradox: We don&#x2019;t see clues to widespread, large-scale engineering, and consequently we must conclude that we&#x2019;re alone. But the possibly flawed assumption here is when we say that highly visible construction projects are an inevitable outcome of intelligence.&#xa0;<strong>It could be that it&#x2019;s the engineering of the small, rather than the large, that is inevitable.</strong>&#xa0;This follows from the laws of inertia (smaller machines are faster, and require less energy to function) as well as the speed of light (small computers have faster internal communication). It may be &#x2013; and this is, of course, speculation &#x2013; that advanced societies are building small technology and have little incentive or need to rearrange the stars in their neighborhoods, for instance. They may prefer to build nanobots instead.<br /><br />&#x2013; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040604012520/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/tech/nextnews/archive/next031104.htm" rel="noreferrer">Seth Shostak</a></blockquote><p>Seth delivers an excellent TED talk on this topic as well: </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>If we can barely see far in the universe as is, there&#x2019;s no way we could possibly see into the infinite space and time between.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>That is of course just my opinion, but <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/her" rel="noreferrer">we&#x2019;ll see</a>... eventually.</p>'}]}

There&#x2019;s a lot going on right now. It&#x2019;s a busy time. But let&#x2019;s pause and take a moment to celebrate that Elon Musk destroyed Twitter. I can&#x2019;t possibly <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/god-did-us-a-favor-by-destroying-twitter/" rel="noreferrer">say it better than Paul Ford</a>, so I&#x2019;ll just refer you there:</p><blockquote>Every five or six minutes, someone in the social sciences publishes a PDF with a title like &#x201c;Humans 95 Percent Happier in Small Towns, Waving at Neighbors and Eating Sandwiches.&#x201d; When we gather in groups of more than, say, eight, it&#x2019;s a disaster. Yet there is something fundamental in our nature that desperately wants to get everyone together in one big room, to &#x201c;solve it.&#x201d; Our smarter, richer betters (in Babel times, the king&#x2019;s name was Nimrod) often preach the idea of a town square, a marketplace of ideas, a centralized hub of discourse and entertainment &#x2013; and we listen. But when I go back and read Genesis, I hear God saying: &#x201c;My children, I designed your brains to scale to 150 stable relationships. Anything beyond that is overclocking. You should all try Mastodon.&#x201d;</blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s been clear for quite some time that the early social media strategery of &#x201c;jam a million people in a colosseum and let them fight it out with free speech&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t panning out, but never has it been more clear than now, under the Elon Musk regime, that being beholden to the whims of a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-isnt-funny-bad-jokes-twitter-1234712950/" rel="noreferrer">billionaire going through a midlife crisis</a> isn&#x2019;t exactly healthy for society. Or you. Or me. Or anyone, really.</p><p>I tried to be fair; I gave the post-Elon Twitter era a week, thinking &#x201c;how bad could it possibly be?&#x201d; and good lord, <em>it was so much worse than I could have possibly ever imagined</em>. It&#x2019;s like Elon read the Dilbert pointy-haired-manager book on management and bonked his head on every rung of the ladder going down, generating an ever-growing laundry <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-terrible-things-hes-said-and-done" rel="noreferrer">list of terrible things</a> no manager should ever do. And he <em>kept going!</em></p><p>It&#x2019;s undeniably sad. <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/twitter-service-vs-platform/" rel="noreferrer">I really liked Twitter</a>, warts and all, from 2007 onward. In fact, it was the only &#x201c;social network&#x201d; I liked at all. Even when it became clear in the Trump era that Twitter was unhealthy for human minds, I soldiered on, gleaning what I could. I&#x2019;m not alone in that; Clay Shirky&#x2019;s moribund signoff at the end of 2022 reflected how I felt:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="I Fight For The Users" class="kg-image" height="1478" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/08/image-252.png" width="1333" /></figure><p>Indeed, Twitter was murdered at the whims of a billionaire high on Ketamine while it was (mostly) healthy, because of <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/elon-musk-x-twitter-purchase-daughter-jenna-musk-woke-virus" rel="noreferrer">the &#x201c;trans woke virus&#x201d;</a>.  </p><p>I urge you, all of you, <strong>to disavow Twitter and never look at it again</strong>. No one who cares about their mental health should be on Twitter at this point, or linking to Twitter and feeding it the attention it thrives on. We should entomb Twitter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_message" rel="noreferrer">deep in concrete</a> with this <a href="https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1279277/" rel="noreferrer">public warning on its capstone</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="I Fight For The Users" class="kg-image" height="1461" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-248.png" width="1293" /></figure><p>In the end, I begrudgingly realized, as did Paul Ford, that Elon unwittingly did us a favor by killing Twitter. He demonstrated <strong>the very real dangers of any platform run by a king, a dictator, a tyrant, a despot, an autocrat</strong>. You can have all your content rug-pulled out from under you at any time, or watch in horror as your favorite bar... slowly transforms into a Nazi bar. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="I Fight For The Users" class="kg-image" height="1920" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/08/image--2-.png" width="1363" /></figure><p>I&#x2019;ve been saying for a long time that decentralization is the way to go. We can and should have sane centralized services, of course, but <strong>it&#x2019;s imperative that we <em>also</em> build decentralized services which empower users and give them control</strong>, rather than treating them <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/are-you-a-digital-sharecropper/" rel="noreferrer">like digital sharecroppers</a>. That&#x2019;s what our <a href="https://discourse.org/" rel="noreferrer">Discourse project</a> is all about. I propose collective ownership of the content and the communities we build online. Yeah, it&#x2019;s more work, it&#x2019;s not &#x201c;free&#x201d; (sorry not sorry), but I have some uncomfortable news for you: those so-called &#x201c;free&#x201d; services <em>aren&#x2019;t really free</em>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="I Fight For The Users" class="kg-image" height="454" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-249.png" width="521" /></figure><p>Which, again, is not to say that &#x201c;free&#x201d; services don&#x2019;t have a place in the world, they do, but please don&#x2019;t harbor any illusions about what you are sacrificing in the name of &#x201c;free.&#x201d; Grow up.</p><p>I take a rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron" rel="noreferrer">Tron-like</a> view of the world when it comes to this stuff; in the software industry, our goal should be to <em>empower</em> users (with strong moderation tools), not exploit them. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="I Fight For The Users" class="kg-image" height="640" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-250.png" width="504" /></figure><p>So I encourage you to explore alternatives to Twitter, ideally open source, federated alternatives. Is it messy? <em>Hell yes it&#x2019;s messy</em>. But so is democracy; it&#x2019;s worth the work, because it&#x2019;s the only survivable long term path forward.

If you knew the right commands, you could type them in to load programs from cassette tape. But that was an expensive add-on option with early personal computers. For many of us, if we wanted the computer to do anything, we had to type in entire programs from books like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games">101 Basic Computer Games</a>, by hand... <a href="https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=2">like so</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Updating The Single Most Influential Book of the BASIC Era" class="kg-image" height="1049" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-257.png" width="784" /></figure><p>Yep, believe it or not, circa 1983, <em>this was our idea of a good time</em>. No, we didn&apos;t get out much. The book itself was a sort of greatest hits compilation of games collected from Ahl&#x2019;s seminal <a href="https://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n11/66_Dave_tells_Ahl__the_hist.php">Creative Computing Magazine</a> in the 1970s:</p><blockquote>As soon as Ahl made up his mind to leave DEC, he started laying the groundwork for Creative Computing. He announced intentions to publish the magazine at NCC in June 1974 and over the next few months contacted prospective authors, got mailing lists, arranged for typesetting and printing, and started organizing hundreds of other details.<br /><br />In addition, he also moved his family to Morristown, NJ, and settled into his new job at AT&amp;T. He had little spare capital, so he substituted for it with &#x201c;sweat equity.&#x201d; He edited submitted articles and wrote others. He specified type, took photos, got books of &#x201c;clip art,&#x201d; drew illustrations, and laid out boards. He wrote and laid out circulation flyers, pasted on labels, sorted and bundled mailings.<br /><br />By October 1974, when it was time to specify the first print run, he had just 600 subscribers. But Ahl had no intention of running off just 600 issues. He took all the money he had received, divided it in half, and printed 8000 copies with it. These rolled off the presses October 31, 1974. Ahl recounts the feeling of euphoria on the drive to the printer replaced by dismay when he saw two skids of magazines and wondered how he would ever get them off the premises. Three trips later, his basement and garage were filled with 320 bundles of 25 magazines each. He delivered the 600 subscriber copies to the post office the next day, but it took nearly three weeks to paste labels by hand onto the other 7400 copies and send them, unsolicited, to libraries and school systems throughout the country.</blockquote><p>I also <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-of-creative-computing/">loved Creative Computing</a>, but it was a little before my time:</p><ul><li>1971 &#x2013; Ahl ports the programs from FOCAL to BASIC.</li><li>1973 &#x2013; 101 BASIC Computer Games is first published by DEC.</li><li>1974 &#x2013; Ahl founds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Computing_(magazine)">Creative Computing</a> magazine and acquires the rights to the book from DEC.</li><li>1977 &#x2013; the &#x201c;trinity&#x201d; of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a> &#x1f5a5;&#xfe0f;, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">PET </a> &#xfe0f;&#x1f5a5;&#xfe0f;, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">TRS-80 </a> &#x1f5a5;&#xfe0f; microcomputers are released to the public, all with BASIC built in, at prices regular people could mostly afford. &#x1f64c;</li><li>1978 &#x2013; a second edition of BASIC Computer Games is released, this time published by Ahl himself.</li></ul><p>As you can see, there&#x2019;s no way average people in 1973-1976 were doing a whole lot with BASIC programs, as <em>they had no microcomputers capable of running BASIC to buy! </em>It took a while for inexpensive personal computers to trickle down to the mainstream, which brings us to roughly 1984 when the sequels started appearing.</p><p>There was a half-hearted attempt to <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/16765.basic-computer-games-small-basic-edition.aspx">modernize these early BASIC programs</a> in 2010 with SmallBasic, but I didn&#x2019;t feel these ports did much to bring the code up to date, and overall had little relevance to modern code practices.

At one point, <strong>there were more copies of this book in print than there were personal computers, period!</strong></p><blockquote>... in 1973, DEC published an anthology, <em>101 BASIC Computer Games</em>. The book quickly went into a second printing, for a total of 10,000 copies sold. &#x201c;That was far more books than there were computers around, so people were buying three, four, five of them for each computer.&#x201d;</blockquote><p>It went on to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games#Reception">first computer book to sell a million copies</a>. Quite a legacy.</p><p>I think we owe it to the world to bring this book up to date using <strong>modern, memory safe languages that embody the original spirit of BASIC, </strong>and modern programming practices including subroutines.</p><p>So let&#x2019;s do this. <strong>Please </strong><a href="https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games"><strong>join us on GitHub</strong></a>, where we&#x2019;re updating those original 101 BASIC games in 10 memory safe, general purpose scripting languages:</p><ul><li>Java / Kotlin</li><li>Python</li><li>C#</li><li>VB.NET</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>Ruby</li><li>Perl</li><li>Lua</li></ul><p>(Edit: as of March 2022, we&#x2019;ve a) offered Kotlin as an alternative to Java, b) removed Pascal since we can&#x2019;t guarantee memory safety there, and replaced it with Rust, which very much can, and c) added Lua which <em>just</em> cracked the top 20 in TIOBE and strongly meets the scripting and memory safe criteria.)</p><p>Now, bear in mind these are <em>very</em> primitive games from the 1970s. They aren&#x2019;t going to win any awards for gameplay, or programming sophistication. But they <em>are </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_mainframe_games">precious artifacts of early computing</a> that deserve to be preserved for future generations, including the wonderful <a href="http://www.bekerbots.com/botbooks.htm">original art by George Beker</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Updating The Single Most Influential Book of the BASIC Era" class="kg-image" height="318" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/Chomperanimated2.gif" width="300" /></figure><p><strong>We need your help to do this right</strong>, and <em>collaboratively together</em>, as with all modern programming projects.

Use a SFX power supply, which you&#x2019;d expect to do for a mini-ITX build anyway.)</li><li>My primary complaint is that the <strong>power extension cable gets in the way</strong>.

They aren&#x2019;t much more than a battery and an electric motor to begin with. Remember the&#xa0;<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Sebastopol-s-Zap-Power-Systems-is-banking-on-3067718.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappy electric scooter</a>&#xa0;from twenty years ago?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="1435" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-272.png" width="1240" /></figure><p>What killed the electric scooter back then is the same thing that&#xa0;killed the electric car&#xa0;of year 2000: terrible lead-acid battery technology. It&#x2019;s too heavy, it lacks power, it doesn&#x2019;t have enough range, it takes too long to charge. These are all different ways of saying the same thing:&#xa0;<em>the battery sucks</em>. It wasn&#x2019;t until Lithium Ion batteries matured that both the electric car and the electric scooter &#x2013; and pretty much electric&#xa0;<em>everything</em>, if you think about it &#x2013; became viable.</p><p>Thus, one way to see if Lithium Ion battery prices are indeed generally dropping independent of all other manufacturing concerns is to examine the cost of electric scooters over the last few years. Let&#x2019;s consider one of the most popular models, the Xiaomi Mi M365:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="459" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-273.png" width="766" /></figure><p>This graph only shows roughly two years, from January 2018 to now; it looks like the original price for the Xiaomi M365 when it hit the US market in early 2017 was around $800. So&#xa0;<strong>the price of a popular, common electric scooter has&#xa0;<em>halved</em>&#xa0;in three years.</strong>&#xa0;Very good news indeed for electric vehicles of all types!</p><p>This dramatic drop in electric scooter price from 2016 to 2019 may not be surprising versus the parallel rise of the quasi-legal electric scooter smartphone app rental industry over roughly the same time period, in the form of Bird, Lime, Skip, Spin, Scoot, etc.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="800" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-274.png" width="1200" /></figure><p>Early versions of Bird scooters were&#xa0;<em>actual Xiaomi M365s</em>, slightly modified for rental. Only by late 2018 had they&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_(company)#Vehicles" rel="noreferrer">migrated to</a>&#xa0;custom built, ruggedized scooters optimized for the rental market. The rental industries&#xa0;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bird-scooters-money-profit-strategy-20190505-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">have their own challenges</a>, and ironically have started to pivot to monthly rentals rather than the classic 15 cents per minute.</p><blockquote>Bird has experimented with its business model in recent months. In early March, the company altered its repair program in Los Angeles, which had relied on gig workers to fix broken scooters. It moved repairs in-house (though scooters are still charged each night by an army of gig workers). Later that month, the company introduced scooters with locks in some markets, in a bid to prevent theft and vandalism.<br /><br />In April, it announced the launch of a more traditional rental program in San Francisco and Barcelona, in which users could pay $25 per month to rent a Xiaomi m365 from the company rather than paying per ride.</blockquote><p>But this isn&#x2019;t meant to be a blog entry about the viability of scooter rental company business models.</p><p>I want to tackle a more fundamental question:&#xa0;<strong>are electric scooters the future of transportation?</strong></p><p>Even Uber, as screwed up of a company as they still are, knows cars are overkill for a lot of basic transportation needs:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="844" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/09/image-6.png" width="806" /></figure><p>We have plenty of scooters here at my house, and the family and I enjoy them greatly, but I have never actually ridden or owned an electric scooter. So I bought one. It is of course the popular, inexpensive, and well reviewed&#xa0;Xiaomi Mi M365.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="2048" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-276.png" width="2000" /></figure><p>Here&#x2019;s a picture of my electric scooter inside&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/electric-geek-transportation-systems/">my electric car</a>. (I apologize that I didn&#x2019;t have an electric bicycle to park next to it for maximum smugness, but you can&#xa0;<em>bet your sweet electrons</em>&#xa0;I&#x2019;ll work on that next!)</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="1500" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-277.png" width="2000" /></figure><p>The short version of my review is&#xa0;<strong>this electric scooter is incredibly fun, works great, and if you can get it for a price around $300, practically a no-brainer.</strong>&#xa0;I love it, my kids love it, and as long as you&#x2019;re&#xa0;<a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/11/2/18053650/elon-musk-electric-scooters-dignity-recode-swisher" rel="noopener noreferrer">conceptually OK with the look</a>, unlike Elon Musk,&#xa0;&#x1f6f4;&#x1f4a8; then you&#x2019;ll probably love it too.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>I found a neat video covering the &#x201c;one year later&#x201d; experience of owning the scooter, and what you might eventually run into or want to tweak.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>(The main thing to take away from this video is that flats&#xa0;<em>super suck</em>&#xa0;on tires this small, so be warned. I put Slime in my Mi&#x2019;s tires out of an abundance of caution, but you could also go with solid tubeless tires &#x2013; at the cost of some ride comfort &#x2013; if you&#x2019;re really worried.)</p><p>That&#x2019;s not to say that the electric scooter experience is perfect. There are some challenges with electric scooters, starting with the biggest one:&#xa0;your local government has <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/are-electric-scooters-legal-know-the-law-where-you-live" rel="noreferrer">no idea how to regulate the darn things</a>.</p><ul><li>Is this regulated like a bicycle? If not, why not?</li><li>Are they allowed on the sidewalk?</li><li>Do you have to ride them in the road, with cars&#x2026; uh, depending on the speed limit?</li><li>Do you need a driver&#x2019;s license?</li><li>Do you need a helmet?</li><li>Are you even&#xa0;<em>allowed</em>&#xa0;to legally ride them in public at all outside of private property?</li></ul><p>The answers also vary wildly depending on where you live, and with no consistency or apparent logic. Here are&#xa0;the current <a href="https://bayareabicyclelaw.com/new-e-scooter-laws-2019/" rel="noopener noreferrer">electric scooter laws in California</a>, for what it&#x2019;s worth, which&#xa0;<em>require the rider to have a valid driver&#x2019;s license</em>&#xa0;(unlike electric bicycles) and also disallow them from sidewalks, both of which I feel are onerous and unnecessary restrictions.</p><p>One aspect of those laws I&#xa0;<em>definitely</em>&#xa0;agree with, however, is the&#xa0;<strong>15 mile per hour speed restriction</strong>. That&#x2019;s a plenty brisk top speed for a standing adult with no special safety equipment. Anything faster starts to get decidedly&#x2026; uncomfortable. Consider this monster of a&#xa0;<a href="https://www.ewheels.com/product/new-turbowheel-lightning-957wh-battery-2x-1000w-3600w-motors/" rel="noopener noreferrer">1165KWh electric scooter</a>, with dual motors and dual suspension that goes up to&#xa0;<em>forty freakin&#x2019; miles per hour</em>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>That&#x2026; is&#x2026; terrifying. Even the reviewer, in full motorcycle safety gear, wasn&#x2019;t willing to push it all the way to 40 MPH. And I don&#x2019;t blame him! But now that I&#x2019;ve shown you the undisputed Honda Civic everyman budget model of electric scooter in the M365, hopefully this gives you a taste of the wider emerging diversity in these kinds of minimalistic electric vehicles. If you want a&#xa0;<a href="https://www.unagiscooters.com/products/the-scooter?variant=15012683448435" rel="noopener noreferrer">luxury electric scooter</a>, an&#xa0;<a href="https://fluidfreeride.com/products/mosquito-lightweight-foldable-electric-scooter" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultralight electric scooter</a>, a&#xa0;<a href="https://electrek.co/2019/06/10/widewheel-electric-scooter-off-road-test/" rel="noopener noreferrer">rugged offroad electric scooter</a>&#x2026; all things are possible, for a price.</p><p>Another reason the M365 is available for so cheap is that is successor, the&#xa0;Xiaomi M365 Pro, was recently released, although it is not quite possible to obtain in the US at the moment.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>Having ridden my M365 a fair bit, I can confirm all the Pro improvements are welcome, if incremental: bigger battery and disc brake, more power, better display, improved latch mechanism, etc.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Rise of the Electric Scooter" class="kg-image" height="1070" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-278.png" width="1787" /></figure><p>None of those Pro improvements, however, are worth a 2&#xd7; increase in price so I&#x2019;d recommend sticking with the M365 for now because its value proposition is off the charts. Did I mention there&#x2019;s a Bluetooth connection, and an app, and it is possible to&#xa0;hack the M365 firmware? Pretty cool how electric vehicles are inherently digital, isn&#x2019;t it?</p><p>Here are a few other observations after riding my M365 around a fair bit:</p><ul><li><strong>Please be respectful around pedestrians.</strong>&#xa0;Most of the sidewalks around here are not busy at all, but the pedestrians I encountered on the electric scooter were definitely more freaked out than I&#x2019;ve seen before when using regular kick scooters (or skateboards) on the sidewalk, which did surprise me. An electric scooter has more heft to it, both physically at 26 pounds, and in the 15 mile per hour speed it can reach &#x2013; but also mentally in terms of how it looks and how people approach it. I recommend slowing down to just above walking speed when encountering pedestrians, and if there is a bike lane available, I&#x2019;d definitely recommend using that.</li><li><strong>Hills work great.</strong>&#xa0;The kryptonite of traditional kick scooters is hills, and I&#x2019;m pleased to report that even with a&#xa0;cough&#xa0;sizable adult such as myself riding, I was able to sustain a respectable above-walking speed on most <em>reasonable</em> hills. Where I looked at a hill and thought &#x201c;this probably should work,&#x201d; it did. That&#x2019;s impressive, considering this&#xa0;<em>isn&#x2019;t</em>&#xa0;the upgraded Pro model with bigger battery and more powerful motor. On flats and downhills the performance is superb, as you&#x2019;d expect. That said, if you are a really big or tall adult, or live in a particularly hilly area, wait for the Pro model or an equivalent.</li><li><strong>Portability is good, but borderline.</strong>&#xa0;At ~26 pounds, the electric scooter is reasonably portable, but it&#x2019;s not something you a) could really get away with taking inside a restaurant / store with you to prevent theft or b) want to be carrying around on your person for any significant length of time. It&#x2019;s not nearly as nimble or portable as a kick scooter, but that&#x2019;s a high bar. You&#x2019;ll need to carry a bike lock and think about how to lock your scooter on bike racks, which turned out to be&#x2026; more geometrically challenging than I anticipated due to the small tires, disc brakes, and the engine in the front wheel. They need more obvious locking points on the chassis.</li></ul><p>To be honest with you I&#x2019;m still bitter about the whole&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_Inc." rel="noopener noreferrer">Segway</a>&#xa0;debacle. There was so much hype back in the day. That ridiculous thing was&#xa0;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1203segway-unveiled/" rel="noopener noreferrer">supposed to change the world</a>.

Here in 2019, cheap $200 to $300 electric scooters are basically the transformational technology the Segway was&#xa0;<em>supposed</em>&#xa0;to be, aren&#x2019;t they? Are electric scooters the future of (most) transportation? I&#x2019;m not sure, but I do like where we&#x2019;re headed, even if it took us twenty years to get there.</p>'}]}

You take for granted how dirty and noisy gas based cars are in daily operation &#x2013; the engine noise, the exhaust fumes, the brake dust on the rims, the oily residues and thin black film that descends on everything, the way you have to wash your hands every time you use the gas station pumps. You don&#x2019;t fully appreciate how oppressive those little dirty details were until they&#x2019;re gone.</li><li>Electric cars are (almost) completely silent. I guess technically in 2019 electric cars require artificial soundmakers at low speed for safety, and this car has one. But The Oatmeal was right. Electric cars&#xa0;<em>feel</em>&#xa0;like spacecraft because they move so effortlessly. There&#x2019;s virtually no delay from action to reaction, near immediate acceleration and deceleration&#x2026; with almost no sound or vibration at all, like you&#x2019;re in freakin&#x2019; space! It&#x2019;s so immensely satisfying!</li><li>Electric cars aren&#x2019;t just&#xa0;<em>electric</em>, they&#x2019;re utterly digital to their very core. Gas cars always felt like the classic 1950s Pixar Cars world of grease monkeys and machine shop guys, maybe with a few digital bobbins added here and there as an afterthought. This electric car, on the other hand, is squarely in the post-iPhone world of everyday digital gadgets. It feels more like a giant smartphone than a car. I am a programmer, I&#x2019;m a digital guy, I love digital stuff. And electric cars are part of&#xa0;<em>my</em>&#xa0;world, rather than the other way around. It feels good.</li><li>Electric cars are mechanically much simpler than gasoline cars, which means they are inherently more reliable and cheaper to maintain. An internal combustion engine has hundreds of moving parts, many of which require regular maintenance, fluids, filters, and tune ups. It also has a complex transmission to translate the narrow power band of a gas powered engine. None of this is necessary on an electric vehicle, whose electric motor is basically one moving part with simple 100% direct drive from the motor to the wheels. This newfound simplicity is deeply appealing to a guy who always saw cars as incredibly complicated (but computers, not so much).</li><li>Being able to charge at home overnight is perhaps the most radical transformation of all. Your house is now a &#x201c;gas station.&#x201d; Our Kia Niro has a range of about&#xa0;<strong>250 miles</strong>&#xa0;on a full battery. With any modern electric car, provided you drive less than 200 miles a day round trip (who even drives this much?), it&#x2019;s very unlikely you&#x2019;ll ever need to &#x201c;fill the tank&#x201d; anywhere but at home. Ever. It&#x2019;s so strange to think that in 50 years, <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/As-EVs-threaten-gas-stations-owners-turn-to-14291843.php" rel="noreferrer">gas stations&#xa0;may eventually be as odd</a> to see in public as public telephone booths now are. Our charger is, conveniently enough, right next to the driveway since that&#x2019;s where the power breaker box was. With the level 2 charger installed, it literally&#xa0;<em>looks</em>&#xa0;like a gas pump on the side of the house, except this one &#x201c;pumps&#x201d;&#x2026; electrons.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Electric Geek Transportation Systems" class="kg-image" height="2667" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/level-2-ev-charger.jpg" width="2000" /></figure><p>This electric car is such a great experience. It&#x2019;s so much better than our gas powered station wagon that I swear, if there was a fully electric minivan (there isn&#x2019;t) I would literally sell our Honda minivan&#xa0;<em>tomorrow</em>&#xa0;and switch over. Without question. And believe me, I had no plans to sell that vehicle two months ago. The electric car is&#xa0;<em>that much better</em>.</p><p>I was expecting &#x201c;yet another car,&#x201d; but what I got instead was a new, radical worldview. Driving a car powered by barely controlled liquid fuel detonations used to be normal. But in an world of more and more viable electric vehicles this status quo increasingly starts to feel&#x2026; deeply unnatural. Electric is so much better of an overall experience that you begin to wonder: why did we&#xa0;<em>ever</em>&#xa0;do it that way?</p><p>Gas cars seem, for lack of a better word,&#xa0;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/" rel="noreferrer"><em>obsolete</em></a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/"><img alt="Electric Geek Transportation Systems" class="kg-image" height="533" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/ev-sales.jpg" width="740" /></a></figure><p>How did this transformation happen, from my perspective, so suddenly? When exactly did electric cars go from &#x201c;expensive, experimental thing for crazy people&#x201d; to &#x201c;By God, I&#x2019;ll never buy another old fashioned gasoline based car if I can help it&#x201d;?</p><p>I was vaguely aware of the early electric cars. I even remember one coworker circa 2001 who owned a bright neon green Honda Insight. I ignored it all because, like I said,&#xa0;<em>I&#x2019;m not a car guy</em>. I needed to do the research to understand the history, and I started with the often recommended documentary,&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F" rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Killed the Electric Car?</a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>This is mostly about the original highly experimental&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Motors EV1</a>&#xa0;from 1996 to 1999. It&#x2019;s so early the first models had lead-acid batteries! &#x1f631; There&#x2019;s a number of conspiracy theories floated in the video, but I think the simple answer to the implied question in the title is straight up&#xa0;<em>price</em>. The battery tech was nowhere near ready, and per the Wikipedia article the estimated actual cost of the car was somewhere between $100,000 and $250,000 though I suspect it was much closer to the latter. It is interesting to note how much the owners (well, leasers) loved their EV1s. Having gone through that same conversion myself, I empathize!</p><p>I then watched the sequel,&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Electric_Car" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revenge of the Electric Car</a>. This one is essential, because it covers the dawn of the modern electric car we have today.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>This chronicles the creation of three very influential early electric cars &#x2013; the&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nissan Leaf</a>, the&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chevy Volt</a>, and of course the&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(2008)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesla Roadster</a>&#xa0;from 2005 - 2008. The precise moment that Lithium-Ion batteries were in play &#x2013; that&#x2019;s when electric cars started to become viable. Every one of these three electric cars was well conceived and made it to market in volume, though not without significant challenges, both internal and external. None of them were perfect electric vehicles by any means: the Roadster was $100k, the Leaf had limited range, and the Volt was still technically a hybrid, albeit only using the gasoline engine to charge the battery.</p><p>Ten years later, Tesla has the model 3 at $38,000 and we bought our Kia Niro for about the same price. After national and state tax incentives and rebates, that puts the price at around $30,000. It&#x2019;s not as cheap as it needs to be&#x2026; yet. But it&#x2019;s getting there. And it&#x2019;s&#xa0;already <a href="https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/clean-technology/faceoff-electric-vs-gas-cars-on-cost-15555966/" rel="noopener noreferrer">competitive with gasoline vehicles</a> in 2019.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="Electric Geek Transportation Systems" class="kg-image" height="1126" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/2019-civic-vs-leaf-1.jpg" width="1067" /></figure><p>It&#x2019;s still early, but the trend lines are clear. And I&#x2019;m here to tell you that right now, today, I&#x2019;d buy&#xa0;<em>any</em>&#xa0;modern electric car over a gasoline powered car.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>If you too are intrigued by the idea of owning an electric car,&#xa0;<em>you should be</em>. It&#x2019;s freaking awesome! Bring your skepticism, as always; I highly recommend the above Matt Ferrell explainer video on electric vehicle myths.</p><p>As for me, I have seen the future, and it is absolutely, inexorably, and unavoidably&#x2026; electric.&#x26a1;</p>'}]}

The best summary is Maciej Ceg&#x142;owski&#x2019;s,&#xa0;<a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Website Obesity Crisis</a>:</p><blockquote>To channel a famous motivational speaker, I could go out there tonight, with the materials you&#x2019;ve got, and rewrite the sites I showed you at the start of this talk to make them load in under a second. In two hours.<br /><br />Can you? Can you?<br /><br />Of course you can! It&#x2019;s not hard! We knew how to make small websites in 2002. It&#x2019;s not like the secret has been lost to history, like Greek fire or Damascus steel.<br /><br />But we face pressure to make these sites bloated.<br /><br />I bet if you went to a client and presented a 200 kilobyte site template, you&#x2019;d be fired. Even if it looked great and somehow included all the tracking and ads and social media crap they insisted on putting in. It&#x2019;s just so far out of the realm of the imaginable at this point.</blockquote><p>The&#xa0;whole article is essential; you should stop what you&#x2019;re doing and read it now if you haven&#x2019;t already. But if you don&#x2019;t have time, here&#x2019;s the key point:</p><blockquote>This is a screenshot from an NPR article discussing the rising use of ad blockers. The page is 12 megabytes in size in a stock web browser.&#xa0;<strong>The same article with basic ad blocking turned on is 1 megabyte.</strong></blockquote><p>That&#x2019;s right, through the simple act of running an ad blocker, you&#x2019;ve reduced that website&#x2019;s payload by twelve times. Twelve! That&#x2019;s like the most effective exercise program&#xa0;<em>ever!</em></p><p>Even the traditional advice to&#xa0;keep websites lean and mean for mobile&#xa0;no longer applies because new mobile devices, at least on the Apple side, are&#xa0;<em>faster than most existing desktops and laptops.</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="An Exercise Program for the Fat Web" class="kg-image" height="832" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/09/image-5.png" width="803" /></figure><p>Despite&#xa0;<a href="https://danluu.com/web-bloat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">claims to the contrary</a>, the bad guy isn&#x2019;t web bloat, per se.&#xa0;<strong>The bad guy is&#xa0;<em>advertising</em></strong>.

There&#x2019;s a&#xa0;<em>reason</em>&#xa0;the most popular browser plugins are inevitably ad blockers, isn&#x2019;t there? Just ask Google:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="An Exercise Program for the Fat Web" class="kg-image" height="458" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-263.png" width="1151" /></figure><p>So it&#x2019;s all the more surprising to learn that Google is suddenly <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/29/chrome-ad-blocking-enterprise-manifest-v3/" rel="noopener noreferrer">clamping down hard on adblockers</a> in Chrome. Here&#x2019;s what the author of uBlock Origin, an ad blocking plugin for Chrome,&#xa0;<a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/338#issuecomment-496009417" rel="noopener noreferrer">has to say</a>&#xa0;about today&#x2019;s announcement:</p><blockquote>In order for Google Chrome to reach its current user base, it had to support content blockers &#x2013; these are the top most popular extensions for any browser. Google strategy has been to find the optimal point between the two goals of growing the user base of Google Chrome and preventing content blockers from harming its business.<br /><br />The blocking ability of the webRequest API caused Google to yield control of content blocking to content blockers. Now that Google Chrome is the dominant browser, it is in a better position to shift the optimal point between the two goals which benefits Google&#x2019;s primary business.<br /><br />The deprecation of the blocking ability of the webRequest API is to gain back this control, and to further instrument and report how web pages are filtered, since the exact filters which are applied to web pages are useful information which will be collectable by Google Chrome.</blockquote><p>The ad blockers themselves are arguably just as complicit. Eye/o GmbH owns&#xa0;<a href="https://adblockplus.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdBlock</a>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<a href="https://www.ublock.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">uBlock</a>, employs 150 people, and in 2016 they had 50 million euros in revenue, of which about 50% was profit.

Given the plateauing of CPU speeds, I think five years of useful life for these boxes is realistic, but let&#x2019;s assume a conservative three year lifespan to be safe.</p><ul><li>$880 mini-pc 32GB RAM, 6 CPUs, 500GB SSD</li><li>$120 taxes / shipping / misc</li><li>$29 &#xd7; 12 &#xd7; 3 = $1,044</li></ul><p>That&#x2019;s&#xa0;<strong>$2,044 for three years of hosting</strong>. How can we do on Digital Ocean? Per&#xa0;<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">their current pricing page</a>:</p><ul><li>32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs, 640GB SSD</li><li>$160/month</li><li>$160 &#xd7; 12 &#xd7; 3 =&#xa0;<strong>$5,760</strong></li></ul><p>This isn&#x2019;t&#xa0;<em>quite</em>&#xa0;apples to apples, as we are getting an extra 140GB of disk and 2 bonus CPUs, but those CPUs are both slower and partially consumed by multi-tenancy compared to our brand new dedicated, isolated CPUs. (I was curious about this, so I just spun up a new $160/month DO instance for a quick test. The&#xa0;<code>sysbench</code>&#xa0;results are 4086 and 11760 respectively, considerably below the 2019 Mini-PC results, above.) As you can see,&#xa0;<strong>you pay almost three times as much for a cloud server.</strong>&#xa0;&#x1f911;</p><p>I&#x2019;m not saying this is for everyone. If you just need to spin up a quick server or two for testing and experimentation, there&#x2019;s absolutely no way you need to go to the trouble and up-front cost of building and then racking colocated mini-pcs. There&#x2019;s no denying that spinning servers up in the cloud offers unparalleled flexibility and redundancy. But if you do have need for&#xa0;<strong>dedicated computing resources over a period of years</strong>, then building your own small personal cloud, with machines <em>you actually own</em>, is not only one third the cost but also&#x2026; kinda cool?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="The Cloud Is Just Someone Else&#x2019;s Computer" class="kg-image" height="1592" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/02/your-own-personal-cloud.jpg" width="1200" /></figure><p>If you&#x2019;d also like to embark upon this project, you can get the same Partaker B18 box I did for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Partaker-Coffee-Graphics-Barebone-System/dp/B07L4KJXWL" rel="noreferrer">$490 from Amazon</a>, or&#xa0;$460 direct from China via AliExpress.

It&#x2019;s just a little something I like to do, you know...&#xa0;<em>for me</em>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="962" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-27.png" width="960" /></figure><p>Thus, what I&#x2019;d like to do right now is peer into that glorious abyss for a bit and introspect about&#xa0;<strong>the challenges I see facing Stack Overflow for the next 10 years.</strong>&#xa0;Before I begin, I do want to be absolutely crystal clear about a few things:</p><ol><li>I <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/farewell-stack-exchange/" rel="noreferrer">have not worked at Stack Overflow</a> in any capacity whatsoever&#xa0;since February 2012&#xa0;and I&#x2019;ve had zero day-to-day operational input since that date, more or less by choice. Do I have opinions about how things should be done? Uh, have you&#xa0;<em>met me?</em>&#xa0;Do I email people every now and then about said opinions? I might, but I honestly do try to keep it to an absolute minimum, and I think my email archive track record here is reasonable.</li><li>The people working at Stack are amazing and most of them (including much of the Stack Overflow community, while I&#x2019;m at it) could articulate the mission better &#x2014; and perhaps a tad less crankily &#x2014; than I could by the time I left. Would I trust them with my life? No. But I&#x2019;d trust them with Joel&#x2019;s life!</li><li>The whole point of the Stack Overflow exercise is that it&#x2019;s not beholden to me, or Joel, or&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory" rel="noopener noreferrer">any other Great Person</a>. Stack Overflow works because it empowers regular everyday programmers all over the world, just like you, just like me. I guess in my mind it&#x2019;s akin to being a parent. The goal is for your children to eventually grow up to be sane, practicing adults who don&#x2019;t need (or, really,&#xa0;<em>want</em>) you to hang around any more.</li><li>Understand that you&#x2019;re reading&#xa0;<s>the weak opinions strongly held</s>&#xa0;the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">strong opinions weakly held</a>&#xa0;of a co-founder who spent prodigious amounts of time working with the community in the first four years of Stack Overflow&#x2019;s life to shape the rules and norms of the site to fit their needs. These are merely my opinions. I like to think they are&#xa0;<em>informed</em>&#xa0;opinions, but that doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean I can predict the future, or that I am even qualified to try. But I&#x2019;ve never let being &#x201c;qualified&#x201d; stop me from doing anything, and I ain&#x2019;t about to start tonight.</li></ol><h3 id="stack-overflow-is-a-wiki-first">Stack Overflow is a wiki first</h3><p>Stack Overflow ultimately has&#xa0;<em>much</em>&#xa0;more in common with Wikipedia than a discussion forum. By this I mean questions and answers on Stack Overflow are not primarily judged by their usefulness to a specific individual, but by&#xa0;<strong>how many <em>other</em>&#xa0;programmers that question or answer can potentially help over time</strong>. I tried as hard as I could to emphasize this relationship from&#xa0;launch day in 2008. Note who has top billing in this Venn diagram.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="431" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stack-overflow-venn-diagram.png" width="440" /></figure><p>Stack Overflow later added a super neat feature to highlight this core value in user profiles, where it shows how many other people you have potentially helped with your contributed questions and answers so far.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="368" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stackoverflow-people-reached-profile-stat-1.png" width="431" /></figure><p>The most common complaints I see about Stack Overflow are usually the result of this fundamental misunderstanding about who the questions and answers on the site are ultimately&#xa0;<em>for</em>, and why there&#x2019;s so much strictness involved in the whole process.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="398" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/09/image-4.png" width="1090" /></figure><p>I&#x2019;m continually amazed at the number of people, even on Hacker News today, who don&#x2019;t realize that every single question and answer is editable on Stack Overflow, even as a completely anonymous user who isn&#x2019;t logged in. Which makes sense, right,&#xa0;<em>because Stack Overflow is a wiki</em>, and that&#x2019;s how wikis work. Anyone can edit them. Go ahead, try it right now if you don&#x2019;t believe me &#x2013; press the &#x201c;improve this answer&#x201d; or &#x201c;improve this question&#x201d; button on anything that can be improved, and make it so.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="323" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stack-overflow-edit-question.png" width="861" /></figure><p>The responsibility for this misunderstanding is all on Stack Overflow (and by that I also mean myself, at least up until 2012). I guess the logic is that &#x201c;every programmer has surely seen, used, and understands Stack Overflow by now, 10 years in&#x201d; but... I think that&#x2019;s a risky assumption. New programmers are minted every second of every day. Complicating matters further, there are three tiers of usage at Stack Overflow, from biggest to smallest, in inverted pyramid style:</p><ol><li><strong>I passively search for programming answers. </strong>Passively searching and reading highly ranked Stack Overflow answers as they appear in web search results is arguably the&#xa0;<em>primary goal of Stack Overflow</em>. If Stack Overflow is working like it&#x2019;s supposed to, 98% of programmers should get all the answers they need from reading search result pages and wouldn&#x2019;t need to ask or answer a single question in their entire careers. This is a good thing! Great, even!</li><li><strong>I participate on Stack Overflow when I get stuck on a really hairy problem and searching isn&#x2019;t helping. </strong>Participating only at those times when you are extra stuck is completely valid. However, I feel this level is where most people tend to run into difficulty on Stack Overflow, because it involves someone who may not be new to Stack Overflow per se, but is new to asking questions, and also at the precise time of stress and tension for them where they&#xa0;<em>must</em>&#xa0;get an answer due to a problem they&#x2019;re facing&#x2026; and they don&#x2019;t have the time or inclination to deal with Stack Overflow&#x2019;s strict wiki type requirements for research effort, formatting, showing previous work, and referencing what they found in prior searches.</li><li><strong>I participate on Stack Overflow for professional development. </strong>At this level you&#x2019;re talking about experienced Stack Overflow users who have contributed many answers and thus have a pretty good idea of what makes a great question, the kind they&#x2019;d want to answer themselves. As a result, they don&#x2019;t tend to ask many questions because they self-medicate through exhaustive searching and research, but when they do ask one, their questions are exemplary.</li></ol><p>(There&#x2019;s technically a fourth tier here, for people who want to selflessly contribute creative commons questions and answers to move the entire field of software development forward for the next generation of software developers. But who has time for saints &#x1f607;, y&#x2019;all make the rest of us look bad, so knock it off already, Skeet.)</p><p>It wouldn&#x2019;t shock me at all if people spent&#xa0;<em>years</em>&#xa0;happily at tier 1 and then got a big unpleasant surprise when reaching tier 2. The primary place to deal with this, in my opinion, is a&#xa0;<strong>massively revamped and improved ask page</strong>. It&#x2019;s also fair to note that maybe people don&#x2019;t understand that they&#x2019;re signing up for a sizable chunk of work by implicitly committing to the wiki standard of &#x201c;try to make sure it&#x2019;s useful to more people than just yourself&#x201d; when asking a question on Stack Overflow, and are then put off by the negative reaction to what others view as an insufficiently researched question.</p><p>Stack Overflow absorbs so much tension from its adoption of wiki standards for content. Even if you know about that requirement up front, it is not always clear what &#x201c;useful&#x201d; means, in the same way it&#x2019;s not always clear what topics, people, and places are deserving of a Wikipedia page.&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrietta Lacks</a>, absolutely, but what about your cousin Dave in Omaha with his weirdo PHP 5.6 issue?</p><h3 id="over-time-duplicates-become-vast-landmine-fields">Over time, duplicates become vast landmine fields</h3><p>Here&#x2019;s one thing&#xa0;I really, really saw coming&#xa0;and to be honest with you I was kinda glad I left in 2012 before I had to deal with it because of the incredible technical difficulty involved:&#xa0;<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/04/29/handling-duplicate-questions/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>duplicates</strong></a>. Of all the complaints I hear about Stack Overflow, this is the one I am most sympathetic to by far.</p><p>If you accept that Stack Overflow is a wiki type system, then for the same reasons that you obviously can&#x2019;t have five different articles about Italy on Wikipedia,&#xa0;<strong>Stack Overflow can&#x2019;t allow duplicate questions on the exact same programming problem</strong>. While there is a fair amount of code to do pre-emptive searches as people type in questions, plus&#xa0;<em>many</em>&#xa0;exhortations to search before you ask, with an inviting search field and button right there on the mandatory page you see before asking your first question...</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="539" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-29.png" width="1313" /></figure><p>...locating and identifying duplicate content is an insanely difficult problem even for a company like Google that&#x2019;s done nothing but specialize in this exact problem for, what, 20 years now, with a veritable army of the world&#x2019;s most talented engineers.</p><p>When you&#x2019;re asking a question on a site that doesn&#x2019;t allow duplicate questions, the problem space of a site with 1 million existing questions is rather different from a site with 10 million existing questions... or 100 million. Asking a single unique question goes from mildly difficult to mission almost impossible, because your question needs to thread a narrow path through this vast, enormous field of prior art questions without stepping on any of the vaguely similar looking landmines in the process.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="532" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stackoverflow-asking-duplicate-question.png" width="941" /></figure><p>But wait!&#xa0;<em>It gets harder!</em></p><ul><li>Some <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/16/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/" rel="noopener noreferrer">variance in similar-ish questions</a> is OK, because 10 different people will ask a nearly identical question using 10 different sets of completely unrelated words with no overlap. I know, it sounds crazy, but trust me: humans are amazing at this. We want all those duplicates to exist so they can&#xa0;<em>point to</em>&#xa0;the primary question they are a duplicate of, while still being valid search targets for people who ask questions with unusual or rare word choices.</li><li>It can be legitimately difficult to determine if your question is a true duplicate. How much overlap is enough before one programming question is a duplicate of another? And by whose definition? Opinions vary. This is subject to human interpretation, and humans are.. unreliable. Nobody will ever be completely happy with this system, pretty much by design. That tension is baked in permanently and forever.</li></ul><p>I don&#x2019;t have any real answers on the duplicate problem, which only gets worse over time. But I will point out that there is plenty of precedent&#xa0;on <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites#traffic" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Stack Exchange network</a>&#xa0;for splitting sites into &#x201c;expert&#x201d; and &#x201c;beginner&#x201d; areas with slightly different rulesets. We&#x2019;ve seen this for Math vs. MathOverflow, English vs. English Learners, Unix vs. Ubuntu...&#xa0;<strong>perhaps it&#x2019;s time for a more beginner focused Stack Overflow</strong>&#xa0;where duplicates are less frowned upon, and conversational rules are a bit more lenient?</p><h3 id="stack-overflow-is-a-competitive-system-of-peer-review">Stack Overflow is a competitive system of peer review</h3><p>Stack Overflow was indeed built to be a fairly explicitly competitive system, with the caveat that&#xa0;&#x201c;there&#x2019;s <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt" rel="noopener noreferrer">always more than one way</a>&#xa0;to do it.&#x201d; This design choice was based on my perennial observation that the best way to motivate any programmer... is to subtly insinuate that&#xa0;<em>another</em>&#xa0;programmer could have maybe done it better.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="572" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-30.png" width="1462" /></figure><p>This is manifested in the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/for-a-bit-of-colored-ribbon/" rel="noreferrer">public reputation</a> system on Stack Overflow, the incredible power of a number printed next to someone&#x2019;s name, writ large. All reputation in Stack Overflow comes from the recognition of your peers, never the &#x201c;system.&#x201d;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="741" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stack-overflow-top-rep-by-year.png" width="1564" /></figure><p>Once your question is asked, or your answer is posted, it can then be poked, prodded, edited, flagged, closed, opened, upvoted, downvoted,&#xa0;<a href="http://www.cs.mun.ca/~harold/Courses/Old/CS1400.W15/Diary/Lubar1992.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">folded and spindled</a>&#xa0;by your peers. The&#xa0;<em>intent</em>&#xa0;is for Stack Overflow to be a system of peer review and friendly competition, like a code review from a coworker you&#x2019;ve never met at a different division of the company. It&#x2019;s also completely fair for a fellow programmer to question the premise of your question, as long as it&#x2019;s done in a nice way. For example,&#xa0;do you really want to use that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags" rel="noopener noreferrer">regular expression to match HTML</a>?</p><p>I fully acknowledge that&#xa0;<strong>competitive peer review systems aren&#x2019;t for everyone</strong>, and thus the overall process of having peers review your question may not always feel great, depending on your circumstances and background in the field &#x2013;&#xa0;<em>particularly</em>&#xa0;when combined with the substantial tensions around utility and duplicates Stack Overflow already absorbed from its wiki elements. Kind of a double whammy there.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve heard people describe the process of asking a question on Stack Overflow as anxiety inducing. To me, posting on Stack Overflow is&#xa0;<em>supposed</em>&#xa0;to involve a healthy kind of minor &#x201c;let me be sure to show off my best work&#x201d; anxiety:</p><ul><li>the anxiety of giving a presentation to your fellow peers</li><li>the anxiety of doing well on a test</li><li>the anxiety of showing up to a new job with talented coworkers you admire</li><li>the anxiety of attending your first day at school with other students at your level</li></ul><p>I imagine systems where there is zero anxiety involved and I can only think of jobs where I had long since stopped caring about the work and thus had no anxiety about whether I even showed for work on any given day. How can that be good? Let&#x2019;s just say I&#x2019;m not a fan of zero-anxiety systems.</p><p>Maybe competition just isn&#x2019;t your jam. Could there be a less competitive Q&amp;A system, a system without downvotes, a system without close votes, where there was never any anxiety about posting anything, just a network of super supportive folks who believe in you and want you to succeed no matter what? Absolutely! I think many alternative sites&#xa0;<em>should</em>&#xa0;exist on the internet so people can choose an experience that matches their personal preferences and goals. Should Stack build that alternative? Has it already been built? It&#x2019;s an open question; feel free to point out examples in the comments.</p><h3 id="stack-overflow-is-designed-for-practicing-programmers">Stack Overflow is designed for practicing programmers</h3><p>Another point of confusion that comes up a fair bit is who the intended audience for Stack Overflow actually is. That one is straightforward, and it&#x2019;s been the same from day one:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="What does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?" class="kg-image" height="557" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/10/stackoverflow-for-business-description.png" width="558" /></figure><p>Q&amp;A for&#xa0;<strong>professional and enthusiast programmers</strong>. By that we mean:</p><blockquote>People who either already have a job as a programmer, or could potentially be hired as a programmer today if they wanted to be.</blockquote><p>Yes, in case you&#x2019;re wondering, part of this was an overt business decision. To make money you must have an audience of people already on a programmer&#x2019;s salary, or in the job hunt to be a programmer. The entire Stack Overflow network may be Creative Commons licensed, but it was never a non-profit play. It was planned as a sustainable business from the outset, and that&#x2019;s why&#xa0;we <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stack-overflow-careers-amplifying-your-awesome/">launched Stack Overflow Careers</a>&#xa0;only one year after Stack Overflow itself... to be honest far sooner than we should have, in retrospect. Careers has since been smartly subsumed into Stack Overflow proper at&#xa0;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs" rel="noopener noreferrer">stackoverflow.com/jobs</a>&#xa0;for a more integrated and most assuredly way-better-than-2009 experience.</p><p>The choice of audience wasn&#x2019;t meant to be an exclusionary decision in any way, but Stack Overflow was definitely designed as a fairly strict system of peer review, which is great (IMNSHO, obviously) for already practicing professionals, but&#xa0;<strong>pretty much everything you would&#xa0;<em>not</em>&#xa0;want as a student or beginner</strong>. This is why I cringe so hard I practically turn myself inside out when people on Twitter mention that they have pointed their students at Stack Overflow. What you&#x2019;d want for a beginner or a student in the field of programming is almost&#xa0;<em>the exact opposite</em>&#xa0;of what Stack Overflow does at every turn:</p><ul><li>one-on-one mentoring</li><li>real time collaborative screen sharing</li><li>live chat</li><li>theory and background courses</li><li>starter tasks and exercises</li><li>playgrounds to experiment in</li></ul><p>These are all very fine and good things, but Stack Overflow does&#xa0;<em>NONE</em>&#xa0;of them, by design.</p><p><em>Can</em>&#xa0;you use Stack Overflow to learn how to program from first principles? Well, technically you can do anything with any software. You could try to have actual conversations on Reddit, if you&#x2019;re a masochist. But the answer is yes. You could learn how to program on Stack Overflow, in theory, if you are a prodigy who is comfortable with the light competitive aspects (reputation, closing, downvoting) and also perfectly willing to define all your contributions to the site in terms of utility to others, not just yourself as a student attempting to learn things. But I&#xa0;<em>suuuuuuper</em>&#xa0;would not recommend it. There are&#xa0;far better websites and systems out there for <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/heres-the-programming-game-you-never-asked-for/">learning to be a programmer</a>.&#xa0;<em>Could</em>&#xa0;Stack Overflow build beginner and student friendly systems like this? I don&#x2019;t know, and it&#x2019;s certainly not my call to make. &#x1f914;</p><p>And that&#x2019;s it. We can now resume our normal non-abyss gazing. Or whatever it is that passes for normal in these times.</p><p>I hope all of this doesn&#x2019;t come across as negative. Overall I&#x2019;d say the state of the Stack is strong. But does it even matter what I think?&#xa0;<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/11/25/stack-overflow-is-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As it was in 2008</a>, so it is in 2018.</p><blockquote><strong>Stack Overflow is&#xa0;<em>you</em>.</strong><br /><br />This is the scary part, the great leap of faith that Stack Overflow is predicated on: trusting your fellow programmers. The programmers who choose to participate in Stack Overflow are the &#x201c;secret sauce&#x201d; that makes it work. You are the reason I continue to believe in developer community as the greatest source of learning and growth. You are the reason I continue to get so many positive emails and testimonials about Stack Overflow. I can&#x2019;t take credit for that. But you can.<br /><br />I learned the collective power of my fellow programmers long ago writing on Coding Horror. The community is far, far smarter than I will ever be. All I can ask &#x2014; all any of us can ask &#x2014; is to help each other along the path.<br /><br />And if your fellow programmers decide to recognize you for that, then I say you&#x2019;ve well and truly earned it.</blockquote><p>The strength of Stack Overflow begins, and ends, with the&#xa0;community of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">programmers that power the site</a>.

But let&#x2019;s consider&#xa0;how this email even got sent to its target in the first place:</p><ul><li>An attacker slurped up lists of any public emails of 2008 political campaign staffers.</li><li>One 2008 staffer was&#xa0;<em>also</em>&#xa0;hired for the 2016 political campaign.</li><li>That particular staffer had non-public campaign emails in their address book, and one of them was a powerful key campaign member with an extensive email history.</li></ul><p>On successful phish leads to an even wider address book attack net down the line. Once they gain access to a person&#x2019;s inbox, they use it to prepare to their next attack. They&#x2019;ll harvest existing email addresses, subject lines, content, and attachments to construct plausible looking boobytrapped emails and mail them to all of&#xa0;<em>their</em>&#xa0;contacts. How sophisticated and targeted to a particular person this effort is determines whether it&#x2019;s so-called &#x201c;spear&#x201d; phishing or not.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="742" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/phishing-vs-spear-phishing.png" width="1972" /></figure><p>In this case is it was not at all targeted. This is a remarkably unsophisticated, absolutely generic routine phishing attack. There is zero focused attack effort on display here. But note the target did&#xa0;<em>not</em>&#xa0;immediately click the link in the email!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="989" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-hack-email-link-1.png" width="1696" /></figure><p>Instead, he did exactly what you&#x2019;d want a person to do in this scenario:&#xa0;<strong>he emailed IT support and asked if this email was valid.</strong>&#xa0;But IT made&#xa0;a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html" rel="noreferrer">fatal mistake in their response</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="610" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-it-support-response.png" width="1212" /></figure><p>Do you see it? Here&#x2019;s the kicker:</p><blockquote>Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said&#xa0;<strong>he had meant to type that it was an &#x201c;illegitimate&#x201d; email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.</strong></blockquote><p>One word. He got&#xa0;<em>one</em>&#xa0;word wrong. But what a word to get wrong, and in the first sentence! The email did provide the proper Google address to reset your password. But the lede was already buried since the first sentence said &#x201c;legitimate;&#x201d; the phishing link in that email was then clicked. And the rest is literally history.</p><p>What&#x2019;s even funnier (well, in the way of gallows humor, I guess) is that public stats were left enabled for that bit.ly tracking link, so you can see exactly what crazy domain that &#x201c;Google login page&#x201d; resolved to, and that it was clicked exactly twice, on the same day it was mailed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="715" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/bitly-podesta-tracking-link.png" width="1120" /></figure><p>As I said, these were not exactly sophisticated attackers. So yeah, in&#xa0;<em>theory</em>&#xa0;an attentive user could pay attention to the browser&#x2019;s address bar and notice that after clicking the link, they arrived at</p><p><code>http://myaccount.google.com-securitysettingpage.tk/security/signinoptions/password</code></p><p>instead of</p><p><code>https://myaccount.google.com/security</code></p><p>Note that the phishing URL is carefully constructed so the most &#x201c;correct&#x201d; part is at the front, and weirdness is sandwiched in the middle. Unless you&#x2019;re paying very close attention and your address bar is long enough to expose the full URL, it&#x2019;s&#x2026; tricky. See this 10 second video for a dramatic example.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular">\n            <div class="kg-video-container">\n                <video height="1080" poster="https://img.spacergif.org/v1/1920x1080/0a/spacer.png" preload="metadata" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/media/2025/02/twitter-phishing-video.mp4" width="1920"></video>\n                <div class="kg-video-overlay">\n                    <button class="kg-video-large-play-icon">\n                        <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n                            <path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z">\n                        </svg>\n                    </button>\n                </div>\n                <div class="kg-video-player-container">\n                    <div class="kg-video-player">\n                        <button class="kg-video-play-icon">\n                            <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n                                <path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class="kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide">\n                            <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n                                <rect height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5" width="7" x="3" y="1">\n                                <rect height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5" width="7" x="14" y="1">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <span class="kg-video-current-time">0:00</span>\n                        <div class="kg-video-time">\n                            /<span class="kg-video-duration">0:10</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <input class="kg-video-seek-slider" max="100" type="range" value="0" />\n                        <button class="kg-video-playback-rate">1&#xd7;</button>\n                        <button class="kg-video-unmute-icon">\n                            <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n                                <path d="M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class="kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide">\n                            <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n                                <path d="M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <input class="kg-video-volume-slider" max="100" type="range" value="100" />\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            \n        </figure><p>(<s>And if you think that one&#x2019;s good, check out&#xa0;this one.</s> Don&#x2019;t forget all the Unicode look-alike trickery you can pull, too.) </p><p>I originally wrote this post as a presentation for the Berkeley Computer Science Club back in March, and at that time I gathered a list of public phishing pages I found on the web.</p><p><code>nightlifesofl.com<br />ehizaza-limited.com<br />tcgoogle.com<br />appsgoogie.com<br />security-facabook.com</code></p><p>Of those five examples from 6 months ago, one is completely gone, one loads just fine, and three present an appropriately scary red interstitial warning page that strongly advises you not to visit the page you&#x2019;re trying to visit, courtesy of Google&#x2019;s&#xa0;<a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">safe browsing API</a>.

A password is what you know; you need to add the second factor of something you&#xa0;<em>have</em>&#xa0;(or something you&#xa0;<em>are</em>) to achieve significant additional security. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/" rel="noreferrer">SMS can famously&#xa0;be intercepted</a>, social engineered, or sim-jacked all too easily. If it&#x2019;s SMS, it&#x2019;s not secure,&#xa0;<em>period</em>. So install an authenticator app, and use it, at least for your most important credentials such as your email account and your bank.</p><p>Have I mentioned that Discourse&#xa0;added <a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2018/05/discourse-2-0-released/" rel="noopener noreferrer">two factor authentication support</a> in version 2.0, and our just released 2.1 adds printed backup codes, too? There are two paths forward: you can&#xa0;<em>talk</em>&#xa0;about the solution, or you can&#xa0;<em>build</em>&#xa0;the solution. I&#x2019;m trying to do both to the best of my ability. Look for the 2FA auth option in your user preferences on your favorite Discourse instance. It&#x2019;s there for you.</p><p>(This is also a company policy at Discourse; if you work here,&#xa0;<em>you 2FA everything all the time</em>. No other login option exists.)</p><p><strong>2) Make all your passwords 11 characters or more.</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/hacker-hack-thyself/">a long story</a>, but anything under 11 characters&#xa0;is basically the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-password-is-too-damn-short/" rel="noreferrer">same as having no password</a> at all&#xa0;these days. I personally recommend at least 14 characters, maybe even 16. But this won&#x2019;t be a problem for you, because...</p><p><strong>3) Use a password manager.</strong></p><p>If you use a password manager, you can simultaneously avoid the pernicious danger of password re-use and&#xa0;the difficulty of coming up with <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/">unique and random passwords</a>&#xa0;all the time. It is my hope in the long run that cloud based password management gets deeply built into Android, iOS, OSX, and Windows so that people don&#x2019;t need to run a weird m&#xe9;lange of third party apps to achieve this essential task. Password management is foundational and should not be the province of third parties on principle, because you never outsource a core competency.</p><p><strong>Bonus rule! For the particularly at-risk, get and use a U2F key.</strong></p><p>In the long term, two factor through an app isn&#x2019;t quite secure enough due to the very real (and growing) specter of real-time phishing. Authentication apps offer timed keys that expire after a minute or two, but if the attacker can get you to type an authentication key and relay it to the target site fast enough, they can still log in as you. If you need ultimate protection,&#xa0;look into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor" rel="noopener noreferrer">U2F keys</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security" class="kg-image" height="720" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/u2f-keys.jpg" width="720" /></figure><p>I believe U2F support is still too immature at the moment, particularly on mobile, for this to be practical for the average person right now. But if you do happen to fall into those groups that will be under attack, you&#xa0;<em>absolutely</em>&#xa0;want to set up U2F keys where you can today. They&#x2019;re cheap, and the good news is that they&#xa0;<em>literally make phishing impossible</em>&#xa0;at last. Given that Google had&#xa0;100% company-wide <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">success against phishing with U2F</a>, we know this works.</p><p>In today&#x2019;s world, computers are now so omnipresent that there is no longer any such thing as cybersecurity, online security, or computer security &#x2013; there&#x2019;s only&#xa0;<em>security</em>. You either have it, or you don&#x2019;t. If you follow and share these three rules, hopefully you too can have a modicum of security today.</p>'}]}

There are absolutely occupational hazards of being a programmer, and&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-favorite-programming-quote/">one of my favorite programming quotes</a>&#xa0;is an allusion to one of them:</p><blockquote>It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a&#xa0;<code>DestroyBaghdad</code>&#xa0;procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a&#xa0;<code>DestroyCity</code>&#xa0;procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.</blockquote><p>Which reminds me of&#xa0;another <a href="https://waxy.org/2015/12/tracking_the_trump_is_a_comment_section_running_for_president_joke/" rel="noopener noreferrer">joke people were telling in 2015</a>:</p><blockquote>Donald Trump is basically a comment section running for president</blockquote><p>Which is troubling because technically,&#xa0;<em>technically</em>, I run a <a href="https://discourse.org/" rel="noreferrer">company that&#xa0;builds comment sections</a>.</p><p>Here at the tail end of 2017, from where I sit neither of these jokes seem particularly funny to me any more.

But&#xa0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Serve_Man_(The_Twilight_Zone)" rel="noopener noreferrer">maybe now we are</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" class="kg-image" height="900" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-33.png" width="1199" /></figure><p>I&#x2019;ve said many, many times that the key to becoming an experienced software developer is to understand that you are, at all times,&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/on-the-meaning-of-coding-horror/">your own worst enemy</a>. I don&#x2019;t mean this in a negative way &#x2013; you have to constantly plan for and design around your inevitable human mistakes and fallibility. It&#x2019;s fundamental to good software engineering because, well, we&#x2019;re all human. The good-slash-bad news is that you&#x2019;re only&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-trap-you-set-for-yourself/"><em>accidentally</em><u>&#xa0;</u>out to get yourself</a>. But what happens when we&#x2019;re infinitely connected and software is suddenly&#xa0;<em>everywhere</em>, in everyone&#x2019;s pockets every moment of the day, starting to approximate a natural extension of our bodies? All of a sudden those little collective social software accidents become <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-other-tech-bubble/" rel="noreferrer">considerably more dangerous</a>:</p><blockquote>The issue is bigger than any single scandal, I told him. As headlines have exposed the troubling inner workings of company after company, startup culture no longer feels like fodder for gentle parodies about ping pong and hoodies. It feels ugly and rotten. Facebook, the greatest startup success story of this era, isn&#x2019;t a merry band of hackers building cutesy tools that allow you to digitally Poke your friends. It&#x2019;s a powerful and potentially sinister collector of personal data, a propaganda partner to government censors, and an enabler of discriminatory advertising.</blockquote><p>I&#x2019;m reminded of a particular Mitchell and Webb skit:&#xa0;&#x201c;<em>Are we the baddies?&#x201d;</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>On the topic of unanticipated downsides to technology, there is no show more essential than&#xa0;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70264888" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Mirror</a>.

These are very real cautionary tales, and some of this stuff is well on its way toward being realized.</p><p>Programmers don&#x2019;t think of themselves as people with the power to change the world. Most programmers I know, including myself, grew up as nerds, geeks, social outcasts. Did I ever tell you about the time I wrote a self-destructing Apple // boot disk program to let a girl in middle school know that I liked her? I was (and still am) a terrible programmer, but oh man did I ever test the heck out of&#xa0;<em>that</em>&#xa0;code before copying on to her school floppy disc. But I digress. What do you do when you wake up one day and software&#xa0;<em>has</em>&#xa0;kind of eaten the world, and&#xa0;<strong>it is no longer clear if software is in fact an unambiguously good thing, like we thought, like everyone told us&#x2026; like we&#xa0;<em>wanted it to be?</em></strong></p><p>Months ago I submitted a brief interview for a&#xa0;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1465462333/" rel="noreferrer">children&#x2019;s book about coding</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" class="kg-image" height="768" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-34.png" width="598" /></figure><p>I recently received a complimentary copy of the book in the mail.

I had no real recollection of the interview questions after the months of lead time it takes to print a physical book, but reading the printed page, I suddenly hit myself over the head with the very answer I had been searching my soul for these past 6 months:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" class="kg-image" height="201" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-35.png" width="655" /></figure><p>In attempting to simplify my answers for an audience of kids, I had concisely articulated the one thing that keeps me coming back to software:&#xa0;<strong>to serve man</strong>. Not on a platter, for bullshit monetization &#x2013; but <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-just-in-time-theory/" rel="noreferrer">software that&#xa0;helps people</a>&#xa0;be the best version of themselves.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure><p>And you know why I do it? I need that help, too. I get tired, angry, upset, emotional, cranky, irritable, frustrated and I need to be reminded from time to time to choose to be the better version of myself. I don&#x2019;t always succeed. But&#xa0;<em>I want to</em>. And I believe everyone else &#x2013; for some reasonable statistical value of everyone else &#x2013; fundamentally does, too.</p><p>That was the not-so-secret design philosophy behind Stack Overflow, that&#xa0;<strong>by helping others become better programmers, you too would become a better programmer</strong>. It&#x2019;s unavoidable. And, even better, if we leave enough helpful breadcrumbs behind for those that follow us,&#xa0;<em>we collectively advance the whole of programming for everyone</em>.</p><p>I apologize for not blogging much in 2017. I&#x2019;ve certainly been busy with Discourse which is actually going great; we grew to 21 people and&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2017/12/discourse-gives-back-2017/" rel="noopener noreferrer">gave $55,000 back</a>&#xa0;this year to the open source ecosystem we build on. But that&#x2019;s no excuse. The truth is that it&#x2019;s been hard to write because this has been a deeply troubling year in so many dimensions &#x2013; for men, for tech, for American democracy. I&#x2019;m ashamed of much that happened, and I think one of the first and most important steps we can take is to&#xa0;<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-hugging-will-continue-until-morale-improves/">embrace explicit codes of conduct</a>&#xa0;throughout our industry. I also continue to believe, if we start to think more holistically about what our software can do to&#xa0;<strong>serve all people</strong>, not just ourselves personally (or, even worse, the company we work for) &#x2013; that software can and should be part of the solution.</p><p>I tried to amplify on these thoughts in recent podcasts:</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<table><tbody style="margin: 0px;"><tr style="margin: 0px;"><td><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" height="100" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/kim-crayton.jpg" style="margin: 0px; display: block; height: auto;" width="100" /></td><td>&#xa0;<a href="http://www.kimcrayton.com/commengreport-jeff-atwood/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Community Engineering Report</a><span>&#xa0;</span>with Kim Crayton</td></tr><tr style="margin: 0px;"><td><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" height="100" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/dave-rael.jpg" style="margin: 0px; display: block; height: auto;" width="100" /></td><td>&#xa0;<a href="http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-258-jeff-atwood-sharing-the-house" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Developer on Fire</a><span>&#xa0;</span>with Dave Rael</td></tr><tr style="margin: 0px;"><td><img alt="To Serve Man, with Software" height="100" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/william-channer.jpg" style="margin: 0px; display: block; height: auto;" width="100" /></td><td>&#xa0;<a href="https://drt.fm/jeff-atwood" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dorm Room Tycoon</a><span>&#xa0;</span>with William Channer</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>Software is easy to change, but people... aren&#x2019;t.

You see, the western ice shelf where the Gree visit nowadays used to be a dedicated PvP area. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JNT33oSXjE" target="_blank">This brief video by Force Gaming</a> should give you an idea of how it was <i>supposed</i> to work. It was released about two weeks after launch, and the video notes that at the time, people were just flipping objectives and not much PvP was going on. This was "fixed" with a patch... that in turn <a href="https://spinksville.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/swtor-the-oops-we-just-broke-high-level-world-pvp-patch/" target="_blank">broke the area in a whole bunch of other ways</a>. The result were crazy AoE fests that the game\'s engine couldn\'t deal with very well, which caused people to gain valour way too fast, even as they were just dying over and over in the mayhem. It was just chaos and caused endless complaints.</p><p>Once again, this is something I didn\'t actually get to experience directly, as I took my time levelling and didn\'t get to Ilum until about three months later, by which time all the craziness had already died down. In January 2013, I actually wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-strangeness-of-ilum-year-later.html">The strangeness of Ilum a year later</a>", but in those first weeks after launch, it was seemingly all people would talk about on forums and news sites, about how this newly launched MMO clearly didn\'t know how to deal with PvP and was therefore already failing horribly.</p><p><b>The original Rakghoul event</b></p><p>The recurring Rakghoul Resurgence event is probably old hat to most of you at this point - just another world event that comes around every so often and which has been around for what feels like forever. The very first Rakghoul event in April 2012 though... that was something else. The activities it came with weren\'t really any more exciting than what we have in the repeating event, but the vibe was very different and unique, mainly because we had no idea it was coming.</p><p>The game was still very new at the time, had a lot going on and we were getting patches and updates about more patches all the time... but this came as a complete surprise, and the experience of everyone being confused about what was going on and slowly figuring things out over the course of the first day was unique and exciting in a way that I think is hard to convey nowadays. You can read <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/world-event.html">the blog post I wrote about it at the time</a> to get an idea though. (I also wrote <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-plague-day-4.html">two</a> <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-event-end.html">follow-ups</a>.)</p><p>Ultimately the fact that it was a time-limited one-off was also one of the biggest criticisms Bioware received, which is why they eventually swapped to making new events recurring. The Rakghouls would eventually join the rotation in <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-rakghouls-are-here.html">early 2014</a>.</p><p><b>The Grand Acquisitions Race</b></p><p>The Grand Acquisitions Race (sometimes also referred to as "the Chevin event") was SWTOR\'s second one-time world event, and a lot less exciting than the original Rakghoul incursion on Tatooine. One reason for this was that <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/world-event-take-2.html">we actually knew that it was coming</a>, even if we didn\'t know the details. The second reason however was that it was simply <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-grand-acquisitions-race-in-review.html">a lot less exciting in terms of activities</a>, as all there was to do was a time-gated puzzle quest chain and farming currency crates on Nar Shaddaa. I have to chuckle a bit when I occasionally see people say that this event should be brought back. People didn\'t even care about it that much when the game was still in its heyday and a limited-time world event was something exciting! Still, I guess my point is you had to be there to know just how underwhelming it really was.</p><p><b>The return of Revan</b></p><p>I think this one might be a bit hard to parse for anyone who started playing after 2014. We all&nbsp;know Revan is in the game, right? There\'s a whole expansion called "Shadow of Revan", no? Well, for a moment, try to imagine that there wasn\'t. Revan is in the game, but only in this weird side quest that you\'ll only see if you like doing group content, and he\'s a prisoner one moment and a genocidal maniac the next, and if you blink you\'ll miss him dying as well. Also note that you had to have levelled through and done group content <i>on both factions</i> to be able to make sense of this brief cameo, something which fans of the original KotOR were not at all happy about.</p><p>Then it\'s 2014 - we\'ve been level 55 for a bit over a year, got several new daily areas and raids, everything\'s kind of chugging along nicely if you\'re not dying for your character\'s personal story to be continued... and then we start getting <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/04/assault-on-tython-and-korriban.html">a new series of flashpoints</a> that\'s being promoted as a new story arc called "Forged Alliances". That Theron guy is kinda cute, but aside from that it\'s all a bit mysterious. Who are these new troublemakers in the shadows? The answer came <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/09/legacy-of-rakata.html">in September</a>, in a post in which I felt the need to give a spoiler warning.</p><p>Whoa, Revan is back? Revan is <i>alive</i>? Is it really him though? And then <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/10/quick-30-announcement-thoughts.html">a whole expansion with his name</a>! It was exciting times for a while, showing once again that Revan\'s name still attracted the crowds. I think reception of the expansion storyline was ultimately a bit mixed - it gave the character a better send-off than the base game had for sure, but it was still a bit awkward in the eyes of some.</p><p><b>The launch of Knights of the Fallen Empire</b></p><p>Did you realise that we\'re less than a month away from the KotFE expansion turning ten years old? I\'m sure I\'m not the only long-time player who still thinks of everything pre-KotFE as the good old days, and everything that came after it as "the new stuff". It is after all a fact that it changed the game in bigger ways than perhaps anything that came afterwards, with the introduction of features like level sync or its complete overhaul of the companion system.</p><p>Still, I\'m not even talking about all of that. What made KotFE\'s launch a "you had to be there" moment was just <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/06/fallen-empire-stuff.html">how absolutely insane the hype was</a>. A new CGI trailer for the first time since launch! Accidental leaks with announcements that could be interpreted in multiple possible ways! General Star Wars hype as <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-star-wars-hype-is-building-up.html">we were all looking forward to the sequel trilogy</a>! (Oops.) Absolute mayhem!</p><p>And when it came out, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/10/knights-of-fallen-empires-story-is.html">people (including me) did indeed love it</a>! Mainstream gaming sites were like "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/knights-of-the-fallen-empire-a-great-solo-star-wars-story/" target="_blank">hey, this game still exists and is good</a>"! It felt like we were all set for a big SWTOR renaissance... except it all fizzled out within a couple of months. People thought the story was neat, but they didn\'t want to hang around to wait for one new chapter per month. They felt there wasn\'t enough to do at endgame. And those of us who <i>did</i> stick around quickly found out how tedious the new story was to play through on alts, never mind the plot going in directions that became more and more aggravating. For the second time in its life, SWTOR had released (something) with a lot of hype and then failed to live up to it.</p><p><b>Galactic Command</b></p><p>For anyone who might not know, Galactic Command was a new gearing/endgame progression system introduced&nbsp;with the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion, and in its original iteration, it was the worst system of its kind that I\'ve personally ever seen. To add insult to injury, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/10/galactic-command-bioware-trying-to.html">people (including me) were telling them from the moment it was announced that it was a bad idea</a>, but the devs were all "nah, it\'ll work and be fun, you\'ll see".</p><p>It didn\'t and it wasn\'t. For me, the early days of Galactic Command <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/12/control-alt-escape.html">were one of my all-time low points with the game</a>. Fortunately the devs scrambled to fix it immediately after launch, but it took about six months to get it into what could be described as an "acceptable" state and many players <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/11/galactic-command-is-alright-now.html">held a grudge long after</a>. It\'s another one of those things that in hindsight makes you wonder what could\'ve been <i>sooo</i> bad about it, but if you were there, you know.</p><p><b>Theron\'s betrayal</b></p><p>I did say there were spoilers in here,&nbsp;didn\'t I?&nbsp;I think looking at the game\'s storylines as a whole, the Fractured Alliances story (consisting of the three flashpoints Crisis on Umbara, Traitor Among the Chiss and The Nathema Conspiracy) is probably not among many people\'s favourites. The writing definitely felt like it had dug itself into a bit of a hole with Knights of the Eternal Throne, and it wasn\'t clear how it was going to get out of it.</p><p>I actually think that Fractured Alliances ultimately succeeded in what it set out to do, but it\'s fair to say that it was a bumpy ride. One thing I really did enjoy about it though was the community interactions it created. Theron\'s betrayal in Crisis on Umbara was not well-received for a <i>variety</i> of reasons, but it was interesting to watch the conversation around it evolve as more people started to believe that the whole thing was just a ruse. In hindsight, there are some hints towards this from the beginning, but they were easy to overlook at first.</p><p>People just didn\'t want their love interest to betray them, and there was even a hashtag called #believeintheron making the rounds on Twitter. I remember seeing screenshots of people assembling on Odessen with all their Therons out and forming a heart-shape or something. I just thought that was very cool, and actually kind of made me more invested in the final outcome than the story itself would have been able to do on its own.</p><p><b>Darth Malgus\' return</b></p><p>Back in 2017, I wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/10/11-npcs-that-died-before-their-time.html">11 NPCs That Died Before Their Time</a>" and Darth Malgus was second on my list. I just couldn\'t believe that they put him in all the cinematic trailers and then simply had him get killed off in one of the first endgame flashpoints! I\'m not sure I was aware at the time that there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajDDJDY0Y-k" target="_blank">a supposedly deleted scene from the KotFE trailer</a> that showed Malgus being delivered to Valkorion, frozen in a block of carbonite. Even if I was, it seemed obvious at the time that they\'d deleted it for a reason and for all intents and purposes, Malgus was still considered dead.</p><p>When he really did come back with the Ossus update at the end of 2018, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-return-of-spoiler.html">I absolutely loved it</a>. It was a really well-presented surprise, and while I don\'t think it was as big as the return of Revan, for me personally it was actually <i>more</i> meaningful than that had been. It\'s hard to think that it\'s already been seven years since then - at this point it feels like it should be obvious to everyone playing the game in any capacity at all that Darth Malgus is alive. However, that moment when we first found out was definitely special. (Cue some comment about how he\'s unfortunately outstayed his welcome since then.)</p><p><b>Move to Broadsword</b></p><p>Two years ago, when <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/swtor-to-move-from-bioware-to-broadsword.html">IGN leaked the news that Star Wars: The Old Republic was going to be transferred from Bioware to some largely unknown studio called Broadsword Entertainment</a>, all hell broke loose in the community for a few weeks.&nbsp;I think dedicated SWTOR players are quite used to endless doom-saying about the game and are well-practised at ignoring it by this point, but this sounded serious, and it was not at all clear what the consequences were going to be.</p><p>To me it was probably more worrying than even the original free-to-play announcement had been, and I found myself seeking solace in spending a lot more time than usual talking to fellow content creators. I also felt compelled to try and do my own part by practising something vaguely resembling journalism, which meant assembling information from different sources and trying to put it into context for people. In hindsight it seems almost silly how much we worried, considering how little changed from a player perspective after the studio transition, but at the time it was big news.</p><p><b>Runner-ups:</b></p><p>I could\'ve tried to come up with even more stories, but I thought that 10 was a good number to stop at. Nonetheless, here are three more events that I considered mentioning but decided against because they were mostly negative but also ultimately not <i>that</i> interesting to talk about in detail in my opinion:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The original free-to-play transition</li><li>The Legacy of the Sith expansion launch</li><li>The whole <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/character-modernisation-panic-on-pts.html">character texture update</a> drama</li></ul><p>Which of all of these events were you personally around for?

We all&nbsp;know Revan is in the game, right? There\'s a whole expansion called "Shadow of Revan", no? Well, for a moment, try to imagine that there wasn\'t. Revan is in the game, but only in this weird side quest that you\'ll only see if you like doing group content, and he\'s a prisoner one moment and a genocidal maniac the next, and if you blink you\'ll miss him dying as well. Also note that you had to have levelled through and done group content <i>on both factions</i> to be able to make sense of this brief cameo, something which fans of the original KotOR were not at all happy about.</p><p>Then it\'s 2014 - we\'ve been level 55 for a bit over a year, got several new daily areas and raids, everything\'s kind of chugging along nicely if you\'re not dying for your character\'s personal story to be continued... and then we start getting <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/04/assault-on-tython-and-korriban.html">a new series of flashpoints</a> that\'s being promoted as a new story arc called "Forged Alliances". That Theron guy is kinda cute, but aside from that it\'s all a bit mysterious. Who are these new troublemakers in the shadows? The answer came <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/09/legacy-of-rakata.html">in September</a>, in a post in which I felt the need to give a spoiler warning.</p><p>Whoa, Revan is back? Revan is <i>alive</i>? Is it really him though? And then <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/10/quick-30-announcement-thoughts.html">a whole expansion with his name</a>! It was exciting times for a while, showing once again that Revan\'s name still attracted the crowds. I think reception of the expansion storyline was ultimately a bit mixed - it gave the character a better send-off than the base game had for sure, but it was still a bit awkward in the eyes of some.</p><p><b>The launch of Knights of the Fallen Empire</b></p><p>Did you realise that we\'re less than a month away from the KotFE expansion turning ten years old? I\'m sure I\'m not the only long-time player who still thinks of everything pre-KotFE as the good old days, and everything that came after it as "the new stuff". It is after all a fact that it changed the game in bigger ways than perhaps anything that came afterwards, with the introduction of features like level sync or its complete overhaul of the companion system.</p><p>Still, I\'m not even talking about all of that. What made KotFE\'s launch a "you had to be there" moment was just <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/06/fallen-empire-stuff.html">how absolutely insane the hype was</a>. A new CGI trailer for the first time since launch! Accidental leaks with announcements that could be interpreted in multiple possible ways! General Star Wars hype as <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-star-wars-hype-is-building-up.html">we were all looking forward to the sequel trilogy</a>! (Oops.) Absolute mayhem!</p><p>And when it came out, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/10/knights-of-fallen-empires-story-is.html">people (including me) did indeed love it</a>! Mainstream gaming sites were like "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/knights-of-the-fallen-empire-a-great-solo-star-wars-story/" target="_blank">hey, this game still exists and is good</a>"! It felt like we were all set for a big SWTOR renaissance... except it all fizzled out within a couple of months. People thought the story was neat, but they didn\'t want to hang around to wait for one new chapter per month. They felt there wasn\'t enough to do at endgame. And those of us who <i>did</i> stick around quickly found out how tedious the new story was to play through on alts, never mind the plot going in directions that became more and more aggravating. For the second time in its life, SWTOR had released (something) with a lot of hype and then failed to live up to it.</p><p><b>Galactic Command</b></p><p>For anyone who might not know, Galactic Command was a new gearing/endgame progression system introduced&nbsp;with the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion, and in its original iteration, it was the worst system of its kind that I\'ve personally ever seen. To add insult to injury, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/10/galactic-command-bioware-trying-to.html">people (including me) were telling them from the moment it was announced that it was a bad idea</a>, but the devs were all "nah, it\'ll work and be fun, you\'ll see".</p><p>It didn\'t and it wasn\'t. For me, the early days of Galactic Command <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/12/control-alt-escape.html">were one of my all-time low points with the game</a>. Fortunately the devs scrambled to fix it immediately after launch, but it took about six months to get it into what could be described as an "acceptable" state and many players <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/11/galactic-command-is-alright-now.html">held a grudge long after</a>. It\'s another one of those things that in hindsight makes you wonder what could\'ve been <i>sooo</i> bad about it, but if you were there, you know.</p><p><b>Theron\'s betrayal</b></p><p>I did say there were spoilers in here,&nbsp;didn\'t I?&nbsp;I think looking at the game\'s storylines as a whole, the Fractured Alliances story (consisting of the three flashpoints Crisis on Umbara, Traitor Among the Chiss and The Nathema Conspiracy) is probably not among many people\'s favourites. The writing definitely felt like it had dug itself into a bit of a hole with Knights of the Eternal Throne, and it wasn\'t clear how it was going to get out of it.</p><p>I actually think that Fractured Alliances ultimately succeeded in what it set out to do, but it\'s fair to say that it was a bumpy ride. One thing I really did enjoy about it though was the community interactions it created. Theron\'s betrayal in Crisis on Umbara was not well-received for a <i>variety</i> of reasons, but it was interesting to watch the conversation around it evolve as more people started to believe that the whole thing was just a ruse. In hindsight, there are some hints towards this from the beginning, but they were easy to overlook at first.</p><p>People just didn\'t want their love interest to betray them, and there was even a hashtag called #believeintheron making the rounds on Twitter. I remember seeing screenshots of people assembling on Odessen with all their Therons out and forming a heart-shape or something. I just thought that was very cool, and actually kind of made me more invested in the final outcome than the story itself would have been able to do on its own.</p><p><b>Darth Malgus\' return</b></p><p>Back in 2017, I wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/10/11-npcs-that-died-before-their-time.html">11 NPCs That Died Before Their Time</a>" and Darth Malgus was second on my list. I just couldn\'t believe that they put him in all the cinematic trailers and then simply had him get killed off in one of the first endgame flashpoints! I\'m not sure I was aware at the time that there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajDDJDY0Y-k" target="_blank">a supposedly deleted scene from the KotFE trailer</a> that showed Malgus being delivered to Valkorion, frozen in a block of carbonite. Even if I was, it seemed obvious at the time that they\'d deleted it for a reason and for all intents and purposes, Malgus was still considered dead.</p><p>When he really did come back with the Ossus update at the end of 2018, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-return-of-spoiler.html">I absolutely loved it</a>. It was a really well-presented surprise, and while I don\'t think it was as big as the return of Revan, for me personally it was actually <i>more</i> meaningful than that had been. It\'s hard to think that it\'s already been seven years since then - at this point it feels like it should be obvious to everyone playing the game in any capacity at all that Darth Malgus is alive. However, that moment when we first found out was definitely special. (Cue some comment about how he\'s unfortunately outstayed his welcome since then.)</p><p><b>Move to Broadsword</b></p><p>Two years ago, when <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/swtor-to-move-from-bioware-to-broadsword.html">IGN leaked the news that Star Wars: The Old Republic was going to be transferred from Bioware to some largely unknown studio called Broadsword Entertainment</a>, all hell broke loose in the community for a few weeks.&nbsp;I think dedicated SWTOR players are quite used to endless doom-saying about the game and are well-practised at ignoring it by this point, but this sounded serious, and it was not at all clear what the consequences were going to be.</p><p>To me it was probably more worrying than even the original free-to-play announcement had been, and I found myself seeking solace in spending a lot more time than usual talking to fellow content creators. I also felt compelled to try and do my own part by practising something vaguely resembling journalism, which meant assembling information from different sources and trying to put it into context for people. In hindsight it seems almost silly how much we worried, considering how little changed from a player perspective after the studio transition, but at the time it was big news.</p><p><b>Runner-ups:</b></p><p>I could\'ve tried to come up with even more stories, but I thought that 10 was a good number to stop at. Nonetheless, here are three more events that I considered mentioning but decided against because they were mostly negative but also ultimately not <i>that</i> interesting to talk about in detail in my opinion:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The original free-to-play transition</li><li>The Legacy of the Sith expansion launch</li><li>The whole <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/character-modernisation-panic-on-pts.html">character texture update</a> drama</li></ul><p>Which of all of these events were you personally around for? Do you agree with my characterisation of how things went down? Are there any other major events in the game\'s history that you would\'ve included on this list?</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/10-moments-in-swtors-history-for-which.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/10-moments-in-swtors-history-for-which.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcsNcSxsfLhqSOCaVxJ1NWyLqP7L1d0CpzEKRIBtfDaSk-qki1XmEbXD298DqygHNtvzeinCG5LPio-Lfhykc8VHK5o4NA8R5o4FR3PeNiivndjqvOTvp8p7wP_RwslOKqfAELchTtXMzIVcPGmzMqh4rSicws7DVUaamRntcOPi3KRkceF2sv2MZ3H7A/s72-w99-h400-c/Getdown%20battle.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '13'}

While my initial reaction was skewing towards slightly negative, I was telling myself that this is probably one of those cases where I\'m just a weird outlier for liking something (group conversations in pug flashpoints) that many people don\'t like, and that I\'ll see the benefits of this change soon enough. I still remember <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-czerka-flashpoints-in-review.html">when the Czerka flashpoints first came out</a>&nbsp;back in 2013, I was actually somewhat disappointed at first that they were so streamlined without any interactive cut scenes, but I got over that pretty quickly.</p><p>One of the seasons objectives this week was to run either the Black Talon or the Esseles on veteran mode via the group finder, and with me doing Galactic Seasons on all servers I had plenty of opportunity to see the new change in action. For the most part, the experience was... fine. I\'m not going to pretend that I would have had so much more fun if I\'d gotten the full cut scene experience six times instead of the new fade to black thing. Primarily, it was all just kind of <i>weird</i>, with a lot of running back and forth with no discernible purpose when you don\'t actually have the story cut scenes to tell you what is happening.</p><p>There was one run that really annoyed me though. I got into an Esseles on a level 80 healer, and the other three members of the group were a level 80 dps, a level 10 and a level 14. I don\'t know if the two lowbies were new players or just alts, but either way they were subject to certain limitations at their low level, such as slower speed and lacking strong AoE abilities or defensives. Yet the level 80 was constantly mounting up and driving ahead, aggroing absolutely everything to pull it into a corner at the end, while the rest of us slowly jogged after them on foot. (I would\'ve been able to keep up more but I felt it was my duty to protect the lowbies, who would\'ve died several times if I hadn\'t healed them.)</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimdkGSdQiSS4eey0f_KQQR3sjZQc7opi2V6jnxakFbjNK6yJWa4tyEMsIlbA8XLuRqKFsYTtTQQEII7EpkfSR4E80GwU22CJrs5g_dFowEL44LXMuXxjBgkejuhPPZdutfZ0C3suWotuun1gT8_nTZetUXg6BBwFj1ckgC-RR4XL0MNhrLFRKho5AbC2Q/s300/Rushy%20player%20in%20the%20Esseles.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A chat screenshot from SWTOR.

I got the impression that at least one of them got a bit flustered by that and tried to overcompensate by mounting up and rushing ahead even of the level 80 at one point, just to then be told off because not everyone had made it up the elevator yet when we were put into combat as a result of that (which was technically correct but also must\'ve been confusing in terms of mixed messages).</p><p>I got really annoyed with that level 80\'s attitude but didn\'t say anything because frankly I was quite busy just keeping up with their constant running myself, as well as just keeping everyone else alive. I simply did what I could to support the lowbies, such as when one of them veered off towards the bonus boss while the 80 was just trying to go straight to the end. I just kept hoping that neither of the little guys were genuinely new players because if I had been a newbie in that situation, I would have been <i>so</i> put off from running flashpoints ever again.</p><p>Now, to be clear, all of this technically has nothing to do with the cut scene change, because people could act like that while the group conversations were still a thing. However, at least the cut scenes would put the brakes on things a little bit. They were a reminder that this flashpoint wasn\'t <i>designed</i> to be rushed like that. And I feel that the removal of the cut scenes does the opposite now, vindicating people like that level 80 in the sense that yes, the devs agree with you that flashpoints are something to get over and done with as quickly as possible. I feel like my opinion was validated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1mvj1j5/group_finder_flashpoint_skippers_are_insatiable/">a thread on the SWTOR subreddit</a>&nbsp;posted this week about how this kind of behaviour seemed to be worse than ever since the patch. In a comment thread there, someone who commented that "games are meant to be fun" also received the reply: "It\'s a season objective. <b>Literally not meant to be fun.</b> Just a way to progress."</p><p>I just kept thinking to myself: What are we doing here? Why are we optimising content for people who don\'t like it? And I realised that I\'m worried about SWTOR flashpoints going down the way of World of Warcraft dungeons.</p><p>WoW was my first MMO as well as my introduction to doing group content with random players, and I <i>loved</i> it. The first time I did the Deadmines? Amazing. I got yelled at for ninja-looting a chest because I didn\'t know any better, but I apologised, learned from it and we moved on. For about three or four years, dungeons were easily one of my favourite things to do in the game. However, somewhere along the line, things changed. Blizzard wanted players to run dungeons in greater numbers and more often, so they became increasingly incentivised for endless replay, and people\'s attitudes changed accordingly.</p><p>I still play WoW almost twenty years later, but I rarely do dungeons in its modern incarnation now. Every now and then some reward will lure me into queueing up for a pug dungeon again, just for me to instantly be reminded of why I no longer find them fun. Everything is just an insane rush to the end to pick up the reward and it\'s a casual or new player\'s absolute nightmare.</p><p>When I started playing SWTOR, I instantly fell in love with the game\'s flashpoints too. The Esseles and Black Talon are absolutely amazing experiences that have no real equivalent in other games when you play through them in a group for the first time and as intended (which is to say, actually paying attention to the story and listening to the group conversations). They are also clearly not intended to be re-run on a daily basis. Sure, they can be fun to re-play every now and then, to see what different conversation choices do and so on, but it\'s clearly not something you\'re supposed to do <i>all the time</i>. The game won\'t stop you from running it multiple times a day if you want to, but I think it\'s fair to say that you were effectively "doing it wrong" in that case and couldn\'t really complain if it wasn\'t super fun. The idea with SWTOR flashpoints was that they were still meant to be a bit of an adventure every time you entered one, something you can only really consume in moderation.</p><p>With this change... I don\'t really know anymore. I can even defend the removal of cut scenes as a temporary measure for the Galactic Season, mostly because it benefits me personally, but people like me, who do Galactic Seasons on every server, can hardly make up a significant chunk of the player base. Clearly the intent is to get more players into flashpoints that haven\'t done them before, but I\'m not sure this whole exercise is going to show them anything appealing enough to want to come back. Endless running along corridors with no rhyme or reason about what is going on? What\'s appealing about that?</p><p>I also saw someone comment somewhere that Final Fantasy XIV used to have a similar problem with new players having a bad experience in the group finder due to issues with cut scene skipping, and Square Enix\'s solution to that was to make the cut scenes unskippable for <i>everyone</i> and increase the reward payout to make sure veterans were being suitably compensated for the fact that the run was taking longer to accommodate the newbies. Now, I don\'t play FFXIV myself, so I can\'t tell you how well that worked out for everyone, but I think it shows that "whelp, we\'ve got to cater to the people who are in a hurry" is not an inevitability. SWTOR and FF have a lot in common in terms of their focus on story, so it\'s actually kind of odd to me now to see the SWTOR devs choose speed-running over story in this instance.</p><p>At this point, after thinking about it some more, I feel like instead of removing cut scenes all over the place they should\'ve gone back and reconsidered what flashpoints are all about and why people are funnelled into them the way they are. Why do people ask to skip cut scenes? Because they\'re in a flashpoint they don\'t really want to be in. Why are they in this flashpoint? Because we give extra rewards for queueing for a random flashpoint. Why do we give rewards for that? So people who want to run specific flashpoints can get groups for them. But why would people run the Esseles in a group these days when there is a solo mode available anyway? Maybe the devs should\'ve just taken it out of the group finder like they did Kuat and Colicoid War Games. Leaving it in but taking out everything that actually made it unique and insteresting just feels like extremely muddled game design to me. It just doesn\'t make sense in my head.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>I\'ve been having fun with the new season so far and will probably talk about that at some point, but the <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/a-farewell-to-pug-cut-scenes.html">removal of cut scenes and group conversations from the group finder</a> continues to weigh heavily on my mind.

I got the impression that at least one of them got a bit flustered by that and tried to overcompensate by mounting up and rushing ahead even of the level 80 at one point, just to then be told off because not everyone had made it up the elevator yet when we were put into combat as a result of that (which was technically correct but also must\'ve been confusing in terms of mixed messages).</p><p>I got really annoyed with that level 80\'s attitude but didn\'t say anything because frankly I was quite busy just keeping up with their constant running myself, as well as just keeping everyone else alive. I simply did what I could to support the lowbies, such as when one of them veered off towards the bonus boss while the 80 was just trying to go straight to the end. I just kept hoping that neither of the little guys were genuinely new players because if I had been a newbie in that situation, I would have been <i>so</i> put off from running flashpoints ever again.</p><p>Now, to be clear, all of this technically has nothing to do with the cut scene change, because people could act like that while the group conversations were still a thing. However, at least the cut scenes would put the brakes on things a little bit. They were a reminder that this flashpoint wasn\'t <i>designed</i> to be rushed like that. And I feel that the removal of the cut scenes does the opposite now, vindicating people like that level 80 in the sense that yes, the devs agree with you that flashpoints are something to get over and done with as quickly as possible. I feel like my opinion was validated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1mvj1j5/group_finder_flashpoint_skippers_are_insatiable/">a thread on the SWTOR subreddit</a>&nbsp;posted this week about how this kind of behaviour seemed to be worse than ever since the patch. In a comment thread there, someone who commented that "games are meant to be fun" also received the reply: "It\'s a season objective. <b>Literally not meant to be fun.</b> Just a way to progress."</p><p>I just kept thinking to myself: What are we doing here? Why are we optimising content for people who don\'t like it? And I realised that I\'m worried about SWTOR flashpoints going down the way of World of Warcraft dungeons.</p><p>WoW was my first MMO as well as my introduction to doing group content with random players, and I <i>loved</i> it. The first time I did the Deadmines? Amazing. I got yelled at for ninja-looting a chest because I didn\'t know any better, but I apologised, learned from it and we moved on. For about three or four years, dungeons were easily one of my favourite things to do in the game. However, somewhere along the line, things changed. Blizzard wanted players to run dungeons in greater numbers and more often, so they became increasingly incentivised for endless replay, and people\'s attitudes changed accordingly.</p><p>I still play WoW almost twenty years later, but I rarely do dungeons in its modern incarnation now. Every now and then some reward will lure me into queueing up for a pug dungeon again, just for me to instantly be reminded of why I no longer find them fun. Everything is just an insane rush to the end to pick up the reward and it\'s a casual or new player\'s absolute nightmare.</p><p>When I started playing SWTOR, I instantly fell in love with the game\'s flashpoints too. The Esseles and Black Talon are absolutely amazing experiences that have no real equivalent in other games when you play through them in a group for the first time and as intended (which is to say, actually paying attention to the story and listening to the group conversations). They are also clearly not intended to be re-run on a daily basis. Sure, they can be fun to re-play every now and then, to see what different conversation choices do and so on, but it\'s clearly not something you\'re supposed to do <i>all the time</i>. The game won\'t stop you from running it multiple times a day if you want to, but I think it\'s fair to say that you were effectively "doing it wrong" in that case and couldn\'t really complain if it wasn\'t super fun. The idea with SWTOR flashpoints was that they were still meant to be a bit of an adventure every time you entered one, something you can only really consume in moderation.</p><p>With this change... I don\'t really know anymore. I can even defend the removal of cut scenes as a temporary measure for the Galactic Season, mostly because it benefits me personally, but people like me, who do Galactic Seasons on every server, can hardly make up a significant chunk of the player base. Clearly the intent is to get more players into flashpoints that haven\'t done them before, but I\'m not sure this whole exercise is going to show them anything appealing enough to want to come back. Endless running along corridors with no rhyme or reason about what is going on? What\'s appealing about that?</p><p>I also saw someone comment somewhere that Final Fantasy XIV used to have a similar problem with new players having a bad experience in the group finder due to issues with cut scene skipping, and Square Enix\'s solution to that was to make the cut scenes unskippable for <i>everyone</i> and increase the reward payout to make sure veterans were being suitably compensated for the fact that the run was taking longer to accommodate the newbies. Now, I don\'t play FFXIV myself, so I can\'t tell you how well that worked out for everyone, but I think it shows that "whelp, we\'ve got to cater to the people who are in a hurry" is not an inevitability. SWTOR and FF have a lot in common in terms of their focus on story, so it\'s actually kind of odd to me now to see the SWTOR devs choose speed-running over story in this instance.</p><p>At this point, after thinking about it some more, I feel like instead of removing cut scenes all over the place they should\'ve gone back and reconsidered what flashpoints are all about and why people are funnelled into them the way they are. Why do people ask to skip cut scenes? Because they\'re in a flashpoint they don\'t really want to be in. Why are they in this flashpoint? Because we give extra rewards for queueing for a random flashpoint. Why do we give rewards for that? So people who want to run specific flashpoints can get groups for them. But why would people run the Esseles in a group these days when there is a solo mode available anyway? Maybe the devs should\'ve just taken it out of the group finder like they did Kuat and Colicoid War Games. Leaving it in but taking out everything that actually made it unique and insteresting just feels like extremely muddled game design to me. It just doesn\'t make sense in my head.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/flashpoints-why-are-we-here.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/flashpoints-why-are-we-here.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimdkGSdQiSS4eey0f_KQQR3sjZQc7opi2V6jnxakFbjNK6yJWa4tyEMsIlbA8XLuRqKFsYTtTQQEII7EpkfSR4E80GwU22CJrs5g_dFowEL44LXMuXxjBgkejuhPPZdutfZ0C3suWotuun1gT8_nTZetUXg6BBwFj1ckgC-RR4XL0MNhrLFRKho5AbC2Q/s72-c/Rushy%20player%20in%20the%20Esseles.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '3'}

I loved it when I found my people! And when someone disagreed about what the "right" choice was in a certain scenario, there was usually some friendly banter to be had. No more.</p><p></p><p>(Just as a disclaimer so nobody gets the wrong idea: I didn\'t "force" any of these pugs to wait for me while I was watching cut scenes.

You can actually get <i>most</i> of the way towards your personal Conquest target by doing that every day, assuming that you\'ll also have a companion go up an influence level at least once or twice in the process.</p><p>It\'s felt kind of satisfying, but also made me realise just how slow of a process it is if you\'re just sitting there waiting for your companions to run missions or craft things, especially if your character isn\'t that progressed and therefore doesn\'t have that many companions yet and they aren\'t of particularly high influence. I haven\'t really felt the weight of that in a long time, considering how long most of my characters on Darth Malgus have been maxed out in everything.</p><p>Sadly my efforts haven\'t made much of a dent in the pile of mission discoveries yet since a lot of them require pretty high skills to use, but at least I\'m making <i>some</i> progress.

Like I said back then, other people feel motivated to play in order to earn free items; I feel driven to play in order to deal with all the free items that are being thrust upon me!</p><p>I also realised that with each character having three crew skills that cap out at 700 points each, raising them at a rate of one skill-up per day to maximise Conquest points would take almost six years per character. There really was no need for me to artificially try and slow things down.</p><p>So I\'ve been logging into at least one character per server per day over the past few weeks to level up their crew skills. You can actually get <i>most</i> of the way towards your personal Conquest target by doing that every day, assuming that you\'ll also have a companion go up an influence level at least once or twice in the process.</p><p>It\'s felt kind of satisfying, but also made me realise just how slow of a process it is if you\'re just sitting there waiting for your companions to run missions or craft things, especially if your character isn\'t that progressed and therefore doesn\'t have that many companions yet and they aren\'t of particularly high influence. I haven\'t really felt the weight of that in a long time, considering how long most of my characters on Darth Malgus have been maxed out in everything.</p><p>Sadly my efforts haven\'t made much of a dent in the pile of mission discoveries yet since a lot of them require pretty high skills to use, but at least I\'m making <i>some</i> progress. I think my main takeaway from the whole exercise is that next season I\'ll need to remember to run at least a couple of crew skills on the side during each "proper" play session to make sure I can get them levelled up more consistently.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/skilling-those-crews.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/skilling-those-crews.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'thr_total': '1'}

Dromund Kaas</b></p><p>If you split the seven planets that had dynamic encounters added in 7.7 into three groups - capital worlds, starter planets and Ilum - I think both of the capital worlds definitely came out on top. With more than twenty unique encounters per planet they offer the most variety of the bunch, as well as offering an easy way to grind Conquest points.</p><p>The encounters on Dromund Kaas are thematically very varied, mostly leaning into the different regional "themes" previously established in side missions, such as the spaceport being somewhat in disarray or the lightning spires being under attack. They mostly seem to be set in the same time period as those original exploration missions, though I noticed while dispersing unruly Imperial citizens in Kaas City that one of them yelled "What is Xarion hiding?", which I thought was an interesting detail that would place that one after Onslaught in the timeline.</p><p>In general, most of the encounters are quick and fun, and strategically placed in locations where people are bound to come through on their way to some other mission objective, making it very temping to allow yourself to be distracted for a moment to complete an encounter. Prime examples of this are doing "Bad Monkey" just after arriving at the spaceport, or hunting down the rogue bounty hunter while passing through Kaas City.</p><p>If I had to cite anything negative, I\'d say that there are a <i>couple</i> of encounters with flaws. The Apex Predator in "Shock and Awe" feels way overtuned for levelling players (trying to solo it on a level thirty-something with a healer companion I was chunked to death within only a couple of hits), and the final boss for "Kubaz Incursion" can be a bit annoyingly hard to find. "Powder Keg" actually being possible to fail is a neat idea but the fact that it\'s the only encounter of this kind and that it\'s not obvious at all what is going on unless you\'re already in the know makes it a bit unpleasant in that regard.</p><p>Also, I wish they\'d fix encounter voice lines sometimes playing when the encounter isn\'t even up, because every time my speeder rides past the lightning spires I get spammed with yells about multiple encounters that may not actually all be active.</p><p>Anyway, all in all it\'s still a fun romp, and the reason it\'s edging out Coruscant for first place in my opinion is that the map makes it both cheap and easy to get around if you want to do multiple encounters. Which brings us to...</p><p><b>2. Coruscant&nbsp;</b></p><p>In general, Coruscant is one of <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/03/all-swtor-planets-ranked-from-best-to.html">my top three planets in the entire game</a>, and most positive things I said about the dynamic encounters on Dromund Kaas above also apply to Coruscant. The reason I put it in second place is simply the fact that it\'s a bit of a pain to travel between dynamic encounters due to the planetary layout with the different sectors, which all count as being really far apart, which in turn means that moving between them always requires either a looong taxi ride or paying the maximum price for quick travel. Even if you do opt for quick travel though, the sectors are still laid out in such a way that it can be a pain to just travel from one dynamic encounter within the same sector to the next one.</p><p>The said, I adore most of the encounters in the Senate Plaza, which is where I\'m always passing through when I exit my stronghold, and I basically never pass on an opportunity to set off some fireworks or to help clean up the party\'s aftermath.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/s1920/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Fireworks going off at the Senate Plaza on Coruscant" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/w400-h225/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Negatives are that some of the Black Sun and Justicar encounters don\'t have nearly enough clickies if there\'s even more than one person trying to do the encounter at the same time, the way Ugnaught Engineering was horrifically bugged when it first came out and made people get into fights about who was supposedly <i>causing</i> it to bug, stealing kills or whatever (regardless of whether it was true or not), and the one encounter on the Senate Plaza that I don\'t like, "Understaffed".

Tython&nbsp;</b></p><p>Next we have the starter planets, which I think are all pretty similar in quality, and I don\'t feel particularly strongly about the order in which I\'ve ranked them against each other. The main reason I consider them worse than the capital planets it that there are very few encounters, so you\'ll run out of things to do pretty quickly if you\'re just trying to grind on a single planet, and that none of the DEs on the starter planets give Conquest points. I can see why the devs decided to have that limitation, but it still means that for someone who\'s very Conquest-focused like me, they tend to have a lot less replay value.</p><p>With that general preamble out of the way, Tython is definitely my favourite of the bunch, since it\'s my favourite of all the starter planets and I think all its dynamic encounters are very on point, whether you\'re doing simple chores at the Jedi Temple or beating back the flesh raiders.</p><p>The only thing I\'ll say is that I do wonder a little how having a dynamic encounter pop up the moment you leave your intro phase is going to affect new players\' perception of the planet and the game as a whole, and whether it might make things come off as a bit "loud" and overwhelming to less experienced gamers. I would love to have insight into the devs\' behavioural metrics on the starter planets for that one...&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>4. Hutta</b></p><p>Hutta is actually one of my least favourite planets, generally speaking, but I think in terms of dynamic encounters it works well enough. Again, the themes of the encounters go very well with what\'s also conveyed via the existing side missions, from dangerous wildlife to rebellious evocii.</p><p>The only thing I\'m not so sure about is having an encounter that is basically a vehicle quest right outside the spawn phase, because it makes me wonder whether that isn\'t a bit confusing/overwhelming for new players. Even if seeing a bunch of droids enter the gang wars right outside the Poison Pit <i>does</i> serve to drive home the point that the town is a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/s1920/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A walker on Ord Mantell surrounded by dozens of loot beams" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/w400-h225/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>5. Ord Mantell</b><p></p><p>Ord Mantell is one of two planets where I actually feel like some of the encounters are <i>slightly</i> off in tone. This may very well be my personal bias speaking, as someone who mains a trooper and was instantly scarred by being blamed for the death of Bellis the informant at the hands of the separatists by multiple people, but I always perceived the whole setting with the separatists as very dark and desperate. Even the smuggler story with all its goofiness has a pretty dark turn here with Corso\'s parents being dead because of the separatists and him having that one moment where he wants to execute that random sep in cold blood.</p><p>With that said, I just feel like some of the encounters involving separatists feel a bit too silly. Like that mad scientist type sending you out to shoot separatists with one of his droids? It\'s one thing if there\'s a specific NPC that\'s bit ridiculous when you talk to them, that\'s clearly just that one character, but the fact that you hear the dynamic encounter yells repeated endlessly even when you\'re just driving by gives them a much stronger impact on the mood in my opinion. Might just be me.</p><p><b>6. Korriban</b></p><p>That\'s also the reason why I rate Korriban last of this batch, because again, several of the encounters just feel a <i>bit</i> too goofy to me personally. Don\'t get me wrong, both the Sith warrior and inquisitor stories have plenty of humorous moments even on Korriban, but I still always got the vibe that as a <i>setting</i>, the planet is clearly meant to be very grim, with all the racial purity nonsense and dog-eat-dog behaviour encouraged in the acolytes. Stuff like k\'lor\'slugs running wild around the academy feels more like the kind of hijinx you\'d find in a young adult book series about a magic school. (That said, looking at how busy each planet is, this one actually seems to be very popular with people, so again, this might just be me.)</p><p><b>7. Ilum&nbsp;</b></p><p>Finally, in last place - alas, poor Ilum. I really wanted the addition of dynamic encounters to this planet to feel like a revival for it. I have some fond memories of Ilum from the game\'s early days, even though it felt somewhat unfinished even then, but over time it\'s only ever declined in relevance. Sadly I can\'t say that I feel like dynamic encounters have put it back on people\'s radar, and based on the small number of other people I see doing encounters there, I get the impression that it didn\'t really land for the majority of the population either.</p><p>Good things first: the theming is once again spot-on on this one. They really leaned into the Republic vs. Empire conflict from the original storyline and even added some encounter achievements that are meant to encourage world PvP. (I\'m 99% sure that almost nobody will bother with those, but I appreciate the effort.) On the Western Ice Shelf, they\'ve expanded on the lore of the Tonvarr Pirates that were previously only really relevant during the Gree event. It all works.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/s1920/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Sith Pureblood, surrounded by pets and companions, sits on the stone throne inside Fort Tonvarr" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/w400-h225/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The problem is simply that too many of the encounters are just not very fun. Too many of them have multiple stages and feature a large number of mobs - when sometimes mob-killing isn\'t even part of the main objective, which makes it feel like you\'re just endlessly wading back and forth through constantly respawning mobs to actually get to the next clicky you need. It just feels tedious to the point that my brain keeps trying to forget that Ilum is another planet that has dynamic encounters now and I very rarely even remember to go there.</p><p>All that said, I wanted to also give a shout-out to a change to dynamic encounters in general that came with 7.7 but that I didn\'t see in the patch notes: When they released these new encounters, they changed it so that on staged DEs, you no longer need to complete every single stage by yourself to get credit, but rather you can join in at any time and still get completion. I feel that this has been a great change and has been most noticeable for me during encounters such as the base attacks on Tatooine and Hoth. It used to be that I felt that there was no point in joining in if people were already fighting the stage two walker, as it wouldn\'t give me anything and I\'d just have to restart the encounter from scratch afterwards anyway. Now I\'ll gleefully jump in and help out because I\'ll actually be rewarded for it too, which I think has been a great change.</p><p>How many of the new encounters have you done at this point? And do you agree with my ranking of the planets or not?

Even if seeing a bunch of droids enter the gang wars right outside the Poison Pit <i>does</i> serve to drive home the point that the town is a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/s1920/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A walker on Ord Mantell surrounded by dozens of loot beams" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/w400-h225/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>5. Ord Mantell</b><p></p><p>Ord Mantell is one of two planets where I actually feel like some of the encounters are <i>slightly</i> off in tone. This may very well be my personal bias speaking, as someone who mains a trooper and was instantly scarred by being blamed for the death of Bellis the informant at the hands of the separatists by multiple people, but I always perceived the whole setting with the separatists as very dark and desperate. Even the smuggler story with all its goofiness has a pretty dark turn here with Corso\'s parents being dead because of the separatists and him having that one moment where he wants to execute that random sep in cold blood.</p><p>With that said, I just feel like some of the encounters involving separatists feel a bit too silly. Like that mad scientist type sending you out to shoot separatists with one of his droids? It\'s one thing if there\'s a specific NPC that\'s bit ridiculous when you talk to them, that\'s clearly just that one character, but the fact that you hear the dynamic encounter yells repeated endlessly even when you\'re just driving by gives them a much stronger impact on the mood in my opinion. Might just be me.</p><p><b>6. Korriban</b></p><p>That\'s also the reason why I rate Korriban last of this batch, because again, several of the encounters just feel a <i>bit</i> too goofy to me personally. Don\'t get me wrong, both the Sith warrior and inquisitor stories have plenty of humorous moments even on Korriban, but I still always got the vibe that as a <i>setting</i>, the planet is clearly meant to be very grim, with all the racial purity nonsense and dog-eat-dog behaviour encouraged in the acolytes. Stuff like k\'lor\'slugs running wild around the academy feels more like the kind of hijinx you\'d find in a young adult book series about a magic school. (That said, looking at how busy each planet is, this one actually seems to be very popular with people, so again, this might just be me.)</p><p><b>7. Ilum&nbsp;</b></p><p>Finally, in last place - alas, poor Ilum. I really wanted the addition of dynamic encounters to this planet to feel like a revival for it. I have some fond memories of Ilum from the game\'s early days, even though it felt somewhat unfinished even then, but over time it\'s only ever declined in relevance. Sadly I can\'t say that I feel like dynamic encounters have put it back on people\'s radar, and based on the small number of other people I see doing encounters there, I get the impression that it didn\'t really land for the majority of the population either.</p><p>Good things first: the theming is once again spot-on on this one. They really leaned into the Republic vs. Empire conflict from the original storyline and even added some encounter achievements that are meant to encourage world PvP. (I\'m 99% sure that almost nobody will bother with those, but I appreciate the effort.) On the Western Ice Shelf, they\'ve expanded on the lore of the Tonvarr Pirates that were previously only really relevant during the Gree event. It all works.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/s1920/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Sith Pureblood, surrounded by pets and companions, sits on the stone throne inside Fort Tonvarr" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/w400-h225/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The problem is simply that too many of the encounters are just not very fun. Too many of them have multiple stages and feature a large number of mobs - when sometimes mob-killing isn\'t even part of the main objective, which makes it feel like you\'re just endlessly wading back and forth through constantly respawning mobs to actually get to the next clicky you need. It just feels tedious to the point that my brain keeps trying to forget that Ilum is another planet that has dynamic encounters now and I very rarely even remember to go there.</p><p>All that said, I wanted to also give a shout-out to a change to dynamic encounters in general that came with 7.7 but that I didn\'t see in the patch notes: When they released these new encounters, they changed it so that on staged DEs, you no longer need to complete every single stage by yourself to get credit, but rather you can join in at any time and still get completion. I feel that this has been a great change and has been most noticeable for me during encounters such as the base attacks on Tatooine and Hoth. It used to be that I felt that there was no point in joining in if people were already fighting the stage two walker, as it wouldn\'t give me anything and I\'d just have to restart the encounter from scratch afterwards anyway. Now I\'ll gleefully jump in and help out because I\'ll actually be rewarded for it too, which I think has been a great change.</p><p>How many of the new encounters have you done at this point? And do you agree with my ranking of the planets or not? Let me know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/ranking-77-dynamic-encounter-planets.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/ranking-77-dynamic-encounter-planets.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/s72-w400-h225-c/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

I <i>did</i> get both of those things, but as I always do, I have some nits to pick as well.</p><p><b>Story is coming... but later and perhaps less than we\'d hoped</b></p><p>At least when talking with some of my friends, there had been a hope expressed that the next story patch would be one big "catch-up patch" giving us a bigger chunk of story than usual, kind of like how Echoes of Oblivion and Spirit of Vengeance (which were originally supposed to be separate pieces of content) were both released at the same time after delays caused by Covid.</p><p>This... is not going to be the case. 7.8, which will come out before Christmas, will have the "Galactic Threads" story that was originally meant to be included in patch 7.6 last Christmas, and then they\'ll speed up a little bit and add "Master\'s Engima", the story originally built for patch 7.7, with 7.8.1, which should then launch at some point early next year and would usually have included only the start of Galactic Season 10 and no story update.</p><p>While I\'m glad to finally have something close to a date, having to wait another four months or so until the next story drop still hurts - by that point the game will have gone nearly 18 months without a story patch, which is unprecedented in this MMO\'s history.</p><p>The other thing that stuck out to me is that if we\'re getting the story that was meant to be in 7.6 in 7.8, what was meant to be in 7.8 before that? No story? Ultimately it feels like aside from the delays, we also <i>lost</i> one of the twice-a-year story installments due to the strike, which sucks.</p><p>Same thing with date nights by the way - they mentioned working on one back in the 7.6.1 stream, but now we won\'t even get one with 7.7.1, with the next expected release (Torian and Kira) coming with 7.8.1 next year.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Galactic Season 9: Flashpoint Resurgence</b></p><p>As for GS9, its theme is flashpoints. Yippee! There will be Czerka buffs involved like there were for uprisings during GS8, which I don\'t really care about, but I\'m good with running flashpoints with or without buffs. Unfortunately it sounded like the objectives will be veteran mode only, which is a bit disappointing to me personally and will not encourage my guildies to group up I reckon, but still, it\'s flashpoints.</p><p>The most interesting bit of the stream to me personally was the devs talking about how they were using the occasion of this seasonal focus on flashpoints to make some changes to the activity finder. A big quality of life improvement they will make is that you\'ll finally be able to queue as multiple roles again, change roles while queueing (so that you can e.g. do dailies in a dps spec while queueing for a flashpoint as healer) and it will take both of your combat styles into account, meaning you could queue as all <i>three</i> roles if you wanted and have the right combat styles for it. Now, to be clear, only the last bit of that is actually new - both the ability to queue for multiple roles and the ability to queue as a different role than you\'re currently playing were in the game before but got patched out at some point, I think because they were buggy or causing issues of some sort. Still, I\'m very glad to see these features make a comeback at last.</p><p>They are also going to improve the loot you get in flashpoints while levelling, though it\'s not entirely clear what that will mean - I\'m guessing more gear that is actually appropriate for your level and combat style, because getting drops that you can\'t even use or not use for another twenty levels was definitely a thing sometimes.</p><p>For the max levels, you\'ll no longer have to queue for all flashpoints to be eligible for additional daily/weekly rewards, but can exclude a few that you may want to avoid. You still won\'t be rewarded for just spamming Hammer Station and nothing else, but you can untick a couple you don\'t like, which I guess is nice.&nbsp;</p><p><b>No more "spacebar plz"</b></p><p>The thing that kind of shocked me was that in connection to all these flashpoint changes, queued veteran and master mode flashpoints will no longer feature any cut scenes or group conversations; everything will just be auto-skipped and if there was some sort of decision to be made (such as whether to kill or spare the captain in the Black Talon) it will just do so automatically. If you want to see the conversations and cut scenes in the future, you\'ll need to do story mode (where available) or manually walk into the higher difficulty with some friends.</p><p>Now, I completely understand why they are doing this and I\'m sure many people will consider this a major quality of life improvement. I made a whole <a href="https://youtu.be/7Wy2EA4fZrQ?si=CP0QdGpEjH5tDKy6&amp;t=144">compilation poking fun at people\'s urge to skip the cut scenes</a> <i>seven years ago</i>. I\'ve seen it all, from the guy who drops group the moment you zone into the Esseles or Black Talon, to endless arguments about who isn\'t hitting their space bar and why. It was a source of friction for sure.</p><p>AND YET. I myself have always loved the group conversations in flashpoints and was generally happy to watch cut scenes if other people wanted to do so too. I enjoy running flashpoints, but I never "spammed" them to the point where getting the Esseles again made me frustrated. (The only flashpoint that I\'ve managed to get utterly sick of is Hammer Station, and that has nothing to do with cut scenes and everything to do with the community.)</p><p>I also felt that the group conversations often inspired fun little interactions, such as when a dark or light side choice got people chatting. My guildies have seen me express (not-entirely-serious) outrage at killing the engineers or leaving Asara behind in the Esseles more than a few times. And some of the cut scenes also just genuinely looked nice! I have a whole collection of screenshots of pugs in Czerka Corporate Labs, from that last cut scene that shows your group walking into the room looking heroic.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s1741/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Four SWTOR characters about to face down the last boss in Czerka Corporate Labs.

Telling me that you can <i>technically</i> build a group manually and walk in to still see the cut scenes is a bit of a cold comfort because let\'s be real, how often do people do that? How often have you run Kuat Drive Yards since it was removed from the group finder? I just feel like this is going to be one of those things that will end up having negative ripple effects that people won\'t fully feel until later down the line. Or maybe I\'m just a relic of ancient times for having actually enjoyed interacting with my pug mates in small ways, even if there was friction sometimes.</p><p><b>Be free, F2P-ers!</b></p><p>A big change for free-to-play players that\'s coming with the next patch is that the devs will be dropping a <i>lot</i> of the old restrictions on that type of account. You will now also get sprint at level 1,&nbsp;have all action bars unlocked,&nbsp;be able to hide your head slot&nbsp; and equip random purples that you get while levelling. Honestly, with some of the things they mentioned I didn\'t even know there were restrictions for that: What, F2P players couldn\'t display legacy titles before? Or equip companion customisations? WTF?</p><p>Even as someone who\'s always been subscribed, I think this is great news. SWTOR has had a reputation for having extremely draconian F2P restrictions for a long time - I remember how the limited action bars were a source of ridicule across the entire MMO community when the game first went free-to-play. I think the devs did the right thing by being cautious when they first changed payment model back in the day (mostly because other MMOs that followed suit later and kept crowing about how much more generous their F2P model was in comparison, such as Rift and Wildstar, did ultimately not end up doing well).</p><p>However, all of that was over a decade ago, times have changed, and there\'s just no reason to be quite so brutal with all those restrictions on what\'s effectively the game\'s free trial mode. Annoying players with arbitrary feature locks before they\'ve even left the starter planet was just never great, and I hope that these changes will give more people a chance to actually fall in love with what the game has to offer and then spend some money on it happily instead of feeling nagged from the get-go.</p><p><b>What about subscribers though?</b></p><p>So as not to leave subscribers feeling unappreciated, the game will run a new "subscriber login event" from September to December where you\'ll earn a special currency if you log in at least four times a week, which you can then use to buy some goodies. I kinda raised my eyebrow a bit at one of those goodies supposedly being "endgame gear" but we\'ll see. I really don\'t need more free stuff myself, but I can\'t blame them for trying to offer subscribers a bit more carrot while easing up on the F2P stick.</p><p><b>Say farewell to endless free CC</b></p><p>Speaking of carrots and sticks, regardless of your subscription status, you\'ve long gained 100 free Cartel Coins per month if you\'ve got a security key attached to your account. I often saw delighted comments from people who came back to the game after some time away to find that they\'d accumulated thousands of free Cartel Coins while not playing. While that was nice, considering for how long the game has been running at this point, I can\'t blame the bean counters for concluding that someone coming back after years and immediately finding $40 worth of Cartel Coins in their account was maybe not so good for their bottom line. No, that free CC is not going to go away, but it will only be awarded going forward if your account was actually active in the last 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Decos, Graphics, DirectX</b></p><p>Under "other topics about which I don\'t have that much to say", we have the Feast of Prosperity returning this autumn with some awesome new decos that I\'ll definitely want to grind for. (I actually broke my habit of ignoring Twitch chat to type "LOVE LAMP" when they showed the new ceiling lights.)&nbsp;</p><p>The character customisation updates continue, with Rattataki getting updated textures next, and dark-side corruption getting a much-needed revamp so that it no longer turns every character into a pasty white dude regardless of their previous skin colour. (I might actually give showing it on my dark-siders a try once this goes live - I previously always disabled it precisely because it changed your skin colour <i>so</i> much and I didn\'t want to look like an albino axolotl.) Also, after they added all those skin colours for aliens in the last patch, they are expanding on this by adding more hair and montral colours with 7.7.1.</p><p>Finally, in technical news that I have to file under "I don\'t know enough about this to have an opinion but I guess it sounds good", they are making good progress on updating the game to DirectX 12 but there\'s still some work left to do.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, if you want ALL THE DEETS, including things I didn\'t mention here and images of various rewards, here are some other places you can look:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0E_bwCPnoM">VOD on YouTube</a> (Twitch had some hiccups and split it into several parts)&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/%5Bnews-category%5D/20250730">Official recap article</a></li><li><a href="https://swtorista.com/articles/what-to-expect-in-update-7-7-1-in-swtor-august-2025/">Swtorista</a></li><li><a href="https://todayintor.com/2025/06/28/swtor-7-7-1-update-news/">Today in TOR</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>I was somewhat disappointed by the <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/02/a-season-of-uprisings-and.html">last two</a> <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/05/77-dev-stream-more-alien-colours-are.html">dev streams</a>, but the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-sag-aftra-members-approve-2025-interactive-media-agreement">voice actors\' strike ended a few weeks ago</a>, so I was positive that we\'d get some good news about the next story update this time, and I was also hopeful that whatever they were going to announce about Galactic Season 9 was going to be more appealing to me than Season 8\'s uprising focus had been.

I made a whole <a href="https://youtu.be/7Wy2EA4fZrQ?si=CP0QdGpEjH5tDKy6&amp;t=144">compilation poking fun at people\'s urge to skip the cut scenes</a> <i>seven years ago</i>. I\'ve seen it all, from the guy who drops group the moment you zone into the Esseles or Black Talon, to endless arguments about who isn\'t hitting their space bar and why. It was a source of friction for sure.</p><p>AND YET. I myself have always loved the group conversations in flashpoints and was generally happy to watch cut scenes if other people wanted to do so too. I enjoy running flashpoints, but I never "spammed" them to the point where getting the Esseles again made me frustrated. (The only flashpoint that I\'ve managed to get utterly sick of is Hammer Station, and that has nothing to do with cut scenes and everything to do with the community.)</p><p>I also felt that the group conversations often inspired fun little interactions, such as when a dark or light side choice got people chatting. My guildies have seen me express (not-entirely-serious) outrage at killing the engineers or leaving Asara behind in the Esseles more than a few times. And some of the cut scenes also just genuinely looked nice! I have a whole collection of screenshots of pugs in Czerka Corporate Labs, from that last cut scene that shows your group walking into the room looking heroic.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s1741/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Four SWTOR characters about to face down the last boss in Czerka Corporate Labs.

Telling me that you can <i>technically</i> build a group manually and walk in to still see the cut scenes is a bit of a cold comfort because let\'s be real, how often do people do that? How often have you run Kuat Drive Yards since it was removed from the group finder? I just feel like this is going to be one of those things that will end up having negative ripple effects that people won\'t fully feel until later down the line. Or maybe I\'m just a relic of ancient times for having actually enjoyed interacting with my pug mates in small ways, even if there was friction sometimes.</p><p><b>Be free, F2P-ers!</b></p><p>A big change for free-to-play players that\'s coming with the next patch is that the devs will be dropping a <i>lot</i> of the old restrictions on that type of account. You will now also get sprint at level 1,&nbsp;have all action bars unlocked,&nbsp;be able to hide your head slot&nbsp; and equip random purples that you get while levelling. Honestly, with some of the things they mentioned I didn\'t even know there were restrictions for that: What, F2P players couldn\'t display legacy titles before? Or equip companion customisations? WTF?</p><p>Even as someone who\'s always been subscribed, I think this is great news. SWTOR has had a reputation for having extremely draconian F2P restrictions for a long time - I remember how the limited action bars were a source of ridicule across the entire MMO community when the game first went free-to-play. I think the devs did the right thing by being cautious when they first changed payment model back in the day (mostly because other MMOs that followed suit later and kept crowing about how much more generous their F2P model was in comparison, such as Rift and Wildstar, did ultimately not end up doing well).</p><p>However, all of that was over a decade ago, times have changed, and there\'s just no reason to be quite so brutal with all those restrictions on what\'s effectively the game\'s free trial mode. Annoying players with arbitrary feature locks before they\'ve even left the starter planet was just never great, and I hope that these changes will give more people a chance to actually fall in love with what the game has to offer and then spend some money on it happily instead of feeling nagged from the get-go.</p><p><b>What about subscribers though?</b></p><p>So as not to leave subscribers feeling unappreciated, the game will run a new "subscriber login event" from September to December where you\'ll earn a special currency if you log in at least four times a week, which you can then use to buy some goodies. I kinda raised my eyebrow a bit at one of those goodies supposedly being "endgame gear" but we\'ll see. I really don\'t need more free stuff myself, but I can\'t blame them for trying to offer subscribers a bit more carrot while easing up on the F2P stick.</p><p><b>Say farewell to endless free CC</b></p><p>Speaking of carrots and sticks, regardless of your subscription status, you\'ve long gained 100 free Cartel Coins per month if you\'ve got a security key attached to your account. I often saw delighted comments from people who came back to the game after some time away to find that they\'d accumulated thousands of free Cartel Coins while not playing. While that was nice, considering for how long the game has been running at this point, I can\'t blame the bean counters for concluding that someone coming back after years and immediately finding $40 worth of Cartel Coins in their account was maybe not so good for their bottom line. No, that free CC is not going to go away, but it will only be awarded going forward if your account was actually active in the last 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Decos, Graphics, DirectX</b></p><p>Under "other topics about which I don\'t have that much to say", we have the Feast of Prosperity returning this autumn with some awesome new decos that I\'ll definitely want to grind for. (I actually broke my habit of ignoring Twitch chat to type "LOVE LAMP" when they showed the new ceiling lights.)&nbsp;</p><p>The character customisation updates continue, with Rattataki getting updated textures next, and dark-side corruption getting a much-needed revamp so that it no longer turns every character into a pasty white dude regardless of their previous skin colour. (I might actually give showing it on my dark-siders a try once this goes live - I previously always disabled it precisely because it changed your skin colour <i>so</i> much and I didn\'t want to look like an albino axolotl.) Also, after they added all those skin colours for aliens in the last patch, they are expanding on this by adding more hair and montral colours with 7.7.1.</p><p>Finally, in technical news that I have to file under "I don\'t know enough about this to have an opinion but I guess it sounds good", they are making good progress on updating the game to DirectX 12 but there\'s still some work left to do.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, if you want ALL THE DEETS, including things I didn\'t mention here and images of various rewards, here are some other places you can look:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0E_bwCPnoM">VOD on YouTube</a> (Twitch had some hiccups and split it into several parts)&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/%5Bnews-category%5D/20250730">Official recap article</a></li><li><a href="https://swtorista.com/articles/what-to-expect-in-update-7-7-1-in-swtor-august-2025/">Swtorista</a></li><li><a href="https://todayintor.com/2025/06/28/swtor-7-7-1-update-news/">Today in TOR</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/07/some-interesting-news-from-swtors-771.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/07/some-interesting-news-from-swtors-771.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s72-w400-h249-c/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '10'}

I didn\'t mention it in those posts at the time, but one guildie who ended up popping a particularly large number of tokens to help us achieve victory admitted that she had used a character transfer to shuttle in extra Requisitions from another server, where she\'d been collecting them from her login rewards on the side.</p><p>Now, for additional context, my guild successfully conquered every single available planet at some point over the last decade - with one notable exception: Belsavis.

I\'m not sure why that is, but I can only guess that Belsavis might not come up as often in the rotation as other planets. A planet like Tatooine for example is tied to the Death Mark Conquest event, which in turn is tied to Bounty Contract Week and comes around once a month.

We had a lot of Requisitions saved up, but not <i>that</i> many.</p><p>Anyway, last week\'s Total Galactic War arrived and the matter was brought up again. Looking at the scoreboard, all the biggest guilds had committed early for a change, and the guild in the lead on Belsavis was none other than our frenemies the Czech Empire. They were not a top five guild, and <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/04/at-token-war-with-czech-empire.html">we\'d beaten them before</a>... but it had also been the fight of a lifetime, and they were the reason we were so acutely aware of the power of Personal Conquest Requisitions in the first place, so there was no chance that we\'d be able to surprise them.</p><p>I quickly had a look at possible alternative invasion targets (that we had conquered in the past but that newer members would\'ve liked us to conquer again) but nothing stood out as an easy or obvious option, so after a bit of deliberation I decided to commit us to Belsavis. We agreed that we\'d hold off on using any tokens for now and that we\'d play it by ear, deciding our next steps later in the week depending on how it went.</p><p>Interestingly, it went quite differently than a year ago. Back then, we\'d overtaken the Czechs quickly, and they\'d been quite happy to trail us for the rest of the week with a steady ten million point gap between us. This time, they\'d clearly made a push on launch day to get a solid lead from the beginning, and they did not want us to catch them. We were about three million behind by the end of the first day and I figured that this was a difference we should be able to make up quickly enough, but <i>somehow</i> we couldn\'t quite get there. In fact, by Thursday morning the Czechs had grown their lead to seven million, and by evening we were <i>sixteen</i> million points behind them.</p><p>There was a time when being that far behind would\'ve been reason enough for us to fold, but I knew that the game wasn\'t quite over yet this time, as the other Conquest guy and I - <i>if</i> we went ahead with the server transfers - would have over 50 million points in tokens at our disposal. We did discuss amongst ourselves that if they kept gaining points at the same rate we\'d likely have to give up, but for the time being, we kept going.</p><p>Even though I knew that we had a plan, it was honestly a bit demotivating to keep grinding away when we were so far behind. I heard more than one defeatist comment from guildies but still did my best to counter the psychological warfare. I basically told everyone that we\'d let them know once the battle was lost, but as of now it wasn\'t over yet and they just had to trust me and keep going. (People knew about the saved up Conquest Requisitions, but I didn\'t tell anyone outside the leadership circle about the exact numbers since we\'re not very strict about removing people from our Discord for inactivity, and I was paranoid about information getting leaked to the competition somehow.)</p><p>And it seemed to work! While people weren\'t necessarily in the best of spirits, they kept at it. At its worst, the Czech\'s lead grew to around 18 million points, but they only maintained that for a brief while and most of the time the gap between us seemed to hover between ten and sixteen million.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/s1920/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot of a party fighting the last boss in the Landing Party uprising" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/w400-h225/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Then the weekend came and with it a sudden and unexpected burst of energy. (I think I\'m actually starting to notice a trend here, that my guild is better at Conquest in the second half of the week than in the first half.)</p><p>An officer that had been on hiatus for months popped his head in the door, asked how Total Galactic War was going and quickly ground out a half-million points in one evening. Another guild member who hasn\'t really been playing SWTOR in a while piped up to say that he had the week off and fancied randomly lending us a hand with grinding points. The funniest moment to me personally was when another guy who hadn\'t logged in in months showed up on Monday evening and we had a conversation that went something like this (paraphrased):</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Me: Look at you, logging in for the first time since the last Total Galactic War! [I could tell because on log-in he triggered the "Conqueror of Oricon" achievement.]</li><li>Him: Hah, you got me there. Would you like me to pop some tokens?</li><li>Me: How do you even have any? You haven\'t been online and you said you popped them all last time.</li><li>Him: Oops, I guess I lied.</li></ul><p>All of Sunday afternoon and evening the guild was absolutely buzzing with activity and achievements were popping left and right as people went out of their comfort zone and tried content they hadn\'t done before in order to earn Conquest points. Guild PvP was more active than it had been in months and there was plenty of banter. Point gains aside, it was a joy to see.</p><p>We could see that the Czechs were active in the evening and trying to bolster their score with some planetary rampaging, but we actually had a similar number of people online and were absolutely on fire. By the end of the evening, the gap between us was down to less than ten million.</p><p>I expected Monday to be more quiet, so I was both pleasantly surprised and had a good laugh when I decided to do a quick check-in on Monday morning and saw seven people online in guild. Clearly our members were less constrained by work than I\'d expected.</p><p>We continued Sunday\'s trend at a slightly slower pace and the gap between us and first place continued to shrink all day. By the time the last person went to bed we were only about a million points behind.</p><p>Tuesday I was working from home and I had put a bit of time aside around the end of Conquest to pop my Personal Conquest Requisitions as needed. I had transferred four characters to Darth Malgus the day before (my first character transfers ever) and now held 182 tokens in my inventory and cargo hold. Several other people were online and trying to earn some last-minute points while buzzing with excitement. We were pretty much neck on neck with the Czechs, but still always about a million behind.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/s1920/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot showing my character\'s inventory and an entire cargo bay filled with Personal Conquest Requisitions" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/w400-h225/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>With eight minutes to go on the timer, I decided to start clicking my Requisitions. I\'d told myself that I wasn\'t even going to look at the score, but was just going to keep popping the tokens. We didn\'t really care about overshooting and wasting points, as for us, this was the fight to end all fights. We wanted Belsavis and winning it was all that mattered.</p><p>While I wasn\'t looking at the board, other guildies were, and I was cracking up as several complained about their scoreboard going blank at some point. I\'d like to think that we were pumping so many points into the system that we temporarily overloaded it. Anyway, it turned out that apparently the Czechs did not have a counter to a big final push this time, so I saw guildies cry out "twelve million ahead", "twenty million", "thirty million", "they are not doing anything" and: "Are you still clicking, guys?"&nbsp;</p><p>I eventually stopped with about twenty tokens left in my inventory, though my fellow Conquest buddy used up every last one of his. It had been overkill indeed, as the final scoreboard showed us more than fifty million points ahead of the competition. But it was definitely worth it, as Twin Suns Squadron owned Belsavis at last, earning several of us the "Galaxy Conqueror" legacy title. I think I mentioned before that this isn\'t actually something that\'s hard to get if you simply join a large guild that wins a lot without even trying - it\'s how I got the title on the Shae Vizla server myself. But to have earned it in a smaller guild with hard work and communal effort, over the course of over a decade, that felt pretty good.</p><p>We wondered a bit why the Czechs folded as soon as we started our final offensive, and we can only guess that since the "surprise attack coming from behind" didn\'t work for them last time, they frontloaded more of their efforts (including token pops) this time in order to stay in first place from the beginning (and hopefully demotivate us). They probably didn\'t know that this exact strategy <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/12/living-degen-conquest-life.html">had failed Ace of Saints against us back in December</a> as well, but that\'s how it goes.</p><p>I almost want to say that I feel like I can retire from Conquest, now that I\'ve finally achieved it all, but I honestly enjoy it too much to just give up on it I think. However, any future planetary conquests for newer members admittedly won\'t quite carry the same weight or garner the same amount of excitement as this one did.&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>Last week it was once again time for Total Galactic War.

Point gains aside, it was a joy to see.</p><p>We could see that the Czechs were active in the evening and trying to bolster their score with some planetary rampaging, but we actually had a similar number of people online and were absolutely on fire. By the end of the evening, the gap between us was down to less than ten million.</p><p>I expected Monday to be more quiet, so I was both pleasantly surprised and had a good laugh when I decided to do a quick check-in on Monday morning and saw seven people online in guild. Clearly our members were less constrained by work than I\'d expected.</p><p>We continued Sunday\'s trend at a slightly slower pace and the gap between us and first place continued to shrink all day. By the time the last person went to bed we were only about a million points behind.</p><p>Tuesday I was working from home and I had put a bit of time aside around the end of Conquest to pop my Personal Conquest Requisitions as needed. I had transferred four characters to Darth Malgus the day before (my first character transfers ever) and now held 182 tokens in my inventory and cargo hold. Several other people were online and trying to earn some last-minute points while buzzing with excitement. We were pretty much neck on neck with the Czechs, but still always about a million behind.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/s1920/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot showing my character\'s inventory and an entire cargo bay filled with Personal Conquest Requisitions" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHt9Tz-Tpylp2nX990vx0KagOds2O8S-jU0QoHavflwPU-V0_2YSo09QsuqTPQspPB7CwVft1n8HGmWW3ftX_MTvZE3piehe2DJoeILXl7hy5rWjSSf6Lt6ighWylyT7SJ-MVi3bu38iGVmkU5mAkv_rpGzvYPsC_aDbeALFdoDjaHa1lB2HbR3W6g1Qc/w400-h225/Golu\'s%20inventory%20full%20of%20Personal%20Conquest%20Requisitions.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>With eight minutes to go on the timer, I decided to start clicking my Requisitions. I\'d told myself that I wasn\'t even going to look at the score, but was just going to keep popping the tokens. We didn\'t really care about overshooting and wasting points, as for us, this was the fight to end all fights. We wanted Belsavis and winning it was all that mattered.</p><p>While I wasn\'t looking at the board, other guildies were, and I was cracking up as several complained about their scoreboard going blank at some point. I\'d like to think that we were pumping so many points into the system that we temporarily overloaded it. Anyway, it turned out that apparently the Czechs did not have a counter to a big final push this time, so I saw guildies cry out "twelve million ahead", "twenty million", "thirty million", "they are not doing anything" and: "Are you still clicking, guys?"&nbsp;</p><p>I eventually stopped with about twenty tokens left in my inventory, though my fellow Conquest buddy used up every last one of his. It had been overkill indeed, as the final scoreboard showed us more than fifty million points ahead of the competition. But it was definitely worth it, as Twin Suns Squadron owned Belsavis at last, earning several of us the "Galaxy Conqueror" legacy title. I think I mentioned before that this isn\'t actually something that\'s hard to get if you simply join a large guild that wins a lot without even trying - it\'s how I got the title on the Shae Vizla server myself. But to have earned it in a smaller guild with hard work and communal effort, over the course of over a decade, that felt pretty good.</p><p>We wondered a bit why the Czechs folded as soon as we started our final offensive, and we can only guess that since the "surprise attack coming from behind" didn\'t work for them last time, they frontloaded more of their efforts (including token pops) this time in order to stay in first place from the beginning (and hopefully demotivate us). They probably didn\'t know that this exact strategy <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/12/living-degen-conquest-life.html">had failed Ace of Saints against us back in December</a> as well, but that\'s how it goes.</p><p>I almost want to say that I feel like I can retire from Conquest, now that I\'ve finally achieved it all, but I honestly enjoy it too much to just give up on it I think. However, any future planetary conquests for newer members admittedly won\'t quite carry the same weight or garner the same amount of excitement as this one did.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/06/conquest-of-parison-planet.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/06/conquest-of-parison-planet.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiynfkO8DKwSt-WV0hG4eCNCQHK67LN3Ciwtoh_E47mPQ0n_VffdqsaVZl_Vz8lh2fdaky2xqnWCnUA274GdLMzvzara6euEjX0vMSXG2poRELBn718-BblOF9zy1fTUKadZu0EaIxcDhIrueM9ZWualWypASkgD0GKjP8-2ZObDy0dB9Q4zPLZ_J-e3EY/s72-w400-h225-c/Shintar%20on%20Belsavis%20with%20Galaxy%20Conqueror%20legacy%20title.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '5'}

This makes sense in so far as they fill a similar niche and the DEs were the new hotness, but it also meant that what previously made this objective so much fun to do - that it was so varied in its locations and could be done in a number of different ways - was kind of lost as we were just stuck on either Tatooine or Hoth week after week.</p><p>We\'ll see how they\'ll handle this in future seasons, but I think my personal preference would be if they simply merged the two types of objectives together, into something like "Complete Dynamic Encounters, Repeatable, Exploration, or Bonus Missions while defeating enemies on Coruscant or Dromund Kaas", therefore restoring the "rotating between different planets" aspect while also including dynamic encounters in the mix.</p><p>Still, I\'ve got to admit I\'m going to try and temper my expectations for whenever they announce Galactic Season 9, because I\'m definitely a bit bored of the repetition and lack of even small bits of newness at this point.

I think most raiders would posit that for them, raiding is about some sort of progression: seeing the content, beating the challenge, getting the gear... and once you\'ve hit your goal, you move on.</p><p>SWTOR doesn\'t really support that kind of attitude towards raiding anymore, or at least not if you\'re a long-term player. If you\'re coming to the game completely fresh, there\'s plenty to do and many encounters to work your way through, thanks to scaling keeping all the old content relevant, but new operations come out way too infrequently to keep existing players busy for very long.</p><p>I sometimes find myself wondering why I\'m still so focused on that part of the game after more than a decade to be honest. I\'ve seen all there is to see, many times, and while my skill at the game has improved over the years from sheer repetition, if I haven\'t been able to beat a higher-difficulty encounter that\'s been in the game for over a decade at this point, I\'m not holding my breath that it\'s still going to happen.</p><p>I guess it\'s just a habit, a way of hanging out a few times a week, and the fact that Mr Commando and I do it together has led to a sort of feedback loop where we keep each other going even if one person\'s interest flags at some point.</p><p>That said, there\'s been turnover in the people we raid <i>with</i> over the years, and every now and then we\'ll get some fresh faces who haven\'t yet seen it all and who\'ll be excited to tackle this or that operation for the first time, and I\'ll be like "sure", because what else am I going to suggest?</p><p>In line with that we cleared Dread Palace master mode again a couple of months ago, and it actually went so quickly and smoothly (considering that some people had never done it before), that I found myself daring to hope for some personal progression for the first time in a while, because I\'d never gotten the achievement for the timed run, which requires you to clear the instance within an hour.</p><p>Everyone was game for working on it, so we kept going back every week, just to get better at the fights and progress that little bit more quickly, with fewer wipes along the way. Progression was far from smooth, as some nights would see us one-shot the first four bosses in a timely manner just to keep failing on the final Council fight, while on others, we would mess up repeatedly at the very beginning and then never even finish the instance.</p><p>However, improvement did happen, and this Wednesday we finally got there. We were actually off to a very bad start at first and wiped twice on the very first encounter.

I think most raiders would posit that for them, raiding is about some sort of progression: seeing the content, beating the challenge, getting the gear... and once you\'ve hit your goal, you move on.</p><p>SWTOR doesn\'t really support that kind of attitude towards raiding anymore, or at least not if you\'re a long-term player. If you\'re coming to the game completely fresh, there\'s plenty to do and many encounters to work your way through, thanks to scaling keeping all the old content relevant, but new operations come out way too infrequently to keep existing players busy for very long.</p><p>I sometimes find myself wondering why I\'m still so focused on that part of the game after more than a decade to be honest. I\'ve seen all there is to see, many times, and while my skill at the game has improved over the years from sheer repetition, if I haven\'t been able to beat a higher-difficulty encounter that\'s been in the game for over a decade at this point, I\'m not holding my breath that it\'s still going to happen.</p><p>I guess it\'s just a habit, a way of hanging out a few times a week, and the fact that Mr Commando and I do it together has led to a sort of feedback loop where we keep each other going even if one person\'s interest flags at some point.</p><p>That said, there\'s been turnover in the people we raid <i>with</i> over the years, and every now and then we\'ll get some fresh faces who haven\'t yet seen it all and who\'ll be excited to tackle this or that operation for the first time, and I\'ll be like "sure", because what else am I going to suggest?</p><p>In line with that we cleared Dread Palace master mode again a couple of months ago, and it actually went so quickly and smoothly (considering that some people had never done it before), that I found myself daring to hope for some personal progression for the first time in a while, because I\'d never gotten the achievement for the timed run, which requires you to clear the instance within an hour.</p><p>Everyone was game for working on it, so we kept going back every week, just to get better at the fights and progress that little bit more quickly, with fewer wipes along the way. Progression was far from smooth, as some nights would see us one-shot the first four bosses in a timely manner just to keep failing on the final Council fight, while on others, we would mess up repeatedly at the very beginning and then never even finish the instance.</p><p>However, improvement did happen, and this Wednesday we finally got there. We were actually off to a very bad start at first and wiped twice on the very first encounter.
