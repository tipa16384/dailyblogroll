But I know, beyond any shadow of doubt, if I start down that path Time to Loot would leap from &#8216;all but over&#8217; to &#8216;actually over&#8217;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lack of steam or no, I&#8217;m not quite ready for that!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the decompressing post Blaugust, it has also been a rather busy period at work, with travel, updating the strategic outlook through to 2030 and the tactical level realignment that goes on in the wake of a new strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably more than any of that, <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/">I gained firsthand understanding</a> of why <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/">Bhagpuss</a> has found <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a> has encroached so much on gaming and TV time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suno&#8217;s version 5 model landed this month, mostly calling out clearer vocals and richer sound. Having been playing with &#8216;v4.5+&#8217; beta model before the release, which I have to imagine is essentially the training set for v5, I&#8217;d be lying if I said I noted a significant difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Possibly</em> Suno is a little better at following the in-line lyric style and instrumentation guides given, but hard to be sure given the variances you can get in generation to generation even against the same exact prompts, guides, and &#8216;advanced settings&#8217;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gained access to <a href="https://suno.com/studio-welcome">Suno Studio</a> this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65692" height="517" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-940x517.png" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> RIP free time.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked with Studio on a few songs now, it definitely has a lot of potential, but for my use case and at least currently, carries an equally high number of frustrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of them coming from the fact that &#8216;stem&#8217; extraction is fairly hit and miss, and can introduce sound artifacts that didn&#8217;t exist in the original generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When all I&#8217;m wanting to achieve is to tweak the per-instrument positioning on the sound stage, it&#8217;s fairly irksome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those using it in probably the more &#8216;proper&#8217; fashion, and creating elements from the ground up, I have to imagine it&#8217;s already quite the power house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, moving on to actual games!

Mostly prompted by curiosity as to what  Benedict Jacka had got up to since finishing his <em><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/books/reviews/book-review-risen-by-benedict-jacka/">Alex Verus</a></em> series. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His new series, <em>Inheritance of Magic</em>, seems good! Good enough, anyway, that I pre-ordered the third book for Kindle and wish that I&#8217;d waited a little longer before this particular spot of curiosity struck, as there is going to be a lot of waiting to see this series unfold!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Dan Willis&#8217; <em>Arcane Casebook</em> series to fill the gap. I&#8217;m through two of the five books in the bundle I bought already, and I can tell I&#8217;ll be getting the rest. It&#8217;s a bit of an interesting spin on the genre, too, being set in &#8216;Depression era&#8217; New York, but where magic of various forms has taken the place of certain aspects of technology developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m torn on having Goodreads count it as a single book though. It&#8217;s >1,800 pages for the five books, which is not out of the question but certainly on the longer end of my typical books, but each individual book is shorter than my typical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still- I think I&#8217;ll hit my 15 book target easily enough even counting it as just the one, so eh! :)</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-september-2025/">Time to Loot Journal: September 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com">Time to Loot</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/journal/time-to-loot-journal-september-2025/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2', 'post-id': '65691'}

Finding music that resonates with the soul, or at least the big feelings of the moment, is cathartic in a way almost nothing else can be. Even if it does take a bit of mental gymnastics to make every line fit your situation sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a>. You may&#8217;ve heard of it &#8212; but if not, it&#8217;s an AI that can create songs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d heard of it before. But honestly? I had simply assumed it&#8217;d be little more than a toy. Somewhere along the line I got the idea you had to provide your own vocals, and the AI just acted like a souped-up auto-tune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>can</em> use it like that, sure. But you can also simply write your own lyrics and have it go at it. Heck &#8212; if you&#8217;d rather, you don&#8217;t even need to do that. Just describe what you want, like any other LLM, and it&#8217;ll spit out your response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only this time it comes with a soundtrack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://suno.com/s/YfVE4FBgRpdZWnZF"><em>Shadows and Neon</em></a> is one such created in this way. I could not have expended any less effort on it if I <em>tried</em>. I can&#8217;t even recall what my prompt was, but I know I didn&#8217;t even bother prompting for specific styles. I just wasn&#8217;t invested yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it made me sit up and pay attention because I couldn&#8217;t hand on heart tell you I&#8217;d definitely have identified it as AI-generated if I hadn&#8217;t just clicked the &#8216;Create&#8217; button myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thus Starts my Crash Course in Song Construction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I <em>like</em> music, I couldn&#8217;t have told you a few days ago what a &#8216;prechorus&#8217; was (beyond the obvious), or what precisely a &#8216;bridge&#8217; is meant to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of this learning was just feeding in basic prompts and seeing what came out, but I also took a bit of a stab at seeing if I knew enough to take inspiration from other, much better, songs and seeing if Suno could get me anywhere close. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was even reading song and album reviews for crying out loud. It was a bit like learning a new language adjacent to, but not quite the same as the one you&#8217;re native to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/jJSVX5qAs2KcYbK6">What Never Relents</a></em> is one such attempt, where I was looking to see if I could craft a style prompt to hit a similar feel to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUe9UhcUtEI">Specter by Bad Omens</a></em>. It does tickle me that the generated lyrics here used &#8216;Specter&#8217; without specifically being prompted to or given the lyric directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not an unqualified success (particularly not on the vocal stylings), I was, once again, somewhat impressed.

Don’t ask me how or why &#8212; I couldn’t tell you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I do know is that I realised I’d still been treating Suno as a toy, when it was clearly more than that. So… I did something I haven’t done in <em>many</em> years.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-2-65184"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65184" title="Probably not since I was that rock-bashing cave-teen myself."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote something like poetry — only this time, I had a way to give it a soundtrack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we call those songs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because she’d been on my mind a lot lately, I wrote one about my mother. Let me tell you &#8212; I was <em>not</em> ready to hear the words sung back at me. Jesus H. Christ. I&#8217;m uncertain what context to give. Perhaps none, and leave it to what I&#8217;ve already <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/goodbye-mum/">said in the past</a>. Songs are meant to speak for themselves anyway, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hit me harder than I expected. Harder than I was ready for. And yet, I kept working on it. It took a fair bit of finessing of lyrics and style guides to get where I wanted it &#8212; and Suno really does not like being told what to do if you introduce the concept of a second voice &#8212; but I ultimately found my way to this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/zQ6jTxGIw1ClJRnT">The Weight of Love</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s still a sombre piece overall, the more I tweaked, the more small notes of light started slipping in. Verse 3, for example, wasn’t in the first draft at all &#8212; it only emerged as I kept writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, for starters, I think I finally get why some albums feel like they’re circling one idea over and over. Apparently, when something matters, you don’t just&#8230; wring it out in a single track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So of course I had to do another. I had more work through here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just like that, I think I&#8217;m on the path to just creating a whole (virtual) album. Whodathunk? Certainly not me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not blind to the issues such AI technologies pose, whichever side of the fence you sit on. I can&#8217;t say I know how ethically the models have been trained (but&#8230; I could guess). Nor do I relish a future where the world is drowning in &#8216;AI Slop&#8217; in the music field as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the transition of considering Suno from Toy to Therapist is perhaps telling of my perspective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to spell it out; I don’t think anything I make with it should soar to the top of the charts, or replace the work of genuinely talented artists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as something personal — a way to process, to experiment, to speak feelings I’d struggle to put into words otherwise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s powerful stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first cave-teenager banged rocks together to make sense of big feelings. I guess I’m doing the same, only now the rocks have been swapped for an algorithm and a pair of headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bonus Track</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href="https://suno.com/s/hjZv4nd55jkbFif0">Remember Me (That Way)</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second (made, but maybe not in final placement) track from this hypothetical album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honouring Mum&#8217;s request for how she wished to be remembered &#8212; but without burying the truth for those left behind, either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a trickier one to land, asking Suno to balance minor and major sections to hit the right overall tone. Last night I was <em>just about</em> ready to come to the conclusion Suno simply couldn&#8217;t do it. After changing my approach to the in-lyric style notes and the main style guide, here we go!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/">Accidentally, Songs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com">Time to Loot</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.timetoloot.com/other/accidentally-songs/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'post-id': '65184'}

It no longer asked the reader to think through implications and parallels for themselves and instead became a mallet to the face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strength of fiction, done well, is that whole stimulation of thought. Creating (or perhaps more accurately, finding) the links for yourself.

It&#8217;s the <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/youd-never-guess-but/">plan</a> anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/other-games/screenshot-saturday-deadzone-rogue/">Last week</a>, I did Deadzone: Rogue; so I probably won&#8217;t do that one again. Beyond that though the decision gets a fair bit trickier. Both FFXIV and Wuthering Waves are doing their darndest to be the one. Wuthering Waves had its 2.6 patch this week, with a character banner I was actually interested in<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-3-65003"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/wuthering-waves/screenshot-saturday-wuthering-waves-2-6-edition/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-65003" title="I haven&amp;#8217;t gone for anyone since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D9K2rz3Uvk&quot;&gt;Cartethyia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=optr9r9VkoQ&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;)"><sup>3</sup></a></span> and what looks to be a finale-feeling storyline for the Rinascita story arc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Although it is possible, actually, that this trailer is representing more than just 2.6. Perhaps a 2.7 is in our future to close out Rinascita. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know yet because I haven&#8217;t actually <em>started</em> the 2.6 Main Story Quest yet, let alone finished it. Actually- that&#8217;s not 100% true. I have done the preamble/character introduction bits, but then paused just shy of getting started <em>properly</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead I&#8217;ve caught up on the Overture quest from 2.5, which, come to think of it, is pretty similar in nature to the between-expansion quest lines of FFXIV. Just&#8230; <em>much</em> shorter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; Alright, I&#8217;ve gone on this long. I was going to outline the case for FFXIV before deciding, but perhaps that can just occupy next week&#8217;s slot! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-columns wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65007" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250828220450_2-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Won Augusta 1st night of the patch!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-65008" height="393" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250830020819_1-940x393.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Did <em>not</em> win weapon first night.

I had things to do. &#8230; Thing to do. <em>Alright, geez,</em> I had a game to play. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have our own motivations, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonight I don&#8217;t have quite the same need. I made it through the end of Heavensward, hit credits (<a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/final-fantasy-xiv/rolling-credits-on-heavensward/">again</a>), and got the Stormblood title drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-64967" height="529" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250827233112_1-940x529.jpg" width="940" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV:</em></strong> Passing the Wall, into all new lands.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, I lied, I do have the same need. I want to play more. The start of Stormblood is great so far. Plus! I now know who the lady in red in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt1h1MinlLI">Stormblood trailer</a> is! All these years, and I just assumed she was a class trainer from the expansion. Eesh!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. I&#8217;m getting distracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; If focus is the key, I might be in trouble. ! <em>Althooough</em>, I got distracted <em>while</em> writing this time. So I&#8217;m going to call that progress. Surely it&#8217;s better than stopping mid-post to reply in Discord or Google some random thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I think it might be actually, is channelling that&#8230; <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/writing-comments-vs-posts/">comment writing energy</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The linked post goes into more detail, but as a brief recap if you haven&#8217;t the foggiest what I mean&#8230; Something that&#8217;s true for me, and others, and maybe you&#8217;ll recognise it as well after I explain it, is that writing a post&#8230; Man, that&#8217;s <em>work</em>. It takes time. Serious time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments though? Even if they end up being post-length in nature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Easy</em>. They just flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a whole other part of your brain gets engaged. Or&#8230; Perhaps more accurate to say that in &#8216;comment&#8217; writing, a part of your brain <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> get engaged. Namely, the critic. The editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All to say, I found Wilhelm&#8217;s post today both incredibly timely, <em>and</em> incredibly enlightening, <em>and</em> amusing to boot.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>Basically, the secret to my success is low standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8211; Wilhelm Arcturis (2025), <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/08/27/blaugust-motivation-where-do-all-these-words-come-from/">Blaugust Motivation – Where Do All These Words Come&nbsp;From?</a> (The Ancient Gaming Noob)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And I should also add: accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should take the time to read the post yourself, so I don&#8217;t want to give it all away &#8212; but one last part I can&#8217;t help but to voice agreement with. I have the time to blog more. Write more. It is absolutely a choice to prioritise other pursuits (*cough* games) more often than not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps if I consciously leaned into this style more often, I could have my cake and eat it too&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;Thoughts for another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Games await.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Full List of Blaugust 2025 Participants</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/other/blaugust-2025-is-here/">little while</a> since I posted the list of Blaugust participants. The numbers have grown over the course of the month, too!

And if you look at it funny and kinda squint a little bit, you might stretch me to two and a quarter. Maybe even two and a half &#8212; as the missing game I <em>had</em> played before, at its PlayStation release. I just thought I might pick it up again on PC, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong> is, frankly, amazing. The gameplay trailers we saw in the four years of development often seemed as if coming directly from a game designer&#8217;s fever dream.

Turns out, there <em>was</em> a reason my friends and I have played through all three Borderlands games to date, sometimes multiple times! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was with that lens some of the gameplay coming out from content creators grabbed my attention a bunch more, and here we are, considering prioritising it against even Hollow Knight: Silksong!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Battlefield 6 &#8212; 11 October</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/game/other-games/battlefield-6-open-beta/">The beta</a> was enough to convince my friend group that we want in.

What I didn&#8217;t appreciate until quite recently is that it isn&#8217;t just a Singleplayer game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is there co-op, but you can even (optionally) go into a full &#8216;Online&#8217; mode where it is more of an MMO-lite, with world events/bosses, and the whole nine yards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh- it&#8217;s also free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which can be boon or bane; but at least how the devs are talking now &#8212; the monetisation seems restricted to cosmetics only. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a slew of sponsored videos like this one, where there is clearly a desire to build interest in the West before the release later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is coming across as a bit of an &#8216;everything to everyone&#8217; game at the moment, which again&#8230; Could be concerning.

Because I <em>thought</em> it was a simple DPS race (I was <em>very</em> close to achieving it this way), but I was underestimating the game again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a mechanic there which needed to be respected.

There is a double standard at play there. But this time, one <em>against</em> rather than for myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <em>other</em> people post short posts &#8212; it&#8217;s fine.

They keep you pushing, keep you improving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But stack too many on top of yourself, and suddenly you’re not climbing higher &#8212; you’re just weighed down. And even when you <em>know</em> others would enjoy the same change-up from you that you enjoy from them, it’s hard to let yourself off the hook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>can</em> though. Hell, you <em>should</em>. Recognising when you&#8217;re holding these double standards against yourself is important. Even if not all the time, then just&#8230; Every once in a while, cut yourself some slack in order to do something a little off the beaten path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Variety isn’t just the spice of life, it&#8217;s also the secret ingredient in keeping your motivation to blog high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230; And now I kinda want some KFC&#8230; </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Older Posts on Motivation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a topic that comes up with some regularity here, not least because all these years on, I&#8217;m somewhat shocked I haven&#8217;t fully lost it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t my <a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/somethings-different-here/">first time blogging</a>, after all!

You can find it as you go. But it is important to recognise your motivation <em>is</em> a &#8216;why&#8217;, and not a &#8216;what&#8217;. (Generally.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href="https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/staying-motivated/">Staying Motivated</a></strong> &#8212; may involve a degree of change!

Cyberpunk 2077, for all its launch faults, is in fine form now. It wasn&#8217;t abandoned or given bare minimum technical touch-ups. Instead, it had literal <em>years</em> of additional development effort put in to make it sing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bring it up in the context of a brilliant post by <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/">Frostilyte</a>, asking the question: &#8220;<a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/18/is-it-wrong-to-support-grounded-2-in-early-access/">Should <em>Grounded 2</em> even be <em>allowed</em> to utilise <em>Early Access</em>?</a>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My title probably spoils this, but: <em><strong>yes</strong></em>. Not only <em>should</em> Grounded 2 be &#8216;allowed,&#8217; I wish more big titles had the guts to wear the Early Access label when it fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyberpunk sure should have. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, gamers were left feeling anything &#8212; or everything &#8212; from frustration to disappointment, or even betrayal. Slap the EA badge on it and suddenly? The consumer transparency preserves a mountain of goodwill and space to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281" height="461" src="https://www.timetoloot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190826000049_1-830x461.jpg" width="830" /><button class="lightbox-trigger" type="button">\n\t\t\t<svg fill="none" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\n\t\t\t\t<path d="M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z" fill="#fff">\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>No Man&#8217;s Sky</em></strong>: Another example where the &#8216;Early Access&#8217; tag really should&#8217;ve been applied.

Although I would hope not a controversial one: <em>If, for whatever reason, you&#8217;re not going to finish the game before putting it out, maybe at least be honest about this fact.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Frostilyte had more than just us consumers in mind.

AAA&#8217;s adopting &#8216;Early Access&#8217; doesn&#8217;t materially change things for the worse, and in fact, there is an argument to be made that says such a move would further legitimise &#8216;Early Access&#8217; and broaden the range of people willing to try it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><strong>What even is an &#8216;Indie&#8217; anyway?</strong><br />The term covers a vast spectrum, from the solo dev mortgaging their house we mentioned, to &#8216;indie elites&#8217; like Supergiant, Team Cherry, or Larian, pulling in millions with sizable teams.

Getting in at the ground floor on a Paradox game is generally a good idea if you want to have any hope of learning the game in question without reliance on extensive &#8216;let&#8217;s play&#8217; styled tutorial videos. xD</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Silent Hill <em>f</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230; <em>think</em>&#8230; I&#8217;m interested?

Said mention? Just a sole entry logging ~5 hours of play time, and that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll say now what I didn&#8217;t say then: I <em>loved</em> almost everything about my time with Enshrouded, even at that early point (which must&#8217;ve basically been at release).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was just one disappointing factor for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In multiplayer, the quest state is (was? I should look into this) determined by the world state. And not just for things where maybe it makes sense (e.g., rescuing an NPC) but for <em>everything</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you, as I do, prefer to have independent bases *in addition* to the more communal setup&#8211; so far as the quests are concerned anyway, too bad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is absolutely a nitpick, and even if that is unchanged, the look of this update, let alone whatever may have come up to this point, might be the point at which I let it go and jump back in regardless.

I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb and suggest there probably won&#8217;t be as long of a wait this time around, assuming a lot of technology (and perhaps even asset) re-use from Wukong.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vampire: the Masquerade -Bloodlines 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno about this one anymore.

Which is a shame, as this occupied the #1 spot on my Steam wishlist for probably a good few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess I might be listing it here now more out of morbid curiosity than anything else.

Sales on some of my servers have been incredibly low, and if I put those items up on my more populated servers instead I&#8217;m sure I can get them to move faster.

This is unusual as generally, large companies strive for the opposite, to go public. You hear about things going the other way a lot less often, never mind with such a large sum of money changing hands.</p><p>I wasn\'t sure whether I should write about this on the blog because I\'m not really an expert on all this business stuff. People who seem more knowledgeable on the subject mostly seem to think that this will enrich a certain number of individuals while ultimately being bad for EA itself, likely leading to a lot of lay-offs and perhaps even bankruptcy further down the line. So not great news for fans of Bioware games and the like.</p><p>However, many of the comments I\'ve read on social media about how this is likely to affect SWTOR have been so utterly hyperbolic and divorced from reality, I feel we need to clarify some things. Remember, The Old Republic is NOT a Bioware game anymore, not in the technical sense anyway.&nbsp;<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/annnd-its-official.html" target="_blank">It\'s being developed by Broadsword</a>!</p><p>Also, if you read the article linked at the top, the transaction "is expected to close in Q1 FY27" so nothing\'s happening as a result of this for at least another year.</p><p>Whatever <i>is</i> going to happen as the result of this buyout eventually, I do not believe we have reason to worry about SWTOR in specific. Keep in mind that SWTOR isn\'t something that EA wholly owns; it\'s a collaborative project between Disney, Broadsword and EA.</p><p>Disney may be making the smallest contribution at this point (unless they are secretly responsible for a lot of the investment in the game) but they are actually the ones with the ultimate power due to owning the Star Wars IP. They could theoretically cause the game to shut down at any time by saying "we no longer want this to represent Star Wars" and that would be it. You can\'t take the Star Wars out of SWTOR and still have a game. This seems unlikely to be a problem though as based on various dev interviews, the Disney peeps seem to love the game and are quite happy with the work the devs have been doing with it.</p><p>The interaction between Broadsword and EA is a lot less clear. Unlike Bioware, Broadsword as a studio is not <i>owned</i> by EA, however EA still serves as SWTOR\'s publisher.

This is unusual as generally, large companies strive for the opposite, to go public. You hear about things going the other way a lot less often, never mind with such a large sum of money changing hands.</p><p>I wasn\'t sure whether I should write about this on the blog because I\'m not really an expert on all this business stuff. People who seem more knowledgeable on the subject mostly seem to think that this will enrich a certain number of individuals while ultimately being bad for EA itself, likely leading to a lot of lay-offs and perhaps even bankruptcy further down the line. So not great news for fans of Bioware games and the like.</p><p>However, many of the comments I\'ve read on social media about how this is likely to affect SWTOR have been so utterly hyperbolic and divorced from reality, I feel we need to clarify some things. Remember, The Old Republic is NOT a Bioware game anymore, not in the technical sense anyway.&nbsp;<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/annnd-its-official.html" target="_blank">It\'s being developed by Broadsword</a>!</p><p>Also, if you read the article linked at the top, the transaction "is expected to close in Q1 FY27" so nothing\'s happening as a result of this for at least another year.</p><p>Whatever <i>is</i> going to happen as the result of this buyout eventually, I do not believe we have reason to worry about SWTOR in specific. Keep in mind that SWTOR isn\'t something that EA wholly owns; it\'s a collaborative project between Disney, Broadsword and EA.</p><p>Disney may be making the smallest contribution at this point (unless they are secretly responsible for a lot of the investment in the game) but they are actually the ones with the ultimate power due to owning the Star Wars IP. They could theoretically cause the game to shut down at any time by saying "we no longer want this to represent Star Wars" and that would be it. You can\'t take the Star Wars out of SWTOR and still have a game. This seems unlikely to be a problem though as based on various dev interviews, the Disney peeps seem to love the game and are quite happy with the work the devs have been doing with it.</p><p>The interaction between Broadsword and EA is a lot less clear. Unlike Bioware, Broadsword as a studio is not <i>owned</i> by EA, however EA still serves as SWTOR\'s publisher.

I wish I could credit the original artist (Minicrit?) with a link, but alas, RIP Google Plus. </i><br /></p><p><b>The big PvP debacle on original Ilum</b></p><p>Another thing that made headlines around launch was the planet Ilum and the PvP taking place there. You see, the western ice shelf where the Gree visit nowadays used to be a dedicated PvP area. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JNT33oSXjE" target="_blank">This brief video by Force Gaming</a> should give you an idea of how it was <i>supposed</i> to work. It was released about two weeks after launch, and the video notes that at the time, people were just flipping objectives and not much PvP was going on. This was "fixed" with a patch... that in turn <a href="https://spinksville.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/swtor-the-oops-we-just-broke-high-level-world-pvp-patch/" target="_blank">broke the area in a whole bunch of other ways</a>. The result were crazy AoE fests that the game\'s engine couldn\'t deal with very well, which caused people to gain valour way too fast, even as they were just dying over and over in the mayhem. It was just chaos and caused endless complaints.</p><p>Once again, this is something I didn\'t actually get to experience directly, as I took my time levelling and didn\'t get to Ilum until about three months later, by which time all the craziness had already died down. In January 2013, I actually wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-strangeness-of-ilum-year-later.html">The strangeness of Ilum a year later</a>", but in those first weeks after launch, it was seemingly all people would talk about on forums and news sites, about how this newly launched MMO clearly didn\'t know how to deal with PvP and was therefore already failing horribly.</p><p><b>The original Rakghoul event</b></p><p>The recurring Rakghoul Resurgence event is probably old hat to most of you at this point - just another world event that comes around every so often and which has been around for what feels like forever. The very first Rakghoul event in April 2012 though... that was something else. The activities it came with weren\'t really any more exciting than what we have in the repeating event, but the vibe was very different and unique, mainly because we had no idea it was coming.</p><p>The game was still very new at the time, had a lot going on and we were getting patches and updates about more patches all the time... but this came as a complete surprise, and the experience of everyone being confused about what was going on and slowly figuring things out over the course of the first day was unique and exciting in a way that I think is hard to convey nowadays. You can read <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/world-event.html">the blog post I wrote about it at the time</a> to get an idea though. (I also wrote <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-plague-day-4.html">two</a> <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/04/rakghoul-event-end.html">follow-ups</a>.)</p><p>Ultimately the fact that it was a time-limited one-off was also one of the biggest criticisms Bioware received, which is why they eventually swapped to making new events recurring. The Rakghouls would eventually join the rotation in <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-rakghouls-are-here.html">early 2014</a>.</p><p><b>The Grand Acquisitions Race</b></p><p>The Grand Acquisitions Race (sometimes also referred to as "the Chevin event") was SWTOR\'s second one-time world event, and a lot less exciting than the original Rakghoul incursion on Tatooine. One reason for this was that <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/world-event-take-2.html">we actually knew that it was coming</a>, even if we didn\'t know the details. The second reason however was that it was simply <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-grand-acquisitions-race-in-review.html">a lot less exciting in terms of activities</a>, as all there was to do was a time-gated puzzle quest chain and farming currency crates on Nar Shaddaa. I have to chuckle a bit when I occasionally see people say that this event should be brought back. People didn\'t even care about it that much when the game was still in its heyday and a limited-time world event was something exciting! Still, I guess my point is you had to be there to know just how underwhelming it really was.</p><p><b>The return of Revan</b></p><p>I think this one might be a bit hard to parse for anyone who started playing after 2014. We all&nbsp;know Revan is in the game, right? There\'s a whole expansion called "Shadow of Revan", no? Well, for a moment, try to imagine that there wasn\'t. Revan is in the game, but only in this weird side quest that you\'ll only see if you like doing group content, and he\'s a prisoner one moment and a genocidal maniac the next, and if you blink you\'ll miss him dying as well. Also note that you had to have levelled through and done group content <i>on both factions</i> to be able to make sense of this brief cameo, something which fans of the original KotOR were not at all happy about.</p><p>Then it\'s 2014 - we\'ve been level 55 for a bit over a year, got several new daily areas and raids, everything\'s kind of chugging along nicely if you\'re not dying for your character\'s personal story to be continued... and then we start getting <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/04/assault-on-tython-and-korriban.html">a new series of flashpoints</a> that\'s being promoted as a new story arc called "Forged Alliances". That Theron guy is kinda cute, but aside from that it\'s all a bit mysterious. Who are these new troublemakers in the shadows? The answer came <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/09/legacy-of-rakata.html">in September</a>, in a post in which I felt the need to give a spoiler warning.</p><p>Whoa, Revan is back? Revan is <i>alive</i>? Is it really him though? And then <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2014/10/quick-30-announcement-thoughts.html">a whole expansion with his name</a>! It was exciting times for a while, showing once again that Revan\'s name still attracted the crowds. I think reception of the expansion storyline was ultimately a bit mixed - it gave the character a better send-off than the base game had for sure, but it was still a bit awkward in the eyes of some.</p><p><b>The launch of Knights of the Fallen Empire</b></p><p>Did you realise that we\'re less than a month away from the KotFE expansion turning ten years old? I\'m sure I\'m not the only long-time player who still thinks of everything pre-KotFE as the good old days, and everything that came after it as "the new stuff". It is after all a fact that it changed the game in bigger ways than perhaps anything that came afterwards, with the introduction of features like level sync or its complete overhaul of the companion system.</p><p>Still, I\'m not even talking about all of that. What made KotFE\'s launch a "you had to be there" moment was just <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/06/fallen-empire-stuff.html">how absolutely insane the hype was</a>. A new CGI trailer for the first time since launch! Accidental leaks with announcements that could be interpreted in multiple possible ways! General Star Wars hype as <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-star-wars-hype-is-building-up.html">we were all looking forward to the sequel trilogy</a>! (Oops.) Absolute mayhem!</p><p>And when it came out, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2015/10/knights-of-fallen-empires-story-is.html">people (including me) did indeed love it</a>! Mainstream gaming sites were like "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/knights-of-the-fallen-empire-a-great-solo-star-wars-story/" target="_blank">hey, this game still exists and is good</a>"! It felt like we were all set for a big SWTOR renaissance... except it all fizzled out within a couple of months. People thought the story was neat, but they didn\'t want to hang around to wait for one new chapter per month. They felt there wasn\'t enough to do at endgame. And those of us who <i>did</i> stick around quickly found out how tedious the new story was to play through on alts, never mind the plot going in directions that became more and more aggravating. For the second time in its life, SWTOR had released (something) with a lot of hype and then failed to live up to it.</p><p><b>Galactic Command</b></p><p>For anyone who might not know, Galactic Command was a new gearing/endgame progression system introduced&nbsp;with the Knights of the Eternal Throne expansion, and in its original iteration, it was the worst system of its kind that I\'ve personally ever seen. To add insult to injury, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/10/galactic-command-bioware-trying-to.html">people (including me) were telling them from the moment it was announced that it was a bad idea</a>, but the devs were all "nah, it\'ll work and be fun, you\'ll see".</p><p>It didn\'t and it wasn\'t. For me, the early days of Galactic Command <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2016/12/control-alt-escape.html">were one of my all-time low points with the game</a>. Fortunately the devs scrambled to fix it immediately after launch, but it took about six months to get it into what could be described as an "acceptable" state and many players <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/11/galactic-command-is-alright-now.html">held a grudge long after</a>. It\'s another one of those things that in hindsight makes you wonder what could\'ve been <i>sooo</i> bad about it, but if you were there, you know.</p><p><b>Theron\'s betrayal</b></p><p>I did say there were spoilers in here,&nbsp;didn\'t I?&nbsp;I think looking at the game\'s storylines as a whole, the Fractured Alliances story (consisting of the three flashpoints Crisis on Umbara, Traitor Among the Chiss and The Nathema Conspiracy) is probably not among many people\'s favourites. The writing definitely felt like it had dug itself into a bit of a hole with Knights of the Eternal Throne, and it wasn\'t clear how it was going to get out of it.</p><p>I actually think that Fractured Alliances ultimately succeeded in what it set out to do, but it\'s fair to say that it was a bumpy ride. One thing I really did enjoy about it though was the community interactions it created. Theron\'s betrayal in Crisis on Umbara was not well-received for a <i>variety</i> of reasons, but it was interesting to watch the conversation around it evolve as more people started to believe that the whole thing was just a ruse. In hindsight, there are some hints towards this from the beginning, but they were easy to overlook at first.</p><p>People just didn\'t want their love interest to betray them, and there was even a hashtag called #believeintheron making the rounds on Twitter. I remember seeing screenshots of people assembling on Odessen with all their Therons out and forming a heart-shape or something. I just thought that was very cool, and actually kind of made me more invested in the final outcome than the story itself would have been able to do on its own.</p><p><b>Darth Malgus\' return</b></p><p>Back in 2017, I wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2017/10/11-npcs-that-died-before-their-time.html">11 NPCs That Died Before Their Time</a>" and Darth Malgus was second on my list. I just couldn\'t believe that they put him in all the cinematic trailers and then simply had him get killed off in one of the first endgame flashpoints! I\'m not sure I was aware at the time that there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajDDJDY0Y-k" target="_blank">a supposedly deleted scene from the KotFE trailer</a> that showed Malgus being delivered to Valkorion, frozen in a block of carbonite. Even if I was, it seemed obvious at the time that they\'d deleted it for a reason and for all intents and purposes, Malgus was still considered dead.</p><p>When he really did come back with the Ossus update at the end of 2018, <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2018/12/the-return-of-spoiler.html">I absolutely loved it</a>. It was a really well-presented surprise, and while I don\'t think it was as big as the return of Revan, for me personally it was actually <i>more</i> meaningful than that had been. It\'s hard to think that it\'s already been seven years since then - at this point it feels like it should be obvious to everyone playing the game in any capacity at all that Darth Malgus is alive. However, that moment when we first found out was definitely special. (Cue some comment about how he\'s unfortunately outstayed his welcome since then.)</p><p><b>Move to Broadsword</b></p><p>Two years ago, when <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/06/swtor-to-move-from-bioware-to-broadsword.html">IGN leaked the news that Star Wars: The Old Republic was going to be transferred from Bioware to some largely unknown studio called Broadsword Entertainment</a>, all hell broke loose in the community for a few weeks.&nbsp;I think dedicated SWTOR players are quite used to endless doom-saying about the game and are well-practised at ignoring it by this point, but this sounded serious, and it was not at all clear what the consequences were going to be.</p><p>To me it was probably more worrying than even the original free-to-play announcement had been, and I found myself seeking solace in spending a lot more time than usual talking to fellow content creators. I also felt compelled to try and do my own part by practising something vaguely resembling journalism, which meant assembling information from different sources and trying to put it into context for people. In hindsight it seems almost silly how much we worried, considering how little changed from a player perspective after the studio transition, but at the time it was big news.</p><p><b>Runner-ups:</b></p><p>I could\'ve tried to come up with even more stories, but I thought that 10 was a good number to stop at. Nonetheless, here are three more events that I considered mentioning but decided against because they were mostly negative but also ultimately not <i>that</i> interesting to talk about in detail in my opinion:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The original free-to-play transition</li><li>The Legacy of the Sith expansion launch</li><li>The whole <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/character-modernisation-panic-on-pts.html">character texture update</a> drama</li></ul><p>Which of all of these events were you personally around for? Do you agree with my characterisation of how things went down? Are there any other major events in the game\'s history that you would\'ve included on this list?</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>Star Wars: The Old Republic is primarily know for its developer-crafted stories, but any player who\'s engaged with the social side of the game for any length of time knows that there are also community-driven stories and dramas, and moments when you simply had to be there to know what made them so exciting, even if some of the related content is still available in the game today. As someone who\'s been a subscriber since early access and never stopped playing, I thought it would be fun to share some of the most interesting moments I remember with my readers, especially with newer ones who may not have been playing as long.</p><p>Note: If you\'ve never played through some of the expansion storylines, some of the later items on this list will contain story spoilers.</p><p><b>The /getdown bug</b></p><p>Going chronologically, let\'s start with a story with which I amused my guildies one night. Back when the game launched, you could apparently do dance emotes in combat, and someone quickly discovered that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/o1luk/huge_exploit_typing_getdown_will_interrupt_an/" target="_blank">doing /getdown would suddenly prevent opponents from attacking</a>. This was actually picked up by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/let-the-wookiee-waltz-swtors-god-cheat" target="_blank">several gaming</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dancing-exploit-uncovered-in-the-old-republic" target="_blank">news sites</a> at the time, both because SWTOR was the newest hotness in town and because the mere idea of enemies being stunned into inaction by your dancing skills was a very funny thing to write headlines about.</p><p>I never saw this bug in action myself, but I did come across this comic on social media at the time which made me laugh so much that I saved it:</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcsNcSxsfLhqSOCaVxJ1NWyLqP7L1d0CpzEKRIBtfDaSk-qki1XmEbXD298DqygHNtvzeinCG5LPio-Lfhykc8VHK5o4NA8R5o4FR3PeNiivndjqvOTvp8p7wP_RwslOKqfAELchTtXMzIVcPGmzMqh4rSicws7DVUaamRntcOPi3KRkceF2sv2MZ3H7A/s2795/Getdown%20battle.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A cartoon shows a large battle droid saying &quot;Prepare to be crushed, foolish Jedi&quot; while facing two Jedi knights.

I wish I could credit the original artist (Minicrit?) with a link, but alas, RIP Google Plus. </i><br /></p><p><b>The big PvP debacle on original Ilum</b></p><p>Another thing that made headlines around launch was the planet Ilum and the PvP taking place there. You see, the western ice shelf where the Gree visit nowadays used to be a dedicated PvP area. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JNT33oSXjE" target="_blank">This brief video by Force Gaming</a> should give you an idea of how it was <i>supposed</i> to work. It was released about two weeks after launch, and the video notes that at the time, people were just flipping objectives and not much PvP was going on. This was "fixed" with a patch... that in turn <a href="https://spinksville.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/swtor-the-oops-we-just-broke-high-level-world-pvp-patch/" target="_blank">broke the area in a whole bunch of other ways</a>. The result were crazy AoE fests that the game\'s engine couldn\'t deal with very well, which caused people to gain valour way too fast, even as they were just dying over and over in the mayhem. It was just chaos and caused endless complaints.</p><p>Once again, this is something I didn\'t actually get to experience directly, as I took my time levelling and didn\'t get to Ilum until about three months later, by which time all the craziness had already died down. In January 2013, I actually wrote a post called "<a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-strangeness-of-ilum-year-later.html">The strangeness of Ilum a year later</a>", but in those first weeks after launch, it was seemingly all people would talk about on forums and news sites, about how this newly launched MMO clearly didn\'t know how to deal with PvP and was therefore already failing horribly.</p><p><b>The original Rakghoul event</b></p><p>The recurring Rakghoul Resurgence event is probably old hat to most of you at this point - just another world event that comes around every so often and which has been around for what feels like forever. The very first Rakghoul event in April 2012 though... that was something else. The activities it came with weren\'t really any more exciting than what we have in the repeating event, but the vibe was very different and unique, mainly because we had no idea it was coming.</p><p>The game was still very new at the time, had a lot going on and we were getting patches and updates about more patches all the time... but this came as a complete surprise, and the experience of everyone being confused about what was going on and slowly figuring things out over the course of the first day was unique and exciting in a way that I think is hard to convey nowadays.

The Jedi Prisoner is an interesting storyline, but all the flashpoints involved in it are definitely in the bottom half of my list if I had to rank all flashpoints from best to worst. Gameplay-wise, they\'re all kind of long and boring, and while there are a lot of mobs that can be skipped, that just makes the whole experience feel a bit unsatisfying in a different way (to me anyway). Also, what\'s the point of doing Boarding Party if you don\'t get to confront Captain Yelto at the end?!</p><p>Unsurprisingly, my favourite run of this objective was the one I did with Mr Commando, who - despite not having run any flashpoints in what felt like forever - still remembered his exact pulling routine to unlock the Taral V bonus boss in what he felt was the most efficient way possible, which I thought was quite beautiful to behold. As it happened, we also had to pug one dps in that run, and I was a bit worried that we might get someone who\'d be annoyed at us not skipping everything to finish the run as quickly as possible. However, we got lucky and got a level 15 who actually seemed quite delighted by the experience, gained six levels throughout the flashpoint and asked us at the end whether we wanted to do another one, which I thought was cute.</p><p>Running a master mode flashpoint was also an objective once again, and I was happy to do so on five servers (Shae Vizla is only being left out because I can\'t get the queue to pop there, even while queueing as tank or healer). My random pops this week were Blood Hunt, Cademimu, Mandalorian Raiders and Assault on Tython times two, which took me up to four runs of the latter this season already.</p><p>I\'m curious whether that was just pure RNG or whether this is a side effect of the new exclusion rules. I have this theory that people primarily choose to exclude flashpoints from their random queue for three reasons:</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>They\'re perceived as too hard (e.g. Ruins of Nul, Shrine of Silence).</li><li>They\'re perceived as too long (e.g. The Esseles, Directive 7).</li><li>They\'re perceived as easy and overfarmed to an annoying degree (e.g. Hammer Station, Athiss).</li></ol><p>If all four people that are up next in the queue have excluded five flashpoints for different reasons, that narrows the selection down by quite a lot - and I reckon Assault on Tython may simply be one of those that slips through the net either way, as it\'s neither faceroll easy nor particularly hard, and not terribly long either (especially if you skip some of the early trash). Has anyone else been seeing more of this one than usual? My hypothesis will need further testing for sure.</p><p>As for the other flashpoints, Blood Hunt was largely unremarkable, and Cademimu was the one I did with Mr Commando, which once again meant doing the bonus and just dragging a pug along whether they liked it or not, though they didn\'t complain about it. It was funny though when the guildie who was our fourth accidentally took the elevator downstairs in the middle of the bonus boss fight.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the weirdest/most amusing run was probably the Mandalorian Raiders I did on Satele Shan. I noted <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/gs9-flashpointing-week-3.html">last week</a> that I\'m not a fan of dps running ahead and pulling when I\'m the tank, right? Well, in this one there was a Guardian dps who took off like a bat out of hell the moment we zoned in and then kept pulling non-stop. I considered saying something like "you know this is master mode, right" but decided that this would\'ve been too passive-aggressive - but also, I was honestly kind of confused more than anything because of how he kept <i>getting away</i> with it, in the sense that none of the trash seemed to hurt him too badly even when he got all the aggro. I was even starting to wonder whether I\'d accidentally queued for veteran mode by mistake.</p><p>It wasn\'t until we killed Braxx the Bloodhound with the healer dead and everyone else on about ten percent health that the Guardian paused and said something along the lines of "I only just realised this is master mode since there were no kolto stations". So that was kind of humorous. He did stop pulling after that, we had a few more mishaps anyway, but ultimately it was all good.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p>This week was probably the least fun week of Galactic Season 9 for me so far, though I can\'t tell for sure whether the objectives were just less fun by themselves or whether my "new season enthusiasm" was slowly starting to wear off.

The cherry on top was that this particular encounter has an achievement for clicking the terminal really quickly after getting to that stage of progression - not this week, bucko!</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxNr5_CGl83zXhHIAJ4-_d6qzrSlu39SIrrZR3xzeG-46ckmcM8sRBHn4ieCRNx9aWWv8jYeB3uyjcbKsyf37p7CH93SDUIlpRKbz7_ESfeVSbGXz3H65yWW54EPkfI4JdS2ioKMnsRElUlOXNG_3ja4YOszZ59XkMrnLfI1Kqb5oxdZOqEIa0rkDkFHI/s1920/Crowd%20in%20Kaas%20City%20dynamic%20encounter.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A crowd of people in the Kaas City expansion area, waiting for a dynamic encounter terminal to respawn" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxNr5_CGl83zXhHIAJ4-_d6qzrSlu39SIrrZR3xzeG-46ckmcM8sRBHn4ieCRNx9aWWv8jYeB3uyjcbKsyf37p7CH93SDUIlpRKbz7_ESfeVSbGXz3H65yWW54EPkfI4JdS2ioKMnsRElUlOXNG_3ja4YOszZ59XkMrnLfI1Kqb5oxdZOqEIa0rkDkFHI/w400-h225/Crowd%20in%20Kaas%20City%20dynamic%20encounter.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The veteran flashpoint of the week was the first part of the Jedi Prisoner storyline on each faction, which meant running either Taral V or Boarding Party and was another objective I wasn\'t too thrilled about. The Jedi Prisoner is an interesting storyline, but all the flashpoints involved in it are definitely in the bottom half of my list if I had to rank all flashpoints from best to worst. Gameplay-wise, they\'re all kind of long and boring, and while there are a lot of mobs that can be skipped, that just makes the whole experience feel a bit unsatisfying in a different way (to me anyway). Also, what\'s the point of doing Boarding Party if you don\'t get to confront Captain Yelto at the end?!</p><p>Unsurprisingly, my favourite run of this objective was the one I did with Mr Commando, who - despite not having run any flashpoints in what felt like forever - still remembered his exact pulling routine to unlock the Taral V bonus boss in what he felt was the most efficient way possible, which I thought was quite beautiful to behold. As it happened, we also had to pug one dps in that run, and I was a bit worried that we might get someone who\'d be annoyed at us not skipping everything to finish the run as quickly as possible. However, we got lucky and got a level 15 who actually seemed quite delighted by the experience, gained six levels throughout the flashpoint and asked us at the end whether we wanted to do another one, which I thought was cute.</p><p>Running a master mode flashpoint was also an objective once again, and I was happy to do so on five servers (Shae Vizla is only being left out because I can\'t get the queue to pop there, even while queueing as tank or healer). My random pops this week were Blood Hunt, Cademimu, Mandalorian Raiders and Assault on Tython times two, which took me up to four runs of the latter this season already.</p><p>I\'m curious whether that was just pure RNG or whether this is a side effect of the new exclusion rules. I have this theory that people primarily choose to exclude flashpoints from their random queue for three reasons:</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>They\'re perceived as too hard (e.g. Ruins of Nul, Shrine of Silence).</li><li>They\'re perceived as too long (e.g. The Esseles, Directive 7).</li><li>They\'re perceived as easy and overfarmed to an annoying degree (e.g. Hammer Station, Athiss).</li></ol><p>If all four people that are up next in the queue have excluded five flashpoints for different reasons, that narrows the selection down by quite a lot - and I reckon Assault on Tython may simply be one of those that slips through the net either way, as it\'s neither faceroll easy nor particularly hard, and not terribly long either (especially if you skip some of the early trash). Has anyone else been seeing more of this one than usual? My hypothesis will need further testing for sure.</p><p>As for the other flashpoints, Blood Hunt was largely unremarkable, and Cademimu was the one I did with Mr Commando, which once again meant doing the bonus and just dragging a pug along whether they liked it or not, though they didn\'t complain about it. It was funny though when the guildie who was our fourth accidentally took the elevator downstairs in the middle of the bonus boss fight.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the weirdest/most amusing run was probably the Mandalorian Raiders I did on Satele Shan. I noted <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/gs9-flashpointing-week-3.html">last week</a> that I\'m not a fan of dps running ahead and pulling when I\'m the tank, right? Well, in this one there was a Guardian dps who took off like a bat out of hell the moment we zoned in and then kept pulling non-stop. I considered saying something like "you know this is master mode, right" but decided that this would\'ve been too passive-aggressive - but also, I was honestly kind of confused more than anything because of how he kept <i>getting away</i> with it, in the sense that none of the trash seemed to hurt him too badly even when he got all the aggro. I was even starting to wonder whether I\'d accidentally queued for veteran mode by mistake.</p><p>It wasn\'t until we killed Braxx the Bloodhound with the healer dead and everyone else on about ten percent health that the Guardian paused and said something along the lines of "I only just realised this is master mode since there were no kolto stations". So that was kind of humorous. He did stop pulling after that, we had a few more mishaps anyway, but ultimately it was all good.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/gs9-week-4-thoughts.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/09/gs9-week-4-thoughts.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxNr5_CGl83zXhHIAJ4-_d6qzrSlu39SIrrZR3xzeG-46ckmcM8sRBHn4ieCRNx9aWWv8jYeB3uyjcbKsyf37p7CH93SDUIlpRKbz7_ESfeVSbGXz3H65yWW54EPkfI4JdS2ioKMnsRElUlOXNG_3ja4YOszZ59XkMrnLfI1Kqb5oxdZOqEIa0rkDkFHI/s72-w400-h225-c/Crowd%20in%20Kaas%20City%20dynamic%20encounter.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '2'}

You know it\'s an easy one when you set yourself a goal to reach a certain objective by the end of the week and end up ticking off several others by accident before you even get there! That\'s the kind of week it was.</p><p>The dynamic encounter planet of the week was Ilum. It\'s the planet I\'ve <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/ranking-77-dynamic-encounter-planets.html">ranked as the least fun</a> in terms of dynamic encounters so far, but the reason I did so was that I think many encounters have a high mob density that tends to get in the way of whatever the actual objective is. In a week like this one, where there were plenty of people on Ilum every day, this wasn\'t nearly as bad as mobs were constantly getting cleared out left and right. Turns out even the rather tedious Fall of Fort Tonvarr can be fun with a sufficiently large crowd of people around.</p><p>The featured veteran mode flashpoint of the week was Mandalorian Raiders, which is another relatively easy one. I wonder if all the featured flashpoints will be softballs or whether the devs will make us "graduate" to some of the trickier ones as the season progresses.</p><p>Anyway, nothing too noteworthy happened in any of my runs of this particular flashpoint this week, except that in one run where we had particularly high dps (it was a group with multiple level 80s if I recall correctly) the last boss was burned down so quickly that he completely forgot to do any mechanics, just stood there and didn\'t move until he died. The only downside of this was that this also seemed to bug out his on-screen position, as none of us were able to loot him, always getting the "you can\'t reach that" error message.</p><p>I still remember when at least parts of this flashpoint could be quite deadly, such as if you pushed the last boss himself too quickly and got too many turret adds, but in the one group where this happened it was no problem to survive the turret fire anyway.</p><p>Also, the dog trash used to hit so hard, I remember on master mode we\'d have to rotate stuns to make sure the tank would survive. I will say though that in runs with lower-level characters, I did notice that ahead of some pulls with multiple dogs, people often suddenly step on the brakes, clearly waiting for someone else to go first and get pounced on (I tended to volunteer).</p><p>The more exciting thing were once again the master mode flashpoints though, even if I got a pretty tame selection this week.</p><p>On Leviathan I got Hammer Station at last! I\'m happy that it took until week three for it to show up in my randoms. Also, we actually killed all the trash to the first boss properly instead of trying to run like headless chickens, which is something I appreciated.</p><p>On Tulak Hord I got into a Maelstrom Prison and nearly died on the first pull when I got all the healer aggro just as a guildie was asking me something, but other than that it was smooth. And yes, a guildie was actually online in the largely inactive guild I joined! They asked me to invite an alt of theirs into the guild, so I had them invite two of mine in return after the flashpoint, so I can at last reap a few more Conquest rewards on this server. (Now, if only I knew what to do with my Imps...)</p><p>On Star Forge, I did several flashpoints on Swtorista\'s stream, and we got Nathema Conspiracy and Legacy of the Rakata. In the former, we actually did no skips, and we all agreed that the last boss used to be way harder somehow. In the latter, we wiped once on the bonus boss, oops! But it was all good fun.</p><p>On Satele Shan, I once again used my magic tank powers to get an instant pop for a pug. The power is addictive! This time I got into Red Reaper, a flashpoint I hadn\'t done in ages. A dps Powertech was constantly running ahead, which annoyed me a bit because if you\'re on a class that can tank and you want to always be the first to charge in, just queue as tank, damn it! These sorts of damage dealers are my least favourite to tank for. Though this one did stop just short of actually trying to pull for me. Fortunately I did still end up remembering all the pulls and skips so I managed to keep up reasonably well.

You know it\'s an easy one when you set yourself a goal to reach a certain objective by the end of the week and end up ticking off several others by accident before you even get there! That\'s the kind of week it was.</p><p>The dynamic encounter planet of the week was Ilum. It\'s the planet I\'ve <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/ranking-77-dynamic-encounter-planets.html">ranked as the least fun</a> in terms of dynamic encounters so far, but the reason I did so was that I think many encounters have a high mob density that tends to get in the way of whatever the actual objective is. In a week like this one, where there were plenty of people on Ilum every day, this wasn\'t nearly as bad as mobs were constantly getting cleared out left and right. Turns out even the rather tedious Fall of Fort Tonvarr can be fun with a sufficiently large crowd of people around.</p><p>The featured veteran mode flashpoint of the week was Mandalorian Raiders, which is another relatively easy one. I wonder if all the featured flashpoints will be softballs or whether the devs will make us "graduate" to some of the trickier ones as the season progresses.</p><p>Anyway, nothing too noteworthy happened in any of my runs of this particular flashpoint this week, except that in one run where we had particularly high dps (it was a group with multiple level 80s if I recall correctly) the last boss was burned down so quickly that he completely forgot to do any mechanics, just stood there and didn\'t move until he died. The only downside of this was that this also seemed to bug out his on-screen position, as none of us were able to loot him, always getting the "you can\'t reach that" error message.</p><p>I still remember when at least parts of this flashpoint could be quite deadly, such as if you pushed the last boss himself too quickly and got too many turret adds, but in the one group where this happened it was no problem to survive the turret fire anyway.</p><p>Also, the dog trash used to hit so hard, I remember on master mode we\'d have to rotate stuns to make sure the tank would survive. I will say though that in runs with lower-level characters, I did notice that ahead of some pulls with multiple dogs, people often suddenly step on the brakes, clearly waiting for someone else to go first and get pounced on (I tended to volunteer).</p><p>The more exciting thing were once again the master mode flashpoints though, even if I got a pretty tame selection this week.</p><p>On Leviathan I got Hammer Station at last! I\'m happy that it took until week three for it to show up in my randoms. Also, we actually killed all the trash to the first boss properly instead of trying to run like headless chickens, which is something I appreciated.</p><p>On Tulak Hord I got into a Maelstrom Prison and nearly died on the first pull when I got all the healer aggro just as a guildie was asking me something, but other than that it was smooth. And yes, a guildie was actually online in the largely inactive guild I joined! They asked me to invite an alt of theirs into the guild, so I had them invite two of mine in return after the flashpoint, so I can at last reap a few more Conquest rewards on this server. (Now, if only I knew what to do with my Imps...)</p><p>On Star Forge, I did several flashpoints on Swtorista\'s stream, and we got Nathema Conspiracy and Legacy of the Rakata. In the former, we actually did no skips, and we all agreed that the last boss used to be way harder somehow. In the latter, we wiped once on the bonus boss, oops! But it was all good fun.</p><p>On Satele Shan, I once again used my magic tank powers to get an instant pop for a pug. The power is addictive! This time I got into Red Reaper, a flashpoint I hadn\'t done in ages. A dps Powertech was constantly running ahead, which annoyed me a bit because if you\'re on a class that can tank and you want to always be the first to charge in, just queue as tank, damn it! These sorts of damage dealers are my least favourite to tank for. Though this one did stop just short of actually trying to pull for me. Fortunately I did still end up remembering all the pulls and skips so I managed to keep up reasonably well. I was really just having tank ego problems here: I got an instant pop and had a smooth run where nobody died, but one of the dps was playing in a manner that was slightly annoying to me, woe is me.</p><p>On Darth Malgus, we managed to field two groups for master mode flashpoints after our social ops run on Saturday, which was something I was very happy to see as I\'ve always felt that flashpoints are a great social activity.

Yet the level 80 was constantly mounting up and driving ahead, aggroing absolutely everything to pull it into a corner at the end, while the rest of us slowly jogged after them on foot.

I got the impression that at least one of them got a bit flustered by that and tried to overcompensate by mounting up and rushing ahead even of the level 80 at one point, just to then be told off because not everyone had made it up the elevator yet when we were put into combat as a result of that (which was technically correct but also must\'ve been confusing in terms of mixed messages).</p><p>I got really annoyed with that level 80\'s attitude but didn\'t say anything because frankly I was quite busy just keeping up with their constant running myself, as well as just keeping everyone else alive.

I just kept hoping that neither of the little guys were genuinely new players because if I had been a newbie in that situation, I would have been <i>so</i> put off from running flashpoints ever again.</p><p>Now, to be clear, all of this technically has nothing to do with the cut scene change, because people could act like that while the group conversations were still a thing. However, at least the cut scenes would put the brakes on things a little bit. They were a reminder that this flashpoint wasn\'t <i>designed</i> to be rushed like that. And I feel that the removal of the cut scenes does the opposite now, vindicating people like that level 80 in the sense that yes, the devs agree with you that flashpoints are something to get over and done with as quickly as possible. I feel like my opinion was validated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1mvj1j5/group_finder_flashpoint_skippers_are_insatiable/">a thread on the SWTOR subreddit</a>&nbsp;posted this week about how this kind of behaviour seemed to be worse than ever since the patch. In a comment thread there, someone who commented that "games are meant to be fun" also received the reply: "It\'s a season objective. <b>Literally not meant to be fun.</b> Just a way to progress."</p><p>I just kept thinking to myself: What are we doing here? Why are we optimising content for people who don\'t like it? And I realised that I\'m worried about SWTOR flashpoints going down the way of World of Warcraft dungeons.</p><p>WoW was my first MMO as well as my introduction to doing group content with random players, and I <i>loved</i> it. The first time I did the Deadmines? Amazing. I got yelled at for ninja-looting a chest because I didn\'t know any better, but I apologised, learned from it and we moved on. For about three or four years, dungeons were easily one of my favourite things to do in the game. However, somewhere along the line, things changed. Blizzard wanted players to run dungeons in greater numbers and more often, so they became increasingly incentivised for endless replay, and people\'s attitudes changed accordingly.</p><p>I still play WoW almost twenty years later, but I rarely do dungeons in its modern incarnation now. Every now and then some reward will lure me into queueing up for a pug dungeon again, just for me to instantly be reminded of why I no longer find them fun. Everything is just an insane rush to the end to pick up the reward and it\'s a casual or new player\'s absolute nightmare.</p><p>When I started playing SWTOR, I instantly fell in love with the game\'s flashpoints too. The Esseles and Black Talon are absolutely amazing experiences that have no real equivalent in other games when you play through them in a group for the first time and as intended (which is to say, actually paying attention to the story and listening to the group conversations). They are also clearly not intended to be re-run on a daily basis. Sure, they can be fun to re-play every now and then, to see what different conversation choices do and so on, but it\'s clearly not something you\'re supposed to do <i>all the time</i>. The game won\'t stop you from running it multiple times a day if you want to, but I think it\'s fair to say that you were effectively "doing it wrong" in that case and couldn\'t really complain if it wasn\'t super fun. The idea with SWTOR flashpoints was that they were still meant to be a bit of an adventure every time you entered one, something you can only really consume in moderation.</p><p>With this change... I don\'t really know anymore. I can even defend the removal of cut scenes as a temporary measure for the Galactic Season, mostly because it benefits me personally, but people like me, who do Galactic Seasons on every server, can hardly make up a significant chunk of the player base. Clearly the intent is to get more players into flashpoints that haven\'t done them before, but I\'m not sure this whole exercise is going to show them anything appealing enough to want to come back. Endless running along corridors with no rhyme or reason about what is going on? What\'s appealing about that?</p><p>I also saw someone comment somewhere that Final Fantasy XIV used to have a similar problem with new players having a bad experience in the group finder due to issues with cut scene skipping, and Square Enix\'s solution to that was to make the cut scenes unskippable for <i>everyone</i> and increase the reward payout to make sure veterans were being suitably compensated for the fact that the run was taking longer to accommodate the newbies. Now, I don\'t play FFXIV myself, so I can\'t tell you how well that worked out for everyone, but I think it shows that "whelp, we\'ve got to cater to the people who are in a hurry" is not an inevitability. SWTOR and FF have a lot in common in terms of their focus on story, so it\'s actually kind of odd to me now to see the SWTOR devs choose speed-running over story in this instance.</p><p>At this point, after thinking about it some more, I feel like instead of removing cut scenes all over the place they should\'ve gone back and reconsidered what flashpoints are all about and why people are funnelled into them the way they are. Why do people ask to skip cut scenes? Because they\'re in a flashpoint they don\'t really want to be in. Why are they in this flashpoint? Because we give extra rewards for queueing for a random flashpoint. Why do we give rewards for that? So people who want to run specific flashpoints can get groups for them. But why would people run the Esseles in a group these days when there is a solo mode available anyway? Maybe the devs should\'ve just taken it out of the group finder like they did Kuat and Colicoid War Games. Leaving it in but taking out everything that actually made it unique and insteresting just feels like extremely muddled game design to me.

The image doesn\'t actually show the choice, but I saved it under the name "light side pug" - so the fact that I had ended up in a group of all light side characters on Imperial side stood out to me. I loved it when I found my people! And when someone disagreed about what the "right" choice was in a certain scenario, there was usually some friendly banter to be had. No more.</p><p></p><p>(Just as a disclaimer so nobody gets the wrong idea: I didn\'t "force" any of these pugs to wait for me while I was watching cut scenes. My attitude was always to skip if people wanted to skip, and watch if people wanted to watch, but you could easily get some great shots of certain moments even while space-barring through most of the conversation.)</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p><p>I said in <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/07/some-interesting-news-from-swtors-771.html">my post about the dev live stream last month</a> that the most impactful announcement to me was that patch 7.1.1 was going to remove all cut scenes and group conversations from group finder flashpoints.

The image doesn\'t actually show the choice, but I saved it under the name "light side pug" - so the fact that I had ended up in a group of all light side characters on Imperial side stood out to me. I loved it when I found my people! And when someone disagreed about what the "right" choice was in a certain scenario, there was usually some friendly banter to be had. No more.</p><p></p><p>(Just as a disclaimer so nobody gets the wrong idea: I didn\'t "force" any of these pugs to wait for me while I was watching cut scenes.

It could be very hit and miss whether our tank could kite him long enough without anything going horribly wrong.

The best we could work out eventually was that a Watchman Sentinel\'s group healing could cause the add to mistake them for a healer and leap to them, because the moment our own Sentinel changed to a different spec for this fight, the random leaps into melee stopped happening.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/another-one-for-books-scum-speed-run.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/08/another-one-for-books-scum-speed-run.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3Uo6I8H2wt3B3tn75sZTwtqDUowehc6ljxTdMbLrjZQgwL1cd6FBSIVT641LMgyOdVM2_NT48vXcebI5tgZKUpEwUtMjv74lmibd7bzFHefXCK3_bkRuOprZtlS1thAR6wGlxIh1Eva1c0EwbCLx2aCpBGgA0btyjbTbrCOa3tJbrN0dhwZXnr3QlBew/s72-w400-h225-c/Scum%20speed%20run%20achievement%20shot.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

I had fun with the top ten lists I made for <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/01/the-best-and-worst-dynamic-encounters.html">Hoth</a> and <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/01/the-best-and-worst-dynamic-encounters.html">Tatooine</a>, but that format doesn\'t work so well when you\'re dealing with a larger number of planets, each of which has a much smaller number of dynamic encounters than <i>those</i> two.</p><p>I ultimately decided that I\'m just going to rank the planets against each other instead, talking about each planet in more general terms instead of discussing too many individual encounters in detail.</p><p>Going from best to worst, I would start with:&nbsp;</p><p><b>1. Dromund Kaas</b></p><p>If you split the seven planets that had dynamic encounters added in 7.7 into three groups - capital worlds, starter planets and Ilum - I think both of the capital worlds definitely came out on top. With more than twenty unique encounters per planet they offer the most variety of the bunch, as well as offering an easy way to grind Conquest points.</p><p>The encounters on Dromund Kaas are thematically very varied, mostly leaning into the different regional "themes" previously established in side missions, such as the spaceport being somewhat in disarray or the lightning spires being under attack. They mostly seem to be set in the same time period as those original exploration missions, though I noticed while dispersing unruly Imperial citizens in Kaas City that one of them yelled "What is Xarion hiding?", which I thought was an interesting detail that would place that one after Onslaught in the timeline.</p><p>In general, most of the encounters are quick and fun, and strategically placed in locations where people are bound to come through on their way to some other mission objective, making it very temping to allow yourself to be distracted for a moment to complete an encounter. Prime examples of this are doing "Bad Monkey" just after arriving at the spaceport, or hunting down the rogue bounty hunter while passing through Kaas City.</p><p>If I had to cite anything negative, I\'d say that there are a <i>couple</i> of encounters with flaws. The Apex Predator in "Shock and Awe" feels way overtuned for levelling players (trying to solo it on a level thirty-something with a healer companion I was chunked to death within only a couple of hits), and the final boss for "Kubaz Incursion" can be a bit annoyingly hard to find. "Powder Keg" actually being possible to fail is a neat idea but the fact that it\'s the only encounter of this kind and that it\'s not obvious at all what is going on unless you\'re already in the know makes it a bit unpleasant in that regard.</p><p>Also, I wish they\'d fix encounter voice lines sometimes playing when the encounter isn\'t even up, because every time my speeder rides past the lightning spires I get spammed with yells about multiple encounters that may not actually all be active.</p><p>Anyway, all in all it\'s still a fun romp, and the reason it\'s edging out Coruscant for first place in my opinion is that the map makes it both cheap and easy to get around if you want to do multiple encounters. Which brings us to...</p><p><b>2. Coruscant&nbsp;</b></p><p>In general, Coruscant is one of <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/03/all-swtor-planets-ranked-from-best-to.html">my top three planets in the entire game</a>, and most positive things I said about the dynamic encounters on Dromund Kaas above also apply to Coruscant. The reason I put it in second place is simply the fact that it\'s a bit of a pain to travel between dynamic encounters due to the planetary layout with the different sectors, which all count as being really far apart, which in turn means that moving between them always requires either a looong taxi ride or paying the maximum price for quick travel. Even if you do opt for quick travel though, the sectors are still laid out in such a way that it can be a pain to just travel from one dynamic encounter within the same sector to the next one.</p><p>The said, I adore most of the encounters in the Senate Plaza, which is where I\'m always passing through when I exit my stronghold, and I basically never pass on an opportunity to set off some fireworks or to help clean up the party\'s aftermath.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/s1920/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Fireworks going off at the Senate Plaza on Coruscant" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/w400-h225/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Negatives are that some of the Black Sun and Justicar encounters don\'t have nearly enough clickies if there\'s even more than one person trying to do the encounter at the same time, the way Ugnaught Engineering was horrifically bugged when it first came out and made people get into fights about who was supposedly <i>causing</i> it to bug, stealing kills or whatever (regardless of whether it was true or not), and the one encounter on the Senate Plaza that I don\'t like, "Understaffed". Like with "Powder Keg", you can tell someone just wanted to try something different there, but the final result is just too undercooked, with a tutorial mode that teaches you to do things <i>the wrong way</i>, and people being able to ruin the encounter for each other - both intentionally and unintentionally -&nbsp;which is never a good thing.</p><p><b>3. Tython&nbsp;</b></p><p>Next we have the starter planets, which I think are all pretty similar in quality, and I don\'t feel particularly strongly about the order in which I\'ve ranked them against each other. The main reason I consider them worse than the capital planets it that there are very few encounters, so you\'ll run out of things to do pretty quickly if you\'re just trying to grind on a single planet, and that none of the DEs on the starter planets give Conquest points. I can see why the devs decided to have that limitation, but it still means that for someone who\'s very Conquest-focused like me, they tend to have a lot less replay value.</p><p>With that general preamble out of the way, Tython is definitely my favourite of the bunch, since it\'s my favourite of all the starter planets and I think all its dynamic encounters are very on point, whether you\'re doing simple chores at the Jedi Temple or beating back the flesh raiders.</p><p>The only thing I\'ll say is that I do wonder a little how having a dynamic encounter pop up the moment you leave your intro phase is going to affect new players\' perception of the planet and the game as a whole, and whether it might make things come off as a bit "loud" and overwhelming to less experienced gamers. I would love to have insight into the devs\' behavioural metrics on the starter planets for that one...&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>4. Hutta</b></p><p>Hutta is actually one of my least favourite planets, generally speaking, but I think in terms of dynamic encounters it works well enough. Again, the themes of the encounters go very well with what\'s also conveyed via the existing side missions, from dangerous wildlife to rebellious evocii.</p><p>The only thing I\'m not so sure about is having an encounter that is basically a vehicle quest right outside the spawn phase, because it makes me wonder whether that isn\'t a bit confusing/overwhelming for new players. Even if seeing a bunch of droids enter the gang wars right outside the Poison Pit <i>does</i> serve to drive home the point that the town is a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/s1920/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A walker on Ord Mantell surrounded by dozens of loot beams" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/w400-h225/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>5. Ord Mantell</b><p></p><p>Ord Mantell is one of two planets where I actually feel like some of the encounters are <i>slightly</i> off in tone. This may very well be my personal bias speaking, as someone who mains a trooper and was instantly scarred by being blamed for the death of Bellis the informant at the hands of the separatists by multiple people, but I always perceived the whole setting with the separatists as very dark and desperate. Even the smuggler story with all its goofiness has a pretty dark turn here with Corso\'s parents being dead because of the separatists and him having that one moment where he wants to execute that random sep in cold blood.</p><p>With that said, I just feel like some of the encounters involving separatists feel a bit too silly. Like that mad scientist type sending you out to shoot separatists with one of his droids? It\'s one thing if there\'s a specific NPC that\'s bit ridiculous when you talk to them, that\'s clearly just that one character, but the fact that you hear the dynamic encounter yells repeated endlessly even when you\'re just driving by gives them a much stronger impact on the mood in my opinion. Might just be me.</p><p><b>6. Korriban</b></p><p>That\'s also the reason why I rate Korriban last of this batch, because again, several of the encounters just feel a <i>bit</i> too goofy to me personally. Don\'t get me wrong, both the Sith warrior and inquisitor stories have plenty of humorous moments even on Korriban, but I still always got the vibe that as a <i>setting</i>, the planet is clearly meant to be very grim, with all the racial purity nonsense and dog-eat-dog behaviour encouraged in the acolytes. Stuff like k\'lor\'slugs running wild around the academy feels more like the kind of hijinx you\'d find in a young adult book series about a magic school. (That said, looking at how busy each planet is, this one actually seems to be very popular with people, so again, this might just be me.)</p><p><b>7. Ilum&nbsp;</b></p><p>Finally, in last place - alas, poor Ilum. I really wanted the addition of dynamic encounters to this planet to feel like a revival for it. I have some fond memories of Ilum from the game\'s early days, even though it felt somewhat unfinished even then, but over time it\'s only ever declined in relevance. Sadly I can\'t say that I feel like dynamic encounters have put it back on people\'s radar, and based on the small number of other people I see doing encounters there, I get the impression that it didn\'t really land for the majority of the population either.</p><p>Good things first: the theming is once again spot-on on this one. They really leaned into the Republic vs. Empire conflict from the original storyline and even added some encounter achievements that are meant to encourage world PvP. (I\'m 99% sure that almost nobody will bother with those, but I appreciate the effort.) On the Western Ice Shelf, they\'ve expanded on the lore of the Tonvarr Pirates that were previously only really relevant during the Gree event. It all works.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/s1920/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Sith Pureblood, surrounded by pets and companions, sits on the stone throne inside Fort Tonvarr" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/w400-h225/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The problem is simply that too many of the encounters are just not very fun. Too many of them have multiple stages and feature a large number of mobs - when sometimes mob-killing isn\'t even part of the main objective, which makes it feel like you\'re just endlessly wading back and forth through constantly respawning mobs to actually get to the next clicky you need. It just feels tedious to the point that my brain keeps trying to forget that Ilum is another planet that has dynamic encounters now and I very rarely even remember to go there.</p><p>All that said, I wanted to also give a shout-out to a change to dynamic encounters in general that came with 7.7 but that I didn\'t see in the patch notes: When they released these new encounters, they changed it so that on staged DEs, you no longer need to complete every single stage by yourself to get credit, but rather you can join in at any time and still get completion. I feel that this has been a great change and has been most noticeable for me during encounters such as the base attacks on Tatooine and Hoth. It used to be that I felt that there was no point in joining in if people were already fighting the stage two walker, as it wouldn\'t give me anything and I\'d just have to restart the encounter from scratch afterwards anyway. Now I\'ll gleefully jump in and help out because I\'ll actually be rewarded for it too, which I think has been a great change.</p><p>How many of the new encounters have you done at this point? And do you agree with my ranking of the planets or not?

I had fun with the top ten lists I made for <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/01/the-best-and-worst-dynamic-encounters.html">Hoth</a> and <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/01/the-best-and-worst-dynamic-encounters.html">Tatooine</a>, but that format doesn\'t work so well when you\'re dealing with a larger number of planets, each of which has a much smaller number of dynamic encounters than <i>those</i> two.</p><p>I ultimately decided that I\'m just going to rank the planets against each other instead, talking about each planet in more general terms instead of discussing too many individual encounters in detail.</p><p>Going from best to worst, I would start with:&nbsp;</p><p><b>1. Dromund Kaas</b></p><p>If you split the seven planets that had dynamic encounters added in 7.7 into three groups - capital worlds, starter planets and Ilum - I think both of the capital worlds definitely came out on top. With more than twenty unique encounters per planet they offer the most variety of the bunch, as well as offering an easy way to grind Conquest points.</p><p>The encounters on Dromund Kaas are thematically very varied, mostly leaning into the different regional "themes" previously established in side missions, such as the spaceport being somewhat in disarray or the lightning spires being under attack. They mostly seem to be set in the same time period as those original exploration missions, though I noticed while dispersing unruly Imperial citizens in Kaas City that one of them yelled "What is Xarion hiding?", which I thought was an interesting detail that would place that one after Onslaught in the timeline.</p><p>In general, most of the encounters are quick and fun, and strategically placed in locations where people are bound to come through on their way to some other mission objective, making it very temping to allow yourself to be distracted for a moment to complete an encounter. Prime examples of this are doing "Bad Monkey" just after arriving at the spaceport, or hunting down the rogue bounty hunter while passing through Kaas City.</p><p>If I had to cite anything negative, I\'d say that there are a <i>couple</i> of encounters with flaws. The Apex Predator in "Shock and Awe" feels way overtuned for levelling players (trying to solo it on a level thirty-something with a healer companion I was chunked to death within only a couple of hits), and the final boss for "Kubaz Incursion" can be a bit annoyingly hard to find. "Powder Keg" actually being possible to fail is a neat idea but the fact that it\'s the only encounter of this kind and that it\'s not obvious at all what is going on unless you\'re already in the know makes it a bit unpleasant in that regard.</p><p>Also, I wish they\'d fix encounter voice lines sometimes playing when the encounter isn\'t even up, because every time my speeder rides past the lightning spires I get spammed with yells about multiple encounters that may not actually all be active.</p><p>Anyway, all in all it\'s still a fun romp, and the reason it\'s edging out Coruscant for first place in my opinion is that the map makes it both cheap and easy to get around if you want to do multiple encounters. Which brings us to...</p><p><b>2. Coruscant&nbsp;</b></p><p>In general, Coruscant is one of <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/03/all-swtor-planets-ranked-from-best-to.html">my top three planets in the entire game</a>, and most positive things I said about the dynamic encounters on Dromund Kaas above also apply to Coruscant. The reason I put it in second place is simply the fact that it\'s a bit of a pain to travel between dynamic encounters due to the planetary layout with the different sectors, which all count as being really far apart, which in turn means that moving between them always requires either a looong taxi ride or paying the maximum price for quick travel. Even if you do opt for quick travel though, the sectors are still laid out in such a way that it can be a pain to just travel from one dynamic encounter within the same sector to the next one.</p><p>The said, I adore most of the encounters in the Senate Plaza, which is where I\'m always passing through when I exit my stronghold, and I basically never pass on an opportunity to set off some fireworks or to help clean up the party\'s aftermath.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/s1920/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Fireworks going off at the Senate Plaza on Coruscant" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_a6FQcPP8W5GZckLOm8C-iRb-ZH_-6Y38-6TGmdNZ7_GZG-AF9hgJDssSXq2MdxdTylFL-TeeH2Jq63iE6dKIG-E-SGJzh71-Msishpt8MmKvLAGFJFnTcUcxAe9GbxlGHRcDVoGIxJufmDCziqSJ2tnqCUHBA6KURhL-uy2iKuilZJ_-ffsibrEAX-A/w400-h225/Fireworks%20event%20in%20front%20of%20the%20Senate%20Tower%20on%20Coruscant.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Negatives are that some of the Black Sun and Justicar encounters don\'t have nearly enough clickies if there\'s even more than one person trying to do the encounter at the same time, the way Ugnaught Engineering was horrifically bugged when it first came out and made people get into fights about who was supposedly <i>causing</i> it to bug, stealing kills or whatever (regardless of whether it was true or not), and the one encounter on the Senate Plaza that I don\'t like, "Understaffed". Like with "Powder Keg", you can tell someone just wanted to try something different there, but the final result is just too undercooked, with a tutorial mode that teaches you to do things <i>the wrong way</i>, and people being able to ruin the encounter for each other - both intentionally and unintentionally -&nbsp;which is never a good thing.</p><p><b>3. Tython&nbsp;</b></p><p>Next we have the starter planets, which I think are all pretty similar in quality, and I don\'t feel particularly strongly about the order in which I\'ve ranked them against each other. The main reason I consider them worse than the capital planets it that there are very few encounters, so you\'ll run out of things to do pretty quickly if you\'re just trying to grind on a single planet, and that none of the DEs on the starter planets give Conquest points. I can see why the devs decided to have that limitation, but it still means that for someone who\'s very Conquest-focused like me, they tend to have a lot less replay value.</p><p>With that general preamble out of the way, Tython is definitely my favourite of the bunch, since it\'s my favourite of all the starter planets and I think all its dynamic encounters are very on point, whether you\'re doing simple chores at the Jedi Temple or beating back the flesh raiders.</p><p>The only thing I\'ll say is that I do wonder a little how having a dynamic encounter pop up the moment you leave your intro phase is going to affect new players\' perception of the planet and the game as a whole, and whether it might make things come off as a bit "loud" and overwhelming to less experienced gamers. I would love to have insight into the devs\' behavioural metrics on the starter planets for that one...&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>4. Hutta</b></p><p>Hutta is actually one of my least favourite planets, generally speaking, but I think in terms of dynamic encounters it works well enough. Again, the themes of the encounters go very well with what\'s also conveyed via the existing side missions, from dangerous wildlife to rebellious evocii.</p><p>The only thing I\'m not so sure about is having an encounter that is basically a vehicle quest right outside the spawn phase, because it makes me wonder whether that isn\'t a bit confusing/overwhelming for new players. Even if seeing a bunch of droids enter the gang wars right outside the Poison Pit <i>does</i> serve to drive home the point that the town is a bit of a mess.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/s1920/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A walker on Ord Mantell surrounded by dozens of loot beams" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidlrTLwQmIPhq67l0EJ4jKLdSsQLkvtK1Ind4gwIPZOKKTy05gaGcukwv_ankMyP1g5xwk2eFt6zWAtZha59ha3iy5brewtxB7g2jAiZjT6oJirQnOEdom7myn8iaA7Q3FTmwYo3pRa2LLfMtwce9ZJZEqupvH30qU86ROVovv095w6IQAvRJOHg5sReg/w400-h225/Walker%20mayhem%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>5. Ord Mantell</b><p></p><p>Ord Mantell is one of two planets where I actually feel like some of the encounters are <i>slightly</i> off in tone. This may very well be my personal bias speaking, as someone who mains a trooper and was instantly scarred by being blamed for the death of Bellis the informant at the hands of the separatists by multiple people, but I always perceived the whole setting with the separatists as very dark and desperate. Even the smuggler story with all its goofiness has a pretty dark turn here with Corso\'s parents being dead because of the separatists and him having that one moment where he wants to execute that random sep in cold blood.</p><p>With that said, I just feel like some of the encounters involving separatists feel a bit too silly. Like that mad scientist type sending you out to shoot separatists with one of his droids? It\'s one thing if there\'s a specific NPC that\'s bit ridiculous when you talk to them, that\'s clearly just that one character, but the fact that you hear the dynamic encounter yells repeated endlessly even when you\'re just driving by gives them a much stronger impact on the mood in my opinion. Might just be me.</p><p><b>6. Korriban</b></p><p>That\'s also the reason why I rate Korriban last of this batch, because again, several of the encounters just feel a <i>bit</i> too goofy to me personally. Don\'t get me wrong, both the Sith warrior and inquisitor stories have plenty of humorous moments even on Korriban, but I still always got the vibe that as a <i>setting</i>, the planet is clearly meant to be very grim, with all the racial purity nonsense and dog-eat-dog behaviour encouraged in the acolytes. Stuff like k\'lor\'slugs running wild around the academy feels more like the kind of hijinx you\'d find in a young adult book series about a magic school. (That said, looking at how busy each planet is, this one actually seems to be very popular with people, so again, this might just be me.)</p><p><b>7. Ilum&nbsp;</b></p><p>Finally, in last place - alas, poor Ilum. I really wanted the addition of dynamic encounters to this planet to feel like a revival for it. I have some fond memories of Ilum from the game\'s early days, even though it felt somewhat unfinished even then, but over time it\'s only ever declined in relevance. Sadly I can\'t say that I feel like dynamic encounters have put it back on people\'s radar, and based on the small number of other people I see doing encounters there, I get the impression that it didn\'t really land for the majority of the population either.</p><p>Good things first: the theming is once again spot-on on this one. They really leaned into the Republic vs. Empire conflict from the original storyline and even added some encounter achievements that are meant to encourage world PvP. (I\'m 99% sure that almost nobody will bother with those, but I appreciate the effort.) On the Western Ice Shelf, they\'ve expanded on the lore of the Tonvarr Pirates that were previously only really relevant during the Gree event. It all works.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/s1920/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A female Sith Pureblood, surrounded by pets and companions, sits on the stone throne inside Fort Tonvarr" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd-H8U6YAho5_cUeyM7UBH_D4w3fXab8TWzzRsuCyWNWjpD4gjGe3DOaQf3vMD2wwpaaQEgi80tCPJ7oHQkjw_WxNF_K0uh88po9DFp2ROO_59OIkKMjIGGbhWVEzufMDPbNkDb9Qy50r-s0XuXvaTKRsMVegUDRMmvFe8jZGomkI9Dn04P79ymNdYyhQ/w400-h225/Arrah%20on%20the%20throne%20in%20Fort%20Tonvarr.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The problem is simply that too many of the encounters are just not very fun. Too many of them have multiple stages and feature a large number of mobs - when sometimes mob-killing isn\'t even part of the main objective, which makes it feel like you\'re just endlessly wading back and forth through constantly respawning mobs to actually get to the next clicky you need. It just feels tedious to the point that my brain keeps trying to forget that Ilum is another planet that has dynamic encounters now and I very rarely even remember to go there.</p><p>All that said, I wanted to also give a shout-out to a change to dynamic encounters in general that came with 7.7 but that I didn\'t see in the patch notes: When they released these new encounters, they changed it so that on staged DEs, you no longer need to complete every single stage by yourself to get credit, but rather you can join in at any time and still get completion. I feel that this has been a great change and has been most noticeable for me during encounters such as the base attacks on Tatooine and Hoth. It used to be that I felt that there was no point in joining in if people were already fighting the stage two walker, as it wouldn\'t give me anything and I\'d just have to restart the encounter from scratch afterwards anyway. Now I\'ll gleefully jump in and help out because I\'ll actually be rewarded for it too, which I think has been a great change.</p><p>How many of the new encounters have you done at this point? And do you agree with my ranking of the planets or not?

I <i>did</i> get both of those things, but as I always do, I have some nits to pick as well.</p><p><b>Story is coming... but later and perhaps less than we\'d hoped</b></p><p>At least when talking with some of my friends, there had been a hope expressed that the next story patch would be one big "catch-up patch" giving us a bigger chunk of story than usual, kind of like how Echoes of Oblivion and Spirit of Vengeance (which were originally supposed to be separate pieces of content) were both released at the same time after delays caused by Covid.</p><p>This... is not going to be the case. 7.8, which will come out before Christmas, will have the "Galactic Threads" story that was originally meant to be included in patch 7.6 last Christmas, and then they\'ll speed up a little bit and add "Master\'s Engima", the story originally built for patch 7.7, with 7.8.1, which should then launch at some point early next year and would usually have included only the start of Galactic Season 10 and no story update.</p><p>While I\'m glad to finally have something close to a date, having to wait another four months or so until the next story drop still hurts - by that point the game will have gone nearly 18 months without a story patch, which is unprecedented in this MMO\'s history.</p><p>The other thing that stuck out to me is that if we\'re getting the story that was meant to be in 7.6 in 7.8, what was meant to be in 7.8 before that? No story? Ultimately it feels like aside from the delays, we also <i>lost</i> one of the twice-a-year story installments due to the strike, which sucks.</p><p>Same thing with date nights by the way - they mentioned working on one back in the 7.6.1 stream, but now we won\'t even get one with 7.7.1, with the next expected release (Torian and Kira) coming with 7.8.1 next year.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Galactic Season 9: Flashpoint Resurgence</b></p><p>As for GS9, its theme is flashpoints. Yippee! There will be Czerka buffs involved like there were for uprisings during GS8, which I don\'t really care about, but I\'m good with running flashpoints with or without buffs. Unfortunately it sounded like the objectives will be veteran mode only, which is a bit disappointing to me personally and will not encourage my guildies to group up I reckon, but still, it\'s flashpoints.</p><p>The most interesting bit of the stream to me personally was the devs talking about how they were using the occasion of this seasonal focus on flashpoints to make some changes to the activity finder. A big quality of life improvement they will make is that you\'ll finally be able to queue as multiple roles again, change roles while queueing (so that you can e.g. do dailies in a dps spec while queueing for a flashpoint as healer) and it will take both of your combat styles into account, meaning you could queue as all <i>three</i> roles if you wanted and have the right combat styles for it. Now, to be clear, only the last bit of that is actually new - both the ability to queue for multiple roles and the ability to queue as a different role than you\'re currently playing were in the game before but got patched out at some point, I think because they were buggy or causing issues of some sort. Still, I\'m very glad to see these features make a comeback at last.</p><p>They are also going to improve the loot you get in flashpoints while levelling, though it\'s not entirely clear what that will mean - I\'m guessing more gear that is actually appropriate for your level and combat style, because getting drops that you can\'t even use or not use for another twenty levels was definitely a thing sometimes.</p><p>For the max levels, you\'ll no longer have to queue for all flashpoints to be eligible for additional daily/weekly rewards, but can exclude a few that you may want to avoid. You still won\'t be rewarded for just spamming Hammer Station and nothing else, but you can untick a couple you don\'t like, which I guess is nice.&nbsp;</p><p><b>No more "spacebar plz"</b></p><p>The thing that kind of shocked me was that in connection to all these flashpoint changes, queued veteran and master mode flashpoints will no longer feature any cut scenes or group conversations; everything will just be auto-skipped and if there was some sort of decision to be made (such as whether to kill or spare the captain in the Black Talon) it will just do so automatically. If you want to see the conversations and cut scenes in the future, you\'ll need to do story mode (where available) or manually walk into the higher difficulty with some friends.</p><p>Now, I completely understand why they are doing this and I\'m sure many people will consider this a major quality of life improvement. I made a whole <a href="https://youtu.be/7Wy2EA4fZrQ?si=CP0QdGpEjH5tDKy6&amp;t=144">compilation poking fun at people\'s urge to skip the cut scenes</a> <i>seven years ago</i>. I\'ve seen it all, from the guy who drops group the moment you zone into the Esseles or Black Talon, to endless arguments about who isn\'t hitting their space bar and why. It was a source of friction for sure.</p><p>AND YET. I myself have always loved the group conversations in flashpoints and was generally happy to watch cut scenes if other people wanted to do so too. I enjoy running flashpoints, but I never "spammed" them to the point where getting the Esseles again made me frustrated. (The only flashpoint that I\'ve managed to get utterly sick of is Hammer Station, and that has nothing to do with cut scenes and everything to do with the community.)</p><p>I also felt that the group conversations often inspired fun little interactions, such as when a dark or light side choice got people chatting. My guildies have seen me express (not-entirely-serious) outrage at killing the engineers or leaving Asara behind in the Esseles more than a few times. And some of the cut scenes also just genuinely looked nice! I have a whole collection of screenshots of pugs in Czerka Corporate Labs, from that last cut scene that shows your group walking into the room looking heroic.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s1741/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Four SWTOR characters about to face down the last boss in Czerka Corporate Labs.

Telling me that you can <i>technically</i> build a group manually and walk in to still see the cut scenes is a bit of a cold comfort because let\'s be real, how often do people do that? How often have you run Kuat Drive Yards since it was removed from the group finder? I just feel like this is going to be one of those things that will end up having negative ripple effects that people won\'t fully feel until later down the line. Or maybe I\'m just a relic of ancient times for having actually enjoyed interacting with my pug mates in small ways, even if there was friction sometimes.</p><p><b>Be free, F2P-ers!</b></p><p>A big change for free-to-play players that\'s coming with the next patch is that the devs will be dropping a <i>lot</i> of the old restrictions on that type of account. You will now also get sprint at level 1,&nbsp;have all action bars unlocked,&nbsp;be able to hide your head slot&nbsp; and equip random purples that you get while levelling. Honestly, with some of the things they mentioned I didn\'t even know there were restrictions for that: What, F2P players couldn\'t display legacy titles before? Or equip companion customisations? WTF?</p><p>Even as someone who\'s always been subscribed, I think this is great news. SWTOR has had a reputation for having extremely draconian F2P restrictions for a long time - I remember how the limited action bars were a source of ridicule across the entire MMO community when the game first went free-to-play. I think the devs did the right thing by being cautious when they first changed payment model back in the day (mostly because other MMOs that followed suit later and kept crowing about how much more generous their F2P model was in comparison, such as Rift and Wildstar, did ultimately not end up doing well).</p><p>However, all of that was over a decade ago, times have changed, and there\'s just no reason to be quite so brutal with all those restrictions on what\'s effectively the game\'s free trial mode.

I <i>did</i> get both of those things, but as I always do, I have some nits to pick as well.</p><p><b>Story is coming... but later and perhaps less than we\'d hoped</b></p><p>At least when talking with some of my friends, there had been a hope expressed that the next story patch would be one big "catch-up patch" giving us a bigger chunk of story than usual, kind of like how Echoes of Oblivion and Spirit of Vengeance (which were originally supposed to be separate pieces of content) were both released at the same time after delays caused by Covid.</p><p>This... is not going to be the case. 7.8, which will come out before Christmas, will have the "Galactic Threads" story that was originally meant to be included in patch 7.6 last Christmas, and then they\'ll speed up a little bit and add "Master\'s Engima", the story originally built for patch 7.7, with 7.8.1, which should then launch at some point early next year and would usually have included only the start of Galactic Season 10 and no story update.</p><p>While I\'m glad to finally have something close to a date, having to wait another four months or so until the next story drop still hurts - by that point the game will have gone nearly 18 months without a story patch, which is unprecedented in this MMO\'s history.</p><p>The other thing that stuck out to me is that if we\'re getting the story that was meant to be in 7.6 in 7.8, what was meant to be in 7.8 before that? No story? Ultimately it feels like aside from the delays, we also <i>lost</i> one of the twice-a-year story installments due to the strike, which sucks.</p><p>Same thing with date nights by the way - they mentioned working on one back in the 7.6.1 stream, but now we won\'t even get one with 7.7.1, with the next expected release (Torian and Kira) coming with 7.8.1 next year.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Galactic Season 9: Flashpoint Resurgence</b></p><p>As for GS9, its theme is flashpoints. Yippee! There will be Czerka buffs involved like there were for uprisings during GS8, which I don\'t really care about, but I\'m good with running flashpoints with or without buffs. Unfortunately it sounded like the objectives will be veteran mode only, which is a bit disappointing to me personally and will not encourage my guildies to group up I reckon, but still, it\'s flashpoints.</p><p>The most interesting bit of the stream to me personally was the devs talking about how they were using the occasion of this seasonal focus on flashpoints to make some changes to the activity finder. A big quality of life improvement they will make is that you\'ll finally be able to queue as multiple roles again, change roles while queueing (so that you can e.g. do dailies in a dps spec while queueing for a flashpoint as healer) and it will take both of your combat styles into account, meaning you could queue as all <i>three</i> roles if you wanted and have the right combat styles for it. Now, to be clear, only the last bit of that is actually new - both the ability to queue for multiple roles and the ability to queue as a different role than you\'re currently playing were in the game before but got patched out at some point, I think because they were buggy or causing issues of some sort. Still, I\'m very glad to see these features make a comeback at last.</p><p>They are also going to improve the loot you get in flashpoints while levelling, though it\'s not entirely clear what that will mean - I\'m guessing more gear that is actually appropriate for your level and combat style, because getting drops that you can\'t even use or not use for another twenty levels was definitely a thing sometimes.</p><p>For the max levels, you\'ll no longer have to queue for all flashpoints to be eligible for additional daily/weekly rewards, but can exclude a few that you may want to avoid. You still won\'t be rewarded for just spamming Hammer Station and nothing else, but you can untick a couple you don\'t like, which I guess is nice.&nbsp;</p><p><b>No more "spacebar plz"</b></p><p>The thing that kind of shocked me was that in connection to all these flashpoint changes, queued veteran and master mode flashpoints will no longer feature any cut scenes or group conversations; everything will just be auto-skipped and if there was some sort of decision to be made (such as whether to kill or spare the captain in the Black Talon) it will just do so automatically. If you want to see the conversations and cut scenes in the future, you\'ll need to do story mode (where available) or manually walk into the higher difficulty with some friends.</p><p>Now, I completely understand why they are doing this and I\'m sure many people will consider this a major quality of life improvement. I made a whole <a href="https://youtu.be/7Wy2EA4fZrQ?si=CP0QdGpEjH5tDKy6&amp;t=144">compilation poking fun at people\'s urge to skip the cut scenes</a> <i>seven years ago</i>. I\'ve seen it all, from the guy who drops group the moment you zone into the Esseles or Black Talon, to endless arguments about who isn\'t hitting their space bar and why. It was a source of friction for sure.</p><p>AND YET. I myself have always loved the group conversations in flashpoints and was generally happy to watch cut scenes if other people wanted to do so too. I enjoy running flashpoints, but I never "spammed" them to the point where getting the Esseles again made me frustrated. (The only flashpoint that I\'ve managed to get utterly sick of is Hammer Station, and that has nothing to do with cut scenes and everything to do with the community.)</p><p>I also felt that the group conversations often inspired fun little interactions, such as when a dark or light side choice got people chatting. My guildies have seen me express (not-entirely-serious) outrage at killing the engineers or leaving Asara behind in the Esseles more than a few times. And some of the cut scenes also just genuinely looked nice! I have a whole collection of screenshots of pugs in Czerka Corporate Labs, from that last cut scene that shows your group walking into the room looking heroic.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF0DXkQY2Xas0l9G7PBaqfyLzNUGgyKI5ZEdMcq7e9pc3K830gAC0YEdyY3crni6GAMwnUQhJ60JeG_ipKOS6XcyG7wAdTmobE6r2ltmY1uOfqsZx589PX4J_uGhVI7qUT9Cn3V3X4f-KYLAdVRQR51fJhIlYWGoYJzGCm8klqkpa5JtCpZCBPJDvB5qk/s1741/Hekka%20pugging%20Czerka%20Corporate%20Labs.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Four SWTOR characters about to face down the last boss in Czerka Corporate Labs.

Telling me that you can <i>technically</i> build a group manually and walk in to still see the cut scenes is a bit of a cold comfort because let\'s be real, how often do people do that? How often have you run Kuat Drive Yards since it was removed from the group finder? I just feel like this is going to be one of those things that will end up having negative ripple effects that people won\'t fully feel until later down the line. Or maybe I\'m just a relic of ancient times for having actually enjoyed interacting with my pug mates in small ways, even if there was friction sometimes.</p><p><b>Be free, F2P-ers!</b></p><p>A big change for free-to-play players that\'s coming with the next patch is that the devs will be dropping a <i>lot</i> of the old restrictions on that type of account. You will now also get sprint at level 1,&nbsp;have all action bars unlocked,&nbsp;be able to hide your head slot&nbsp; and equip random purples that you get while levelling. Honestly, with some of the things they mentioned I didn\'t even know there were restrictions for that: What, F2P players couldn\'t display legacy titles before? Or equip companion customisations? WTF?</p><p>Even as someone who\'s always been subscribed, I think this is great news. SWTOR has had a reputation for having extremely draconian F2P restrictions for a long time - I remember how the limited action bars were a source of ridicule across the entire MMO community when the game first went free-to-play. I think the devs did the right thing by being cautious when they first changed payment model back in the day (mostly because other MMOs that followed suit later and kept crowing about how much more generous their F2P model was in comparison, such as Rift and Wildstar, did ultimately not end up doing well).</p><p>However, all of that was over a decade ago, times have changed, and there\'s just no reason to be quite so brutal with all those restrictions on what\'s effectively the game\'s free trial mode. Annoying players with arbitrary feature locks before they\'ve even left the starter planet was just never great, and I hope that these changes will give more people a chance to actually fall in love with what the game has to offer and then spend some money on it happily instead of feeling nagged from the get-go.</p><p><b>What about subscribers though?</b></p><p>So as not to leave subscribers feeling unappreciated, the game will run a new "subscriber login event" from September to December where you\'ll earn a special currency if you log in at least four times a week, which you can then use to buy some goodies.

The standout among these is probably <a href="https://newoutriders.org/">New Outriders</a>, a multi-gaming guild/community that has its SWTOR branch on Star Forge and in which <a href="https://www.generic-hero.com/ThisWeekinAurabesh/">Intisar</a> is an officer.</p><p>I don\'t get to actually interact with the people there that often because of time zones, but when I do it\'s always cordial, and on the rare occasion when they have an event in the afternoon in their time zone, meaning that I can join in as well, I\'m always excited.</p><p>Yesterday was one such occasion, and it started off in a way that was very flattering to me, as Intisar instructed me to come online a bit early, declaring that a few people would help me get the last three DvL boss kills I was still missing on Star Forge. So we did that, and it wasn\'t actually too painful, even on Hoth! The GS8 achievement for the boss kills by itself doesn\'t actually give anything worthwhile, but it turns out the original achievement to kill all the bosses from back in Knights of the Eternal Throne is also still active, so that triggered as well and I got lots of banner decos for it, which was nice.</p><p>This was also a good example of one of the things I do love about joining events on Star Forge - there I\'m just another member and can rely on other people to carry me a bit. I don\'t mind being an officer in Twin Suns Squadron, but it <i>is</i> also work sometimes, and only the day before I\'d been making lists and parking summon alts all over the place to help my guildies there tick off <i>their</i> last few achievements, so it was a nice change of pace to have someone do the same for me, you know?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVw8dP8fXBz4yQQtIZhFVvPhXYTxUU4Z-OCgTsJOOAdQDs9hM5cuFu4IhHZX0oWXubJYshpIFlV1Y8UEy2ypD_jPIZ0MHPLpG517u5gR1Bb-poUe7zB1bb2hHE1oJReUTUvz4aFaAs00LW4FPlS3uFF7Tj1zn70r9tnXAxCXxHOqjL92Sx3PizfLJIbfA/s1920/New%20Outriders%20dancing%20on%20Quesh.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Members of New Outriders dancing near the Quesh world boss, with fireworks going off" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVw8dP8fXBz4yQQtIZhFVvPhXYTxUU4Z-OCgTsJOOAdQDs9hM5cuFu4IhHZX0oWXubJYshpIFlV1Y8UEy2ypD_jPIZ0MHPLpG517u5gR1Bb-poUe7zB1bb2hHE1oJReUTUvz4aFaAs00LW4FPlS3uFF7Tj1zn70r9tnXAxCXxHOqjL92Sx3PizfLJIbfA/w400-h225/New%20Outriders%20dancing%20on%20Quesh.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Anyway, once the event got started properly, a lot more people came online, including a couple of the officers from the wider community that clearly hadn\'t played SWTOR in a while. I got quite wide-eyed inspecting them, with one of their characters being level 55 and the other one 75. It was like looking at a time capsule! I think I must have gasped lines like "OMG, he\'s got an Oriconian ear piece" out loud at my screen at one point.<p></p><p>The event itself was a very casual-friendly affair open to all levels that involved travelling across various planets, killing world bosses, collecting datacrons and just generally having a bit of fun. I was pretty impressed by how even though there was never a dull moment, I couldn\'t quite tell how much of it had been planned and how much was spontaneous. The characters that had been parked next to difficult-to-reach datacrons had obviously been prepared with intent, but other times we\'d arrive on the scene of a dynamic encounter and Intisar would just go "oh, this one is fun" and we\'d all do it together and I figure that can\'t possibly have been planned that way? I don\'t know.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghVbDsxD1wlhPRmUtPP6_DQqMLCxuGAjpXIzDQtOKkhzcpin3TeYvxbsy46egAteBtYY0KqGl_fTcmIz_yXIIqgYe3rcQ0a_A9Xuwc4VMmknA_eDqCwXnCGWWHtS94Ee4bWDOM728-KWPkdz3oadia0gF8r6ySdoCwrGBe_PBDoqVXOPZ-XXRwrXbTq14/s1920/New%20Outriders%20in%20walkers%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A bunch of walkers stand around in a circle during the Ord Mantell dynamic encounter &quot;Power Walking&quot;" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghVbDsxD1wlhPRmUtPP6_DQqMLCxuGAjpXIzDQtOKkhzcpin3TeYvxbsy46egAteBtYY0KqGl_fTcmIz_yXIIqgYe3rcQ0a_A9Xuwc4VMmknA_eDqCwXnCGWWHtS94Ee4bWDOM728-KWPkdz3oadia0gF8r6ySdoCwrGBe_PBDoqVXOPZ-XXRwrXbTq14/w400-h225/New%20Outriders%20in%20walkers%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The most whimsical detour was when we got to Tython and Intisar beckoned everyone to join him at the planet\'s 0,0 coordinate to marvel at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/q9wc5e/anyone_know_what_is_this/">the strange floating orb of light there</a>. It\'s funny how something that\'s clearly just a random bug has developed into a kind of mysterious attraction and people like to make up their own lore about how the Uxibeast next to the flame must be Force-sensitive or something.</p><p>Since there were no level requirements for the event, I took part using my little Sage alt who had only just earned her own ship (that part was required to be able to accept summons) and she gained no fewer than five levels from gallivanting around the galaxy and trying to take part in killing world bosses. Plus she got a lot of random creature codexes from when people around her decided to kill all the wildlife in the vicinity.</p><p>It was just very wholesome and I\'m always kind of impressed by the joyful energy everyone in the guild still displays while playing the game, even when they\'re off to kill the Coruscant world boss for what must be the 100th time. It probably helps that they have a seemingly endless supply of in-jokes that sometimes make my head spin, including every boss and their abilities having special made-up names.

The standout among these is probably <a href="https://newoutriders.org/">New Outriders</a>, a multi-gaming guild/community that has its SWTOR branch on Star Forge and in which <a href="https://www.generic-hero.com/ThisWeekinAurabesh/">Intisar</a> is an officer.</p><p>I don\'t get to actually interact with the people there that often because of time zones, but when I do it\'s always cordial, and on the rare occasion when they have an event in the afternoon in their time zone, meaning that I can join in as well, I\'m always excited.</p><p>Yesterday was one such occasion, and it started off in a way that was very flattering to me, as Intisar instructed me to come online a bit early, declaring that a few people would help me get the last three DvL boss kills I was still missing on Star Forge. So we did that, and it wasn\'t actually too painful, even on Hoth! The GS8 achievement for the boss kills by itself doesn\'t actually give anything worthwhile, but it turns out the original achievement to kill all the bosses from back in Knights of the Eternal Throne is also still active, so that triggered as well and I got lots of banner decos for it, which was nice.</p><p>This was also a good example of one of the things I do love about joining events on Star Forge - there I\'m just another member and can rely on other people to carry me a bit. I don\'t mind being an officer in Twin Suns Squadron, but it <i>is</i> also work sometimes, and only the day before I\'d been making lists and parking summon alts all over the place to help my guildies there tick off <i>their</i> last few achievements, so it was a nice change of pace to have someone do the same for me, you know?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVw8dP8fXBz4yQQtIZhFVvPhXYTxUU4Z-OCgTsJOOAdQDs9hM5cuFu4IhHZX0oWXubJYshpIFlV1Y8UEy2ypD_jPIZ0MHPLpG517u5gR1Bb-poUe7zB1bb2hHE1oJReUTUvz4aFaAs00LW4FPlS3uFF7Tj1zn70r9tnXAxCXxHOqjL92Sx3PizfLJIbfA/s1920/New%20Outriders%20dancing%20on%20Quesh.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Members of New Outriders dancing near the Quesh world boss, with fireworks going off" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVw8dP8fXBz4yQQtIZhFVvPhXYTxUU4Z-OCgTsJOOAdQDs9hM5cuFu4IhHZX0oWXubJYshpIFlV1Y8UEy2ypD_jPIZ0MHPLpG517u5gR1Bb-poUe7zB1bb2hHE1oJReUTUvz4aFaAs00LW4FPlS3uFF7Tj1zn70r9tnXAxCXxHOqjL92Sx3PizfLJIbfA/w400-h225/New%20Outriders%20dancing%20on%20Quesh.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Anyway, once the event got started properly, a lot more people came online, including a couple of the officers from the wider community that clearly hadn\'t played SWTOR in a while. I got quite wide-eyed inspecting them, with one of their characters being level 55 and the other one 75. It was like looking at a time capsule! I think I must have gasped lines like "OMG, he\'s got an Oriconian ear piece" out loud at my screen at one point.<p></p><p>The event itself was a very casual-friendly affair open to all levels that involved travelling across various planets, killing world bosses, collecting datacrons and just generally having a bit of fun. I was pretty impressed by how even though there was never a dull moment, I couldn\'t quite tell how much of it had been planned and how much was spontaneous. The characters that had been parked next to difficult-to-reach datacrons had obviously been prepared with intent, but other times we\'d arrive on the scene of a dynamic encounter and Intisar would just go "oh, this one is fun" and we\'d all do it together and I figure that can\'t possibly have been planned that way? I don\'t know.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghVbDsxD1wlhPRmUtPP6_DQqMLCxuGAjpXIzDQtOKkhzcpin3TeYvxbsy46egAteBtYY0KqGl_fTcmIz_yXIIqgYe3rcQ0a_A9Xuwc4VMmknA_eDqCwXnCGWWHtS94Ee4bWDOM728-KWPkdz3oadia0gF8r6ySdoCwrGBe_PBDoqVXOPZ-XXRwrXbTq14/s1920/New%20Outriders%20in%20walkers%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A bunch of walkers stand around in a circle during the Ord Mantell dynamic encounter &quot;Power Walking&quot;" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghVbDsxD1wlhPRmUtPP6_DQqMLCxuGAjpXIzDQtOKkhzcpin3TeYvxbsy46egAteBtYY0KqGl_fTcmIz_yXIIqgYe3rcQ0a_A9Xuwc4VMmknA_eDqCwXnCGWWHtS94Ee4bWDOM728-KWPkdz3oadia0gF8r6ySdoCwrGBe_PBDoqVXOPZ-XXRwrXbTq14/w400-h225/New%20Outriders%20in%20walkers%20on%20Ord%20Mantell.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The most whimsical detour was when we got to Tython and Intisar beckoned everyone to join him at the planet\'s 0,0 coordinate to marvel at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/q9wc5e/anyone_know_what_is_this/">the strange floating orb of light there</a>. It\'s funny how something that\'s clearly just a random bug has developed into a kind of mysterious attraction and people like to make up their own lore about how the Uxibeast next to the flame must be Force-sensitive or something.</p><p>Since there were no level requirements for the event, I took part using my little Sage alt who had only just earned her own ship (that part was required to be able to accept summons) and she gained no fewer than five levels from gallivanting around the galaxy and trying to take part in killing world bosses. Plus she got a lot of random creature codexes from when people around her decided to kill all the wildlife in the vicinity.</p><p>It was just very wholesome and I\'m always kind of impressed by the joyful energy everyone in the guild still displays while playing the game, even when they\'re off to kill the Coruscant world boss for what must be the 100th time. It probably helps that they have a seemingly endless supply of in-jokes that sometimes make my head spin, including every boss and their abilities having special made-up names.

I\'m not going to rehash once again what that is or why it\'s important to me - if you need a refresher, I recommend reading one or both of these posts:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>April 2024: <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/04/at-token-war-with-czech-empire.html">At (Token) War with the Czech Empire</a></li><li>December 2024: <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/12/living-degen-conquest-life.html">Living the Degen Conquest Life</a></li></ul><p>The two Conquest events recounted in the above posts taught my guild two important lessons: The first one was that Personal Conquest Requisitions have been a game-changer for small to medium guilds that are willing to plan for the long term, and the second one was that there were even more ways to game that system than simply saving them up over time. I didn\'t mention it in those posts at the time, but one guildie who ended up popping a particularly large number of tokens to help us achieve victory admitted that she had used a character transfer to shuttle in extra Requisitions from another server, where she\'d been collecting them from her login rewards on the side.</p><p>Now, for additional context, my guild successfully conquered every single available planet at some point over the last decade - with one notable exception: Belsavis. For some reason that one <i>always</i> seemed to be taken by a top five guild that we couldn\'t possibly beat, even during Total Galactic War. I\'m not sure why that is, but I can only guess that Belsavis might not come up as often in the rotation as other planets. A planet like Tatooine for example is tied to the Death Mark Conquest event, which in turn is tied to Bounty Contract Week and comes around once a month. Belsavis on the other hand is only available during Emergency Operations and The Dread War (outside of Total Galactic War), two events that don\'t seem to get slotted into the rotation very often.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiynfkO8DKwSt-WV0hG4eCNCQHK67LN3Ciwtoh_E47mPQ0n_VffdqsaVZl_Vz8lh2fdaky2xqnWCnUA274GdLMzvzara6euEjX0vMSXG2poRELBn718-BblOF9zy1fTUKadZu0EaIxcDhIrueM9ZWualWypASkgD0GKjP8-2ZObDy0dB9Q4zPLZ_J-e3EY/s1920/Shintar%20on%20Belsavis%20with%20Galaxy%20Conqueror%20legacy%20title.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Shintar the trooper on her Kath Hound mount on Belsavis, proudly displaying her Dread Master title and Galaxy Conqueror legacy title" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiynfkO8DKwSt-WV0hG4eCNCQHK67LN3Ciwtoh_E47mPQ0n_VffdqsaVZl_Vz8lh2fdaky2xqnWCnUA274GdLMzvzara6euEjX0vMSXG2poRELBn718-BblOF9zy1fTUKadZu0EaIxcDhIrueM9ZWualWypASkgD0GKjP8-2ZObDy0dB9Q4zPLZ_J-e3EY/w400-h225/Shintar%20on%20Belsavis%20with%20Galaxy%20Conqueror%20legacy%20title.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Combining what we learned about Personal Conquest Requisitions and our growing frustration with being unable to lay claim to the <i>one</i> planet people still needed for the Galaxy Conqueror achievement, the biggest Conquest fan in the guild eventually proposed the following: that one of these weeks, we should just pool <i>all</i> our resources from <i>all</i> the servers (he and I both do Galactic Seasons on all servers) and simply go for Belsavis anyway.</p><p>I did some maths around this suggestion initially, and while I kind of liked the boldness of it, it still seemed a little too crazy. We had a lot of Requisitions saved up, but not <i>that</i> many.</p><p>Anyway, last week\'s Total Galactic War arrived and the matter was brought up again. Looking at the scoreboard, all the biggest guilds had committed early for a change, and the guild in the lead on Belsavis was none other than our frenemies the Czech Empire. They were not a top five guild, and <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/04/at-token-war-with-czech-empire.html">we\'d beaten them before</a>... but it had also been the fight of a lifetime, and they were the reason we were so acutely aware of the power of Personal Conquest Requisitions in the first place, so there was no chance that we\'d be able to surprise them.</p><p>I quickly had a look at possible alternative invasion targets (that we had conquered in the past but that newer members would\'ve liked us to conquer again) but nothing stood out as an easy or obvious option, so after a bit of deliberation I decided to commit us to Belsavis. We agreed that we\'d hold off on using any tokens for now and that we\'d play it by ear, deciding our next steps later in the week depending on how it went.</p><p>Interestingly, it went quite differently than a year ago. Back then, we\'d overtaken the Czechs quickly, and they\'d been quite happy to trail us for the rest of the week with a steady ten million point gap between us. This time, they\'d clearly made a push on launch day to get a solid lead from the beginning, and they did not want us to catch them. We were about three million behind by the end of the first day and I figured that this was a difference we should be able to make up quickly enough, but <i>somehow</i> we couldn\'t quite get there. In fact, by Thursday morning the Czechs had grown their lead to seven million, and by evening we were <i>sixteen</i> million points behind them.</p><p>There was a time when being that far behind would\'ve been reason enough for us to fold, but I knew that the game wasn\'t quite over yet this time, as the other Conquest guy and I - <i>if</i> we went ahead with the server transfers - would have over 50 million points in tokens at our disposal. We did discuss amongst ourselves that if they kept gaining points at the same rate we\'d likely have to give up, but for the time being, we kept going.</p><p>Even though I knew that we had a plan, it was honestly a bit demotivating to keep grinding away when we were so far behind. I heard more than one defeatist comment from guildies but still did my best to counter the psychological warfare. I basically told everyone that we\'d let them know once the battle was lost, but as of now it wasn\'t over yet and they just had to trust me and keep going. (People knew about the saved up Conquest Requisitions, but I didn\'t tell anyone outside the leadership circle about the exact numbers since we\'re not very strict about removing people from our Discord for inactivity, and I was paranoid about information getting leaked to the competition somehow.)</p><p>And it seemed to work! While people weren\'t necessarily in the best of spirits, they kept at it. At its worst, the Czech\'s lead grew to around 18 million points, but they only maintained that for a brief while and most of the time the gap between us seemed to hover between ten and sixteen million.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/s1920/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot of a party fighting the last boss in the Landing Party uprising" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/w400-h225/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Then the weekend came and with it a sudden and unexpected burst of energy. (I think I\'m actually starting to notice a trend here, that my guild is better at Conquest in the second half of the week than in the first half.)</p><p>An officer that had been on hiatus for months popped his head in the door, asked how Total Galactic War was going and quickly ground out a half-million points in one evening. Another guild member who hasn\'t really been playing SWTOR in a while piped up to say that he had the week off and fancied randomly lending us a hand with grinding points. The funniest moment to me personally was when another guy who hadn\'t logged in in months showed up on Monday evening and we had a conversation that went something like this (paraphrased):</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Me: Look at you, logging in for the first time since the last Total Galactic War! [I could tell because on log-in he triggered the "Conqueror of Oricon" achievement.]</li><li>Him: Hah, you got me there. Would you like me to pop some tokens?</li><li>Me: How do you even have any? You haven\'t been online and you said you popped them all last time.</li><li>Him: Oops, I guess I lied.</li></ul><p>All of Sunday afternoon and evening the guild was absolutely buzzing with activity and achievements were popping left and right as people went out of their comfort zone and tried content they hadn\'t done before in order to earn Conquest points. Guild PvP was more active than it had been in months and there was plenty of banter. Point gains aside, it was a joy to see.</p><p>We could see that the Czechs were active in the evening and trying to bolster their score with some planetary rampaging, but we actually had a similar number of people online and were absolutely on fire. By the end of the evening, the gap between us was down to less than ten million.</p><p>I expected Monday to be more quiet, so I was both pleasantly surprised and had a good laugh when I decided to do a quick check-in on Monday morning and saw seven people online in guild. Clearly our members were less constrained by work than I\'d expected.</p><p>We continued Sunday\'s trend at a slightly slower pace and the gap between us and first place continued to shrink all day. By the time the last person went to bed we were only about a million points behind.</p><p>Tuesday I was working from home and I had put a bit of time aside around the end of Conquest to pop my Personal Conquest Requisitions as needed.

I\'m not going to rehash once again what that is or why it\'s important to me - if you need a refresher, I recommend reading one or both of these posts:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>April 2024: <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/04/at-token-war-with-czech-empire.html">At (Token) War with the Czech Empire</a></li><li>December 2024: <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/12/living-degen-conquest-life.html">Living the Degen Conquest Life</a></li></ul><p>The two Conquest events recounted in the above posts taught my guild two important lessons: The first one was that Personal Conquest Requisitions have been a game-changer for small to medium guilds that are willing to plan for the long term, and the second one was that there were even more ways to game that system than simply saving them up over time. I didn\'t mention it in those posts at the time, but one guildie who ended up popping a particularly large number of tokens to help us achieve victory admitted that she had used a character transfer to shuttle in extra Requisitions from another server, where she\'d been collecting them from her login rewards on the side.</p><p>Now, for additional context, my guild successfully conquered every single available planet at some point over the last decade - with one notable exception: Belsavis. For some reason that one <i>always</i> seemed to be taken by a top five guild that we couldn\'t possibly beat, even during Total Galactic War. I\'m not sure why that is, but I can only guess that Belsavis might not come up as often in the rotation as other planets. A planet like Tatooine for example is tied to the Death Mark Conquest event, which in turn is tied to Bounty Contract Week and comes around once a month. Belsavis on the other hand is only available during Emergency Operations and The Dread War (outside of Total Galactic War), two events that don\'t seem to get slotted into the rotation very often.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiynfkO8DKwSt-WV0hG4eCNCQHK67LN3Ciwtoh_E47mPQ0n_VffdqsaVZl_Vz8lh2fdaky2xqnWCnUA274GdLMzvzara6euEjX0vMSXG2poRELBn718-BblOF9zy1fTUKadZu0EaIxcDhIrueM9ZWualWypASkgD0GKjP8-2ZObDy0dB9Q4zPLZ_J-e3EY/s1920/Shintar%20on%20Belsavis%20with%20Galaxy%20Conqueror%20legacy%20title.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Shintar the trooper on her Kath Hound mount on Belsavis, proudly displaying her Dread Master title and Galaxy Conqueror legacy title" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiynfkO8DKwSt-WV0hG4eCNCQHK67LN3Ciwtoh_E47mPQ0n_VffdqsaVZl_Vz8lh2fdaky2xqnWCnUA274GdLMzvzara6euEjX0vMSXG2poRELBn718-BblOF9zy1fTUKadZu0EaIxcDhIrueM9ZWualWypASkgD0GKjP8-2ZObDy0dB9Q4zPLZ_J-e3EY/w400-h225/Shintar%20on%20Belsavis%20with%20Galaxy%20Conqueror%20legacy%20title.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Combining what we learned about Personal Conquest Requisitions and our growing frustration with being unable to lay claim to the <i>one</i> planet people still needed for the Galaxy Conqueror achievement, the biggest Conquest fan in the guild eventually proposed the following: that one of these weeks, we should just pool <i>all</i> our resources from <i>all</i> the servers (he and I both do Galactic Seasons on all servers) and simply go for Belsavis anyway.</p><p>I did some maths around this suggestion initially, and while I kind of liked the boldness of it, it still seemed a little too crazy. We had a lot of Requisitions saved up, but not <i>that</i> many.</p><p>Anyway, last week\'s Total Galactic War arrived and the matter was brought up again. Looking at the scoreboard, all the biggest guilds had committed early for a change, and the guild in the lead on Belsavis was none other than our frenemies the Czech Empire. They were not a top five guild, and <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/04/at-token-war-with-czech-empire.html">we\'d beaten them before</a>... but it had also been the fight of a lifetime, and they were the reason we were so acutely aware of the power of Personal Conquest Requisitions in the first place, so there was no chance that we\'d be able to surprise them.</p><p>I quickly had a look at possible alternative invasion targets (that we had conquered in the past but that newer members would\'ve liked us to conquer again) but nothing stood out as an easy or obvious option, so after a bit of deliberation I decided to commit us to Belsavis. We agreed that we\'d hold off on using any tokens for now and that we\'d play it by ear, deciding our next steps later in the week depending on how it went.</p><p>Interestingly, it went quite differently than a year ago. Back then, we\'d overtaken the Czechs quickly, and they\'d been quite happy to trail us for the rest of the week with a steady ten million point gap between us. This time, they\'d clearly made a push on launch day to get a solid lead from the beginning, and they did not want us to catch them. We were about three million behind by the end of the first day and I figured that this was a difference we should be able to make up quickly enough, but <i>somehow</i> we couldn\'t quite get there. In fact, by Thursday morning the Czechs had grown their lead to seven million, and by evening we were <i>sixteen</i> million points behind them.</p><p>There was a time when being that far behind would\'ve been reason enough for us to fold, but I knew that the game wasn\'t quite over yet this time, as the other Conquest guy and I - <i>if</i> we went ahead with the server transfers - would have over 50 million points in tokens at our disposal. We did discuss amongst ourselves that if they kept gaining points at the same rate we\'d likely have to give up, but for the time being, we kept going.</p><p>Even though I knew that we had a plan, it was honestly a bit demotivating to keep grinding away when we were so far behind. I heard more than one defeatist comment from guildies but still did my best to counter the psychological warfare. I basically told everyone that we\'d let them know once the battle was lost, but as of now it wasn\'t over yet and they just had to trust me and keep going. (People knew about the saved up Conquest Requisitions, but I didn\'t tell anyone outside the leadership circle about the exact numbers since we\'re not very strict about removing people from our Discord for inactivity, and I was paranoid about information getting leaked to the competition somehow.)</p><p>And it seemed to work! While people weren\'t necessarily in the best of spirits, they kept at it. At its worst, the Czech\'s lead grew to around 18 million points, but they only maintained that for a brief while and most of the time the gap between us seemed to hover between ten and sixteen million.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/s1920/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A shot of a party fighting the last boss in the Landing Party uprising" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKmH8Yu9n1Eepi0W-X19kf6lPALj3tMb7AqoGvt2iAVEBATUKfcPxCs_i01aO0MYUUDCmvbXx2IprMUaATZtbzKljLgiCoZG04bBvGpY7k771Cuh0veWnQwulKLnzz3O-QH7pWtibFxNpekhCS3xDoozVLa3-PJ0gTedNIdQh3euZTD3yscmh5YrlnAI/w400-h225/Doing%20the%20last%20boss%20of%20Landing%20Party%20uprising.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Then the weekend came and with it a sudden and unexpected burst of energy. (I think I\'m actually starting to notice a trend here, that my guild is better at Conquest in the second half of the week than in the first half.)</p><p>An officer that had been on hiatus for months popped his head in the door, asked how Total Galactic War was going and quickly ground out a half-million points in one evening. Another guild member who hasn\'t really been playing SWTOR in a while piped up to say that he had the week off and fancied randomly lending us a hand with grinding points. The funniest moment to me personally was when another guy who hadn\'t logged in in months showed up on Monday evening and we had a conversation that went something like this (paraphrased):</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Me: Look at you, logging in for the first time since the last Total Galactic War! [I could tell because on log-in he triggered the "Conqueror of Oricon" achievement.]</li><li>Him: Hah, you got me there. Would you like me to pop some tokens?</li><li>Me: How do you even have any? You haven\'t been online and you said you popped them all last time.</li><li>Him: Oops, I guess I lied.</li></ul><p>All of Sunday afternoon and evening the guild was absolutely buzzing with activity and achievements were popping left and right as people went out of their comfort zone and tried content they hadn\'t done before in order to earn Conquest points. Guild PvP was more active than it had been in months and there was plenty of banter. Point gains aside, it was a joy to see.</p><p>We could see that the Czechs were active in the evening and trying to bolster their score with some planetary rampaging, but we actually had a similar number of people online and were absolutely on fire. By the end of the evening, the gap between us was down to less than ten million.</p><p>I expected Monday to be more quiet, so I was both pleasantly surprised and had a good laugh when I decided to do a quick check-in on Monday morning and saw seven people online in guild. Clearly our members were less constrained by work than I\'d expected.</p><p>We continued Sunday\'s trend at a slightly slower pace and the gap between us and first place continued to shrink all day. By the time the last person went to bed we were only about a million points behind.</p><p>Tuesday I was working from home and I had put a bit of time aside around the end of Conquest to pop my Personal Conquest Requisitions as needed. I had transferred four characters to Darth Malgus the day before (my first character transfers ever) and now held 182 tokens in my inventory and cargo hold. Several other people were online and trying to earn some last-minute points while buzzing with excitement.

All that said, it ultimately turned out... alright, I guess.</p><p>I would still put it near the bottom of <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/05/ranking-first-7-galactic-seasons.html">my ranking of all Galactic Seasons so far</a>, for having a theme I didn\'t really care for, not having any rewards that particularly excited me (there was quite a lot of stuff that was "nice", but I\'ve said before that I consider it a downside when there isn\'t a big central reward that also supports the theme), and for feeling more repetitive than any season before it (I still can\'t quite believe they made me kill all the DvL bosses again for a third achievement).&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time though, things were not as bad as I had feared. Once they made the fixes to make doing your weekly uprising via the group finder more viable, the system worked well enough to funnel people into that to guarantee regular pops even on the smaller servers. (I could even get it done on Shae Vizla, where I hadn\'t done anything through the group finder in a long time.) With <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/04/pugging-trench-runner.html">Trench Runner being the one notable exception</a>, the tuning was such that even a group of low-level or generally underperforming characters could muddle through without too much effort.</p><p>I saw more than one comment, whether explicit or implied, that indicated that the person making it was actually doing uprisings for the first time, which is something that\'s always nice to see. And while my overall opinion of uprisings hasn\'t changed (still not a fan), I\'ll admit that I liked them more as levelling content than as max-level content, if that makes sense. The XP was pretty good every time I went in there on a levelling character, and somehow mowing down hordes of weak mobs feels more "on-brand" on a low-level character. It\'s what you do on the starter planets after all, when you\'re just learning how to play and might not necessarily have that many abilities yet. As endgame content I\'ve always found that kind of gameplay a bit unsatisfying though.</p><p>The other thing I did like about this season was how the devs incorporated the dynamic encounters on Hoth and Tatooine into the weekly seasons objectives. I think they\'re a fun new kind of gameplay and I appreciated their addition to this. Especially on the other servers, where I hadn\'t had any reason to do dynamic encounters before, so I enjoyed gathering a bunch of achievements all over again.</p><p>There are a few things I hope they tweak in coming seasons though: First off, there were two variants of each dynamic encounter objective as far as I could tell, one that required you to do 15 for the weekly, and one that required 25. I thought the first was reasonable, while the second was too much. I still did both types this time around because I also had the draw of wanting to work on the achievements to keep me motivated, but when that\'s no longer applicable I don\'t think I would bother with doing 25 again; it\'s just too time-consuming.</p><p>The second "issue" I had was that just having encounters on Hoth and Tatooine made things a bit repetitive. One of my favourite weekly seasons objectives up until now has been the one to do "repeatable or exploration missions" on a number of planets, and I think the dynamic encounter objectives largely replaced those this season.

All that said, it ultimately turned out... alright, I guess.</p><p>I would still put it near the bottom of <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/05/ranking-first-7-galactic-seasons.html">my ranking of all Galactic Seasons so far</a>, for having a theme I didn\'t really care for, not having any rewards that particularly excited me (there was quite a lot of stuff that was "nice", but I\'ve said before that I consider it a downside when there isn\'t a big central reward that also supports the theme), and for feeling more repetitive than any season before it (I still can\'t quite believe they made me kill all the DvL bosses again for a third achievement).&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time though, things were not as bad as I had feared. Once they made the fixes to make doing your weekly uprising via the group finder more viable, the system worked well enough to funnel people into that to guarantee regular pops even on the smaller servers. (I could even get it done on Shae Vizla, where I hadn\'t done anything through the group finder in a long time.) With <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/04/pugging-trench-runner.html">Trench Runner being the one notable exception</a>, the tuning was such that even a group of low-level or generally underperforming characters could muddle through without too much effort.</p><p>I saw more than one comment, whether explicit or implied, that indicated that the person making it was actually doing uprisings for the first time, which is something that\'s always nice to see. And while my overall opinion of uprisings hasn\'t changed (still not a fan), I\'ll admit that I liked them more as levelling content than as max-level content, if that makes sense. The XP was pretty good every time I went in there on a levelling character, and somehow mowing down hordes of weak mobs feels more "on-brand" on a low-level character. It\'s what you do on the starter planets after all, when you\'re just learning how to play and might not necessarily have that many abilities yet. As endgame content I\'ve always found that kind of gameplay a bit unsatisfying though.</p><p>The other thing I did like about this season was how the devs incorporated the dynamic encounters on Hoth and Tatooine into the weekly seasons objectives. I think they\'re a fun new kind of gameplay and I appreciated their addition to this. Especially on the other servers, where I hadn\'t had any reason to do dynamic encounters before, so I enjoyed gathering a bunch of achievements all over again.</p><p>There are a few things I hope they tweak in coming seasons though: First off, there were two variants of each dynamic encounter objective as far as I could tell, one that required you to do 15 for the weekly, and one that required 25. I thought the first was reasonable, while the second was too much. I still did both types this time around because I also had the draw of wanting to work on the achievements to keep me motivated, but when that\'s no longer applicable I don\'t think I would bother with doing 25 again; it\'s just too time-consuming.</p><p>The second "issue" I had was that just having encounters on Hoth and Tatooine made things a bit repetitive. One of my favourite weekly seasons objectives up until now has been the one to do "repeatable or exploration missions" on a number of planets, and I think the dynamic encounter objectives largely replaced those this season. (I did a count, and in the same number of weeks, Season 7 had 17 objectives of this type, while Season 8 had only 7.) This makes sense in so far as they fill a similar niche and the DEs were the new hotness, but it also meant that what previously made this objective so much fun to do - that it was so varied in its locations and could be done in a number of different ways - was kind of lost as we were just stuck on either Tatooine or Hoth week after week.</p><p>We\'ll see how they\'ll handle this in future seasons, but I think my personal preference would be if they simply merged the two types of objectives together, into something like "Complete Dynamic Encounters, Repeatable, Exploration, or Bonus Missions while defeating enemies on Coruscant or Dromund Kaas", therefore restoring the "rotating between different planets" aspect while also including dynamic encounters in the mix.</p><p>Still, I\'ve got to admit I\'m going to try and temper my expectations for whenever they announce Galactic Season 9, because I\'m definitely a bit bored of the repetition and lack of even small bits of newness at this point.

I took some lowbies to the starter planets to check them out as I would\'ve felt a bit weird razing all those level 5 mobs on a max-level character in raid gear, though other people clearly had no such reservations. The new events brought a lot of existing players back to the starter worlds to check out the the new content and earn some new achievements, and the experience felt like absolute mayhem.

It\'s not that I was against companion rewards in principle, but I did feel that the way they were implemented was becoming a bit stale at this point, so focusing on something else for a change was fine by me.</p><p>I <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2023/10/galactic-season-5-story-review.html">loved the little storyline that came with the season</a>, even if it was entirely KOTOR style with no voice acting - I enjoyed its mix of intrigue and humour, and the choices were meaningful enough that it was fun to replay it on multiple characters to see different outcomes. I also appreciated that for the reputation tied to the season, they added a major quality of life feature by making it so that reputation tokens could be acquired by any of your alts on the fleet instead of needing to unlock the seasonal companion on each character first.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxhF5iKziFw92O8xYRH_atWRHxXDeaI-TCQMnGAeEbjNMVAPASvi29uBiDDRMxw6POUrGY39AH5lPpaq7ShDuXm57FN0l5kcENAW7K7NHXF-u06wVly0RpZsZNFNY8PJF20GFRNWevgias2Xted47cqRV4-5nOH9lP7MXaNq6UHC8GxVaFDmnsGseBm5E/s1057/Shintar%20with%20Loth%20kittens.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A smiling Shintar kneels between two Loth-cat kittens on the fleet" border="0" height="216" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxhF5iKziFw92O8xYRH_atWRHxXDeaI-TCQMnGAeEbjNMVAPASvi29uBiDDRMxw6POUrGY39AH5lPpaq7ShDuXm57FN0l5kcENAW7K7NHXF-u06wVly0RpZsZNFNY8PJF20GFRNWevgias2Xted47cqRV4-5nOH9lP7MXaNq6UHC8GxVaFDmnsGseBm5E/w400-h216/Shintar%20with%20Loth%20kittens.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The reward track didn\'t have a major season-defining prize (as cute and iconic as the Loth-cat kitten turned out to be) but was otherwise very solid. I was pleased by the many stronghold decorations, and while I wouldn\'t want to wear any of the armour sets in full, they contained some very nice and versatile pieces that I\'ve gone on to use on several characters since then. My main on Shae Vizla also still rides around on her Armasaur. Overall this season just fully delivered for me in terms of fun, and that\'s all I can really ask for.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 3</b></p><p>Seasons 2-4 were very similar in their format and I feel that they were very close in terms of quality as well. The reason I rate GS3 the highest of the three is that it felt slightly more refined than Season 2, but didn\'t suffer from too much staleness creeping in yet (which was something I felt started happening with Season 4).</p><p>I really liked PH4-LNX as a companion - I thought her dialogues were fun and she had an interesting backstory, which was significantly fleshed out compared to what had been done in Season 2. I also liked the seasonal activity of catching cheating gamblers in cantinas.</p><p>The bright yellow weapons and dyes that were part of the reward track during "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20221020">Luck of the Draw</a>" were a bit garish and didn\'t necessarily match with a lot of things, but yellow is my favourite colour so I still appreciated them. The Security Officer and Pit Boss outfits that you could earn were fantastic looks for non-Force-using characters, and my bounty hunter on the Leviathan server still sports a dyed version of the Pit Boss outfit to this day.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 2</b></p><p>"<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20220215">Shadows of the Underworld</a>" ran from February to July 2022 and made a major splash. It released at the same time as 7.0/Legacy of the Sith, and for those of you who weren\'t around at the time, the expansion was <i>not</i> well received at all. Yet even the loudest complainers could find no flaw with the new Galactic Season, which was a particularly powerful compliment at the time.</p><p>At the end of Season 1 I\'d written up <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2021/07/my-feedback-after-galactic-season-1.html">a list of things that I felt would probably need adjusting going forward</a>, but the devs went above and beyond anything I could\'ve ever thought of and gave the system a major revamp with Season 2, in a rare case of Bioware iterating on something quickly and decisively in a way that was pretty much universally well-received. The changes felt refreshing and smooth and everybody loved them. I remember Swtorista discovering that Fenn Zeil had more than one conversation and being all "OMG, the drama, I\'m so here for it", which made me laugh. Really, the only reason it\'s not closer to the top of the list is that I didn\'t particularly care for the underworld theme or Fenn Zeil as a companion, and I don\'t remember any of the other rewards knocking my socks off either.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 4</b></p><p>&nbsp;"<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20230328">A Passage of Peace</a>" lasted from March to August 2023 and continued to emulate everything that had been good about GS2 and 3. Amity is another companion that I quite liked, though the backstory to justify him being armoured from head to toe and yet another follower who just spouts alien gibberish was particularly convoluted. The armour sets from this season were also very good-looking.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbnP5C8q4mkCWMUF1S6JohrXnAq0ysikkDm1e4PsaJqV3so2mc_U4owIy16GySQ5shT0os2cVEbIAUbYS3WtXQXUhmCChXeNxcLM-xreeLoEs1ZQZksblVmPlp1_qbZkiJeN6sGn708XP3obbusgmWKd2gqOnxTVRkR9UV-Zgd5Q8WLkwB_swKKakOZhk/s1920/Amity%20advising%20Zilek%20about%20Lord%20Umbral.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Amity talking to a male Jedi: &quot;I have never felt such turmoil in naother.

I can see my ranking of this one being somewhat controversial, because I think depending on what you care about in the game, you might have had a very different experience with it.</p><p>The Copero stronghold is gorgeous and made for a fantastic reward, plus I thought the stronghold theme in general worked really well (I really enjoyed visiting multiple different public strongholds for the seasons objective every week). And if that\'s the primary thing you took away from the season, I can easily see this one ranking in someone\'s top three, if not in the top spot.</p><p>However for me, the completely linear storyline that ended abruptly and didn\'t seem to go anywhere felt like a major disappointment after the high bar set by Season 5, and the meta achievement to collect vendor trash was initially confusing, then grindy and frustrating. Maybe those things didn\'t really bother you, and that\'s totally fair. But for me it was ultimately a season both of great highs and disappointing lows, with the latter pushing it further down in my personal ranking. <br /></p><p><b>Galactic Season 7 </b><br /></p><p>I was really hesitant about which season deserved last place and went back and forth on the decision a couple of times. I might honestly feel a bit differently about it depending on the day of the week. As it stands, "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/%5Bnews-category%5D/20240820">The Greatest Bounty</a>" was <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/galactic-season-7-in-review.html">decidedly meh</a> in my opinion, but in an inoffensive way. The white Loth-cat kitten was cute, and I think it\'s good that the DvL bosses were brought back to the game, but ultimately the whole bounty hunting theme felt very weak to me and I thought the whole thing was a bit boring.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 1</b></p><p>The other week I saw someone on the forums get all nostalgic for Season 1, to which my immediate reaction was "no way". I can\'t really think too badly of "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20210426-1">The Strange from Kubindi</a>" since it was SWTOR\'s first season ever, the devs were still figuring out how things should work, and we as players didn\'t have any set expectations yet. However, I also can\'t deny that Season 2 was a massive improvement on it in pretty much every conceivable way.</p><p>Season 1\'s heavy focus on daily objectives was quite draining, and I spent way more time running dailies, heroics, or just grinding mobs than I\'d ever consider fun. I appreciated that Altuur had a bit of an intro conversation on Odessen, but otherwise I didn\'t really care about him, and I didn\'t like the season\'s insect theme either.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK954GK2Q7ZNtsNYNc4rIiqLUSP0kT-4eI_R4HMKmabFZW0crKfpO00geW6xoLZL0u6JQD0jtAbUzF1wEGYTMj9BV0h4nlTnJYrlwRSktCrsMdfNHRMZE8MSb-1-8tNJFBK0qVmrjgR76em_QZK_H0zKCG-VCBRwWMl7drEzs3Ybr7jvU5vh-ZTMiIftg/s1920/Altuur%20on%20Balmorra.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Altuur zok Adon on Balmorra" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK954GK2Q7ZNtsNYNc4rIiqLUSP0kT-4eI_R4HMKmabFZW0crKfpO00geW6xoLZL0u6JQD0jtAbUzF1wEGYTMj9BV0h4nlTnJYrlwRSktCrsMdfNHRMZE8MSb-1-8tNJFBK0qVmrjgR76em_QZK_H0zKCG-VCBRwWMl7drEzs3Ybr7jvU5vh-ZTMiIftg/w400-h225/Altuur%20on%20Balmorra.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Like I said, I never felt too bad about it all since it was all new and I didn\'t know what to expect - plus we got the fleet strongholds during this first season, something I\'d almost forgotten about. Nonetheless, I think that every season that\'s come after has been an improvement on the concept.<p></p><p>Even though seasons have "only" been part of SWTOR for four years, it\'s hard to imagine the game without them now, especially considering how many other MMOs include similar systems nowadays.

I also appreciated that for the reputation tied to the season, they added a major quality of life feature by making it so that reputation tokens could be acquired by any of your alts on the fleet instead of needing to unlock the seasonal companion on each character first.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxhF5iKziFw92O8xYRH_atWRHxXDeaI-TCQMnGAeEbjNMVAPASvi29uBiDDRMxw6POUrGY39AH5lPpaq7ShDuXm57FN0l5kcENAW7K7NHXF-u06wVly0RpZsZNFNY8PJF20GFRNWevgias2Xted47cqRV4-5nOH9lP7MXaNq6UHC8GxVaFDmnsGseBm5E/s1057/Shintar%20with%20Loth%20kittens.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="A smiling Shintar kneels between two Loth-cat kittens on the fleet" border="0" height="216" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxhF5iKziFw92O8xYRH_atWRHxXDeaI-TCQMnGAeEbjNMVAPASvi29uBiDDRMxw6POUrGY39AH5lPpaq7ShDuXm57FN0l5kcENAW7K7NHXF-u06wVly0RpZsZNFNY8PJF20GFRNWevgias2Xted47cqRV4-5nOH9lP7MXaNq6UHC8GxVaFDmnsGseBm5E/w400-h216/Shintar%20with%20Loth%20kittens.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>The reward track didn\'t have a major season-defining prize (as cute and iconic as the Loth-cat kitten turned out to be) but was otherwise very solid. I was pleased by the many stronghold decorations, and while I wouldn\'t want to wear any of the armour sets in full, they contained some very nice and versatile pieces that I\'ve gone on to use on several characters since then. My main on Shae Vizla also still rides around on her Armasaur. Overall this season just fully delivered for me in terms of fun, and that\'s all I can really ask for.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 3</b></p><p>Seasons 2-4 were very similar in their format and I feel that they were very close in terms of quality as well. The reason I rate GS3 the highest of the three is that it felt slightly more refined than Season 2, but didn\'t suffer from too much staleness creeping in yet (which was something I felt started happening with Season 4).</p><p>I really liked PH4-LNX as a companion - I thought her dialogues were fun and she had an interesting backstory, which was significantly fleshed out compared to what had been done in Season 2. I also liked the seasonal activity of catching cheating gamblers in cantinas.</p><p>The bright yellow weapons and dyes that were part of the reward track during "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20221020">Luck of the Draw</a>" were a bit garish and didn\'t necessarily match with a lot of things, but yellow is my favourite colour so I still appreciated them. The Security Officer and Pit Boss outfits that you could earn were fantastic looks for non-Force-using characters, and my bounty hunter on the Leviathan server still sports a dyed version of the Pit Boss outfit to this day.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 2</b></p><p>"<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20220215">Shadows of the Underworld</a>" ran from February to July 2022 and made a major splash. It released at the same time as 7.0/Legacy of the Sith, and for those of you who weren\'t around at the time, the expansion was <i>not</i> well received at all. Yet even the loudest complainers could find no flaw with the new Galactic Season, which was a particularly powerful compliment at the time.</p><p>At the end of Season 1 I\'d written up <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2021/07/my-feedback-after-galactic-season-1.html">a list of things that I felt would probably need adjusting going forward</a>, but the devs went above and beyond anything I could\'ve ever thought of and gave the system a major revamp with Season 2, in a rare case of Bioware iterating on something quickly and decisively in a way that was pretty much universally well-received. The changes felt refreshing and smooth and everybody loved them. I remember Swtorista discovering that Fenn Zeil had more than one conversation and being all "OMG, the drama, I\'m so here for it", which made me laugh. Really, the only reason it\'s not closer to the top of the list is that I didn\'t particularly care for the underworld theme or Fenn Zeil as a companion, and I don\'t remember any of the other rewards knocking my socks off either.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 4</b></p><p>&nbsp;"<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20230328">A Passage of Peace</a>" lasted from March to August 2023 and continued to emulate everything that had been good about GS2 and 3. Amity is another companion that I quite liked, though the backstory to justify him being armoured from head to toe and yet another follower who just spouts alien gibberish was particularly convoluted. The armour sets from this season were also very good-looking.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbnP5C8q4mkCWMUF1S6JohrXnAq0ysikkDm1e4PsaJqV3so2mc_U4owIy16GySQ5shT0os2cVEbIAUbYS3WtXQXUhmCChXeNxcLM-xreeLoEs1ZQZksblVmPlp1_qbZkiJeN6sGn708XP3obbusgmWKd2gqOnxTVRkR9UV-Zgd5Q8WLkwB_swKKakOZhk/s1920/Amity%20advising%20Zilek%20about%20Lord%20Umbral.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Amity talking to a male Jedi: &quot;I have never felt such turmoil in naother.

I can see my ranking of this one being somewhat controversial, because I think depending on what you care about in the game, you might have had a very different experience with it.</p><p>The Copero stronghold is gorgeous and made for a fantastic reward, plus I thought the stronghold theme in general worked really well (I really enjoyed visiting multiple different public strongholds for the seasons objective every week). And if that\'s the primary thing you took away from the season, I can easily see this one ranking in someone\'s top three, if not in the top spot.</p><p>However for me, the completely linear storyline that ended abruptly and didn\'t seem to go anywhere felt like a major disappointment after the high bar set by Season 5, and the meta achievement to collect vendor trash was initially confusing, then grindy and frustrating. Maybe those things didn\'t really bother you, and that\'s totally fair. But for me it was ultimately a season both of great highs and disappointing lows, with the latter pushing it further down in my personal ranking. <br /></p><p><b>Galactic Season 7 </b><br /></p><p>I was really hesitant about which season deserved last place and went back and forth on the decision a couple of times. I might honestly feel a bit differently about it depending on the day of the week. As it stands, "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/%5Bnews-category%5D/20240820">The Greatest Bounty</a>" was <a href="https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2024/11/galactic-season-7-in-review.html">decidedly meh</a> in my opinion, but in an inoffensive way. The white Loth-cat kitten was cute, and I think it\'s good that the DvL bosses were brought back to the game, but ultimately the whole bounty hunting theme felt very weak to me and I thought the whole thing was a bit boring.</p><p><b>Galactic Season 1</b></p><p>The other week I saw someone on the forums get all nostalgic for Season 1, to which my immediate reaction was "no way". I can\'t really think too badly of "<a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20210426-1">The Strange from Kubindi</a>" since it was SWTOR\'s first season ever, the devs were still figuring out how things should work, and we as players didn\'t have any set expectations yet. However, I also can\'t deny that Season 2 was a massive improvement on it in pretty much every conceivable way.</p><p>Season 1\'s heavy focus on daily objectives was quite draining, and I spent way more time running dailies, heroics, or just grinding mobs than I\'d ever consider fun. I appreciated that Altuur had a bit of an intro conversation on Odessen, but otherwise I didn\'t really care about him, and I didn\'t like the season\'s insect theme either.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK954GK2Q7ZNtsNYNc4rIiqLUSP0kT-4eI_R4HMKmabFZW0crKfpO00geW6xoLZL0u6JQD0jtAbUzF1wEGYTMj9BV0h4nlTnJYrlwRSktCrsMdfNHRMZE8MSb-1-8tNJFBK0qVmrjgR76em_QZK_H0zKCG-VCBRwWMl7drEzs3Ybr7jvU5vh-ZTMiIftg/s1920/Altuur%20on%20Balmorra.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Altuur zok Adon on Balmorra" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK954GK2Q7ZNtsNYNc4rIiqLUSP0kT-4eI_R4HMKmabFZW0crKfpO00geW6xoLZL0u6JQD0jtAbUzF1wEGYTMj9BV0h4nlTnJYrlwRSktCrsMdfNHRMZE8MSb-1-8tNJFBK0qVmrjgR76em_QZK_H0zKCG-VCBRwWMl7drEzs3Ybr7jvU5vh-ZTMiIftg/w400-h225/Altuur%20on%20Balmorra.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Like I said, I never felt too bad about it all since it was all new and I didn\'t know what to expect - plus we got the fleet strongholds during this first season, something I\'d almost forgotten about. Nonetheless, I think that every season that\'s come after has been an improvement on the concept.<p></p><p>Even though seasons have "only" been part of SWTOR for four years, it\'s hard to imagine the game without them now, especially considering how many other MMOs include similar systems nowadays. I can only hope that the devs can continue to come up with ways of mixing things up and keeping them interesting to do.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/05/ranking-first-7-galactic-seasons.html'}], 'link': 'https://swtorcommando.blogspot.com/2025/05/ranking-first-7-galactic-seasons.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Shintar)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Shintar', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxhF5iKziFw92O8xYRH_atWRHxXDeaI-TCQMnGAeEbjNMVAPASvi29uBiDDRMxw6POUrGY39AH5lPpaq7ShDuXm57FN0l5kcENAW7K7NHXF-u06wVly0RpZsZNFNY8PJF20GFRNWevgias2Xted47cqRV4-5nOH9lP7MXaNq6UHC8GxVaFDmnsGseBm5E/s72-w400-h216-c/Shintar%20with%20Loth%20kittens.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '2'}

People tend to think of Second Life as this weird little corner of the internet where sex crimes happen, thanks to its poor reputation in media: a space often misunderstood and reduced to headlines. In reality, it\'s home to designers, singers, choreographers, photographers, business owners, and a strong mix of diverse roleplay experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/39847fe2-9b7f-4421-ab87-bf8ed4e0b04f/Off+to+Italy+Shi.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">One of those roleplay communities is focused on Greek Life found on HBCU campuses. I am a proud member and one of the founders of one such organization, Alpha Omega Mu. Founded in 2007, AΩM has been a passion of mine off and on throughout the years. AΩM has deep roots in honoring the Divine Nine, a collection of African American sororities and fraternities that started in the United States in the 1800s, and our focus on charity is a core part of who we are. For 18 years, we have raised funds for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and have also contributed to other organizations’ charity drives. Since returning to Second Life three years ago, I’ve spent much of my time focused on growing a strong and thriving sisterhood. This year has come with growing pains, but we’ve shifted our focus and are aiming to put roleplay at the forefront of our organization.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">There is a thriving Greek Letter community in Second Life, and while I sometimes take issue with the wider community (a blog post for another day), I am often amazed by the ingenuity and creativity you can find within it. This past week really brought that home for me, as my organization helped fellow Greeks Kappa Theta Phi II with their fall vacation event, Chalet Valdoro Fall Festival. The week-long event focused on smaller roleplay activities, from wine tasting and horseback riding (which AΩM hosted) to scuba diving, karaoke, and even an actual horse derby. Each event gave participants the opportunity to get to know one another, crack a few jokes, and unwind. It offered everyone a chance to step away from the hustle and bustle of the real world and experience, in essence, a vacation they might not be able to afford or find time for otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/ac1c726a-3811-4cde-b158-0189d9358510/Valdoro+Air.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">It also gave me the chance to remember why my first foray into online gaming was virtual worlds and making connections. Over time, I have become less and less social. I\'ve always been shy, but over the last few years, I\'ve somewhat become a hermit. I stick to my group and only my group, rarely venturing into new experiences and heavily vetting anyone I deal with. And yes, when you think sorority, you think social butterflies, so I know there is a weird juxtaposition there, which is why this week has been huge for me. During our wine tasting event, we tried something new for AΩM with a “Hot Ones” style segment inspired by the YouTube series, and everyone loved it. Three other organizations have already said they want to join in next time since we plan to film future sessions and share them on social media. As a matter of fact, I spent much of this morning joking around with some of the other people staying at the resort on the dedicated Discord server. We\'ve talked about collaborating on another vacation event and working together on our upcoming charity drives. There has been a real building of community this week that reminds me it\'s okay to step outside your comfort zone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/3797d40c-f54d-456d-84f7-61288e34d897/Hot+Ones.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/8be48f08-8149-44b3-805e-a1ac80cf61c8/Brunch+Time.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/f3400f94-6f3d-46b2-9d7d-1f6475bdf87d/Crystal+Cave.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">Second Life is full of subcultures most people never see, and Greek life is one of its most enduring and creative. What this week reminded me is that behind every avatar, there’s a person looking for connection, laughter, and belonging. The bonds we build through roleplay might start as stories, but over time they become something very real. If you\'re curious about how organizations like Alpha Omega Mu operate, or want to learn more about Greek roleplay in Second Life, let me know in the comments. I’d love to share more about this side of the world in a future post.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1760050772090-M0870QX6B7U66AZ99ZXZ/Off+to+Italy.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

As we looked out over the bay, I was struck by two things: how vast this world is, and how I ended up here with these two men. They call me a friend, and I am still in awe of them. To listen to them honor one another was humbling. Though tonight their words were not meant for me, but for each other, I felt them all the same. The struggle to live up to what once was, to what others believe we should be, is a battle I know all too well.</p><p class="">Eight years of war have carried me to this place. The Broken Isles, Zandalar and Kul Tiras, the otherworldly Shadowlands, and the Dragon Isles. One battleground after another, each demanding more of me, more of us, but each leaving scars unique to the person. For me, there was no pause, no moment to breathe until now. Listening to Thrall and Anduin, I realize that in war, none of us walk free of the dead. We simply learn to live beside them.</p><p class="">For the first time I can feel the calm before the storm. There is a charge in the air, but the wind that carries it is gentle and warm. I do not know how long it will last. I wish it would last forever. I know it is foolish to think the fighting is over. Even when the battlefield falls silent, the war never truly ends. But in this quiet, I find myself yearning. Yearning to understand how I, a simple Farstrider from Quel’Thalas, ended up here. What was the moment? What was the choice?</p><p class="">And yet, it is silly of me to even ask those questions. I know the answer. I might be too afraid to speak them aloud, but I know them. Perhaps during this in-between, I should read some of my old journals, to look back with some perspective. They do say time helps to round out the edges. So maybe, in reading my journals, I can be gentler with my choices, and if not that, then maybe just gentler with myself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=""><em>Author’s Note:</em><br />This marks the start of Zanaia’s story. A quiet pause before she begins looking back on the choices that shaped her. This first journal entry takes place at the end of <em>The War Within</em> max-level campaign. The remaining journal entries will unfold alongside my playthrough of <em>Legion Remix,</em> tracing her path and the choices she made. For now, the plan is to write her story through <em>Legion.</em> After that, only time will tell.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/jpeg', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759708284120-B7JO818AWEK481F9PBKJ/Zanaia+Anduin+and+Thrall.jpg?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '1500', 'height': '844'}]}

And honestly? That feels amazing. Fun escapism is on the horizon, and I’m here for it.</p><h4>Legion Remix</h4><p class="">Aside from the power-leveling of alts and awesome rewards, I have a feeling there are a few reasons why this is one of the expansions they decided to remix. From what I understand, Legion was one of the more popular expansions, but the end of the expansion also has strong lore ties to what is going on currently. I feel like they want us to go back for the story, or at least I want to go back for the story, and I’m just hoping they want us to as well.</p><p class="">I also think this ties into why they did the Mists of Pandaria remix, which I unfortunately missed. After watching episode 5 of a lore and history series on YouTube, <em>Before the Mists: What was Pandaria really like?</em> from Quaylin, I’ve been thinking a lot about the Thunder King and all the lore and history in Pandaria. (Also, highly recommend that series if you like lore: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEyTJ3_GpaHRKIZ31190_-OuxCTfCafXZ&amp;si=b-EWYQynXZojo_0O" target="_blank">Quaylin’s Playlist</a>).</p><p class="">On top of that, I want to create a short story that might turn into something longer for a character I’ve had in the back of my mind. Most, if not all, of my WoW characters have a backstory, but there’s one story in particular I want to play around with. I’m hoping it’ll help get me back into writing creatively and also make me a better writer. You know, the whole “practice makes perfect” thing. The first in that series is coming out next week, and I’m pretty excited about it.</p><h4>Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity</h4><p class="">As most of my friends know, I adore Guild Wars 2. It has such rich and deep lore, plus it does a really great job of giving you the story via your hero panel if you’ve been away awhile and forgotten what you were up to. Kind of like a gaming bookmark. On top of that, the game is visually stunning, and they just do a lot of things well that I feel some games (<em>cough</em> World of Warcraft <em>cough</em>) take and use for their own. Warbands, I’m looking at you.</p><p class="">I also recently got some new friends into the game. It’s such a delight seeing new players enjoy Guild Wars 2. At first, one of my friends was like, <em>“Oh, I’ll play when you’re on.”</em> Then the next thing I know, they went out and started exploring on their own. I was so proud of them! They’re gamers, but MMOs haven’t really been their thing before. Sadly, Lost Ark was their first MMO, and I was like, <em>“Girl, that is not a game you want to start with.”</em></p><p class="">And of course, the Halloween event is right around the corner. In real life, I’m not the hugest Halloween fan, but there’s something about the Guild Wars 2 version that brings me so much joy. It’s campy and lighthearted, with just the right touch of spooky and decoration. It’s always a good time, and I’m really looking forward to experiencing it with my friends.</p><h4>Dispatch &amp; Anno 117</h4><p class="">I’m looking forward to Dispatch and Anno 117 for different but also similar reasons. They’re both the kinds of games I love to sink into when I’m feeling socially overwhelmed and want to game without any pressure.</p><p class=""><strong>Anno 117</strong> is a city builder (my absolute favorite genre) that will take us to the Roman Empire this time around. I can’t wait to experiment with creating a city that not only functions well but also looks beautiful.</p><p class=""><strong>Dispatch</strong>, on the other hand, is a story-driven, choices-matter RPG with a superhero twist. It features an incredible cast of actors, including two of my favorites from the voice acting world, Travis Willingham and Laura Bailey, as well as Jeffrey Wright. I LOVE Jeffrey Wright.</p><p class="">Both games are ones I know I’ll enjoy for months and months: replaying Dispatch to explore different choices, and perfecting the greatest city I can in Anno.</p><h4>WoW Player Housing</h4><p class="">I cannot even contain my excitement for player housing coming to WoW. I love to decorate in any game that lets me, which is why I adore city builders. Decorating scratches a creative itch for me since I can’t really do that in real life. HGTV is one of my all-time favorite channels, and I’ve basically been using games as my own personal HGTV show ever since The Sims 1 released.</p><p class="">The controls for decorating in WoW also look really similar to Second Life, which I have a lot of experience with. I even have an interior design business in SL, so I know I’ll be able to pull off some pretty amazing things. Once December 2nd rolls around, I’m going to be knee-deep in not only decorating my house but also leveling up the renown for it so I can have <em>all the things</em>!</p><p class="">I also plan to showcase myself decorating and the whole process that goes into it. That should be a lot of fun, kind of like a virtual MMO version of HGTV. Maybe that’ll be the moment I give YouTube another try… probably not, but at the very least I have this space to share all my design ideas.</p><h4>Countdown to Cozy Chaos</h4><p class="">So that is everything on the horizon until the end of the year. I haven’t had this much gaming content to bring me joy in such a long time. It’s hard not to be overwhelmed, but also it feels like being a kid waiting for their birthday or Christmas. Which is ironic because both my birthday and Christmas will be in the middle of all these things.</p><p class="">So if you need me between now and the holidays, you’ll find me happily lost in one of these worlds. Much excite, indeed.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759370554986-2X8R5BJOO4FD5A3AAJ7H/Much+Excite.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

To say I’ve blogged in the past would be an understatement. I’ve had several, all short lived, so we’ll see how this goes. Lately the quick bursts I toss on Mastodon don’t feel like enough. “But blogging? That’s so old school,” I hear you say. Yes, a blog. I know it’s 2025, but I don’t want to stream. Making YouTube videos isn’t on the table for now. So here we are. Fingers to keyboard, thoughts to screen.</p><p class="">So what is this place? Exactly what it says on the tin: a blog. A spot to pull together the ways I play, explore, and create in games. Sometimes that means roleplay stories where characters start writing themselves. Other times it’s screenshots that capture moments I want to hold onto. And sometimes it’s just me reflecting on the gaming experience, the joy, the chaos, the little obsessions of whatever I’m into that week.</p><p class="">My gaming tastes are all over the map, and that’s how I like it. One day I’m chasing achievements in Guild Wars 2. The next I’m running delves in World of Warcraft. Or desperately trying to keep the tiny people in Frostpunk from freezing to death. If it’s a world worth exploring or a puzzle worth figuring out, odds are I’ll end up there.</p><p class="">Ready Pixel One isn’t about guides or dissecting patch notes. It’s about what happens inside the games and inside my head while I play them. It’s the spark of a new MMO story, the random character I get too attached to, the screenshots I can’t stop taking. A mix of RP stories, personal reflections, and snapshots from the journey.</p><p class="">This first post is just me setting the stage. There’s more to come, characters to meet, worlds to visit, and plenty of pixels to share along the way.</p><p class="">So… Pixel One has joined the game.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759292672837-C734CUZR5FF3N0TH5AYW/Ready+Pixel+One.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step. It takes the grand, operatic elements of Star Wars and grounds them in a reality where power is brutal, where ecological concerns dictate the survival of entire civilizations, and where messiahs are as dangerous as they are revered.</p><p>While Star Wars draws inspiration from many sources, including Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films, and Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey, the imprint of Dune is undeniable. Lucas mixed multiple influences to craft his space opera, resulting in a faster-paced, action-driven narrative compared to Dune’s more introspective and politically complex storytelling. If anything, Dune is a deep meditation on power, religion, and fate, while Star Wars leans into mythic adventure and the battle between good and evil.&nbsp;</p><p>Both have left an indelible mark on science fiction, shaping how we imagine galaxies far, far away.&nbsp;</p><p>Here\'s how the team at <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StarWarsExplained" target="_blank">Star Wars Explained</a></em> put it: <em>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Uz-lKT7Jc" target="_blank">How Dune Continues to Inspire Star Wars.</a>"</em></p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><p>In the end, simply know that for those who fell in love with Star Wars, Dune stands waiting—a richer, more demanding, but ultimately rewarding universe to explore.<br /><br />Further readings:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/star-wars-ripped-off-dune" target="_blank">How \'Star Wars\' ripped off \'Dune\'</a> - via The Week</li><li><a href="https://nerdist.com/article/everything-star-wars-borrowed-from-dune/" target="_blank">Everything STAR WARS Borrowed From DUNE</a> - via Nerdist</li><li><a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars-movies-wouldnt-exist-without-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Movies Definitely Wouldn’t Exist Without Dune</a> - via Den of Geek</li><li><a href="https://www.cbr.com/dune-star-wars-similarities-inspiration/" target="_blank">Dune: 10 Ways the Series Inspired Star Wars</a> - via CBR</li><li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonyorlando52/cool-dune-and-star-wars-comparisons" target="_blank">17 "Star Wars" And "Dune" Similarities That Seemingly Tie The Franchises Together</a> - via BuzzFeed</li><li><a href="https://gamerant.com/star-wars-was-based-on-dune/" target="_blank">Star Wars Was Based On Dune, And It Shows </a>- via Game Rant</li></ul><p></p></div>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq7tgJpqN-t3AdtgsPbsCw9nr-n-fGT077bVls28t9Lu_zvWivNPoomrDmXU5GKk-rvgPFZM_xSQVq8zWlVCOloEA1_kPCqJQuq2tWcx3bSekID1l8VTebx20UU39KimjohC-qAiYovrOJEqbS1oeajcXre8zQD-PYedtdbDWoUckG6ePMIiTkDQ/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202025-03-05%2008.50.03%20-%20A%20dramatic%20sci-fi%20landscape%20divided%20into%20two%20distinct%20halves,%20symbolizing%20two%20different%20universes.%20On%20the%20left,%20a%20vast%20desert%20planet%20with%20towering%20san.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq7tgJpqN-t3AdtgsPbsCw9nr-n-fGT077bVls28t9Lu_zvWivNPoomrDmXU5GKk-rvgPFZM_xSQVq8zWlVCOloEA1_kPCqJQuq2tWcx3bSekID1l8VTebx20UU39KimjohC-qAiYovrOJEqbS1oeajcXre8zQD-PYedtdbDWoUckG6ePMIiTkDQ/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202025-03-05%2008.50.03%20-%20A%20dramatic%20sci-fi%20landscape%20divided%20into%20two%20distinct%20halves,%20symbolizing%20two%20different%20universes.%20On%20the%20left,%20a%20vast%20desert%20planet%20with%20towering%20san.webp" width="640" /></a></div><br />Frank Herbert’s Dune and George Lucas’ Star Wars share a striking number of similarities, from their world-building to their overarching themes.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess.

Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair. The film is set between Alien and Aliens, with a new cast, a new setting, and—hopefully—a return to the franchise’s roots.</p><p></p><p>Now, full disclosure: I haven’t seen it yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But from what I’ve gathered, early reviews suggest that Álvarez might actually get it. Critics have praised the film for leaning into the claustrophobic horror that made the original Alien so iconic. The visuals are supposedly striking, the tension palpable, and Cailee Spaeny’s performance as the lead, Rain, has been getting solid buzz. If Álvarez managed to capture that creeping dread of the original—without bogging it down in over-explained mythology—then we might just have a winner.</p><p>That said, not all reviews are glowing. Some critics feel the film leans too hard on nostalgia, offering little that’s truly new to the franchise. Others have called out a controversial digital recreation of Ian Holm’s Ash, arguing that it adds more distraction than depth. And there’s always the risk that Romulus ends up feeling like a well-shot rehash rather than a true evolution of the saga.</p><p>So, am I hopeful?&nbsp;</p><p>Cautiously, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like <b>Alien: Romulus</b> might finally be the course correction we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p><p>But I won’t know for sure until I see it myself.&nbsp;</p><p>And when I do, you can bet I’ll be back with my thoughts.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/s1280/Alien(1979).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/w640-h360/Alien(1979).png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p>When Alien burst onto the screen in 1979, it was the kind of film that crawled under your skin and stayed there. A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship?

The film is set between Alien and Aliens, with a new cast, a new setting, and—hopefully—a return to the franchise’s roots.</p><p></p><p>Now, full disclosure: I haven’t seen it yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But from what I’ve gathered, early reviews suggest that Álvarez might actually get it. Critics have praised the film for leaning into the claustrophobic horror that made the original Alien so iconic. The visuals are supposedly striking, the tension palpable, and Cailee Spaeny’s performance as the lead, Rain, has been getting solid buzz. If Álvarez managed to capture that creeping dread of the original—without bogging it down in over-explained mythology—then we might just have a winner.</p><p>That said, not all reviews are glowing. Some critics feel the film leans too hard on nostalgia, offering little that’s truly new to the franchise. Others have called out a controversial digital recreation of Ian Holm’s Ash, arguing that it adds more distraction than depth. And there’s always the risk that Romulus ends up feeling like a well-shot rehash rather than a true evolution of the saga.</p><p>So, am I hopeful?&nbsp;</p><p>Cautiously, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like <b>Alien: Romulus</b> might finally be the course correction we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p><p>But I won’t know for sure until I see it myself.&nbsp;</p><p>And when I do, you can bet I’ll be back with my thoughts.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-alien-or-how.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2025/03/the-rise-and-fall-of-alien-or-how.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA995DKPYpyGYYGgcQXThyphenhyphen0TcSffvinX0oCU1CQdkM-Zi7TBvOcLCQSaAC4Ik_lp2O7YzE4terOVygtIU9ook_-1S-AByWVeXLUAPv9It0rhU4RVrp0V6OJtwQmvicQAU6tIAfs7lKZ_jldwF-qYyWpPvvqC8SKS5-nGSVLK5odcCjGAK_xjgxRA/s72-w640-h360-c/Alien(1979).png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment. Here’s a summary of all six options to help you decide:</p><ul><li><strong>Craftsman:</strong> Increases natural resources by 25%, providing an edge in resource-heavy builds or for cities situated in resource-poor areas.</li><li><strong>Strategist:</strong> Reduces the likelihood of incidents like fires by 20%, keeping your city safe from disasters that can disrupt growth.</li><li><strong>Trader:</strong> Generates passive income from trade routes, a reliable choice if you plan on focusing on a strong economy.</li><li><strong>Politician:</strong> Allows two additional decrees to be issued at a lower cost, giving you more control over civic policies and faster access to certain upgrades.</li><li><strong>Philosopher:</strong> Boosts cultural satisfaction by 15%, making it easier to attract and retain a happy, thriving population.</li><li><strong>Priest:</strong> Citizens make regular offerings of random resources, adding a steady flow of materials that can supplement your supply chain.</li></ul><p>Each path offers distinct benefits depending on your playstyle. For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city. Here’s how to create a well-rounded cultural hub:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Add the ceramic workshop to a district close to residential zones, maximizing its impact on citizen satisfaction.</li><li>Balance satisfaction areas carefully: Focus on health and creativity early on to keep citizens productive and happy.</li><li>Use decorative statues within districts. Strategically placed statues improve attraction and encourage population growth.</li><li>Expand the radius of cultural buildings. When feasible, prioritize cultural buildings that have a broader impact radius to maximize their effectiveness.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">5. Developing Infrastructure: Production and Trade Routes</h2><p>Setting up trade routes is essential for generating income and balancing resources as your city expands. In the playthrough, the author wisely establishes trade routes to sell excess stone and sand for gold, which funds additional buildings and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>\' trade and production systems:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure to unlock and build both the Horreum, a large storehouse, as well as the Macellum, a large market which will open up Trade Routes. Without these two buildings trade will not be possible.</li><li>Identify surplus resources. Selling excess materials like stone and sand brings in steady gold income, which can be used to fund essential upgrades.</li><li>Upgrade production buildings. Increasing output from woodcutting camps and quarries helps meet the growing demand for building materials.</li><li>Create a balanced workforce. Avoid overspecializing in one resource, which could create shortages elsewhere in your economy.</li><li>Invest in a larger marketplace. Upgrading the marketplace opens up more trade routes, offering new opportunities to exchange goods and expand your economy.</li><li>Manage trade efficiently. Check each route’s profitability and ensure you’re getting maximum value from each transaction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">6. Advanced Growth: Reaching the Tier 2 City</h2><p>As your city grows, upgrading to a Tier 2 city brings new buildings and capabilities, allowing for even greater development. However, this stage also introduces new challenges, such as managing faction tensions. Here are a few ways to make the transition smoothly:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Construct safety-focused buildings. Building structures like arenas can help reduce incidents, which become more likely as factions develop tensions.</li><li>Invest in cultural influence points. Advancing through the ages improves your city’s reputation and allows for higher-level upgrades.</li><li>Manage faction relations. Keep an eye on faction satisfaction levels and address issues before they escalate into conflicts. Certain factions may have different needs or preferences.</li><li>Create additional districts. As new buildings become available, expand your residential and industrial districts to accommodate a growing population.</li><li>Save resources for key upgrades. Some Tier 2 buildings are expensive, so stockpile resources like wood, stone, and gold to avoid delays in construction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">7. Unlocking Wonders and Advanced Cultural Buildings</h2><p>Once you’ve secured your city’s basics, investing in wonders and advanced cultural buildings provides significant boosts. In the video, the author demonstrates how to build high-value structures like the arena and the Agoge Center to enhance influence. Here’s a guide to prioritize wonders effectively:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Focus on the Agoge Center&nbsp;or library to boost cultural influence. These buildings improve city-wide satisfaction and increase your cultural reach.</li><li>Place wonders in high-traffic areas to maximize their impact. Wonders near residential zones offer bonuses to more citizens.</li><li>Consider safety upgrades for wonder districts. Building defensive structures near wonders ensures they’re protected from incidents.</li><li>Save resources for construction. Wonders often require substantial materials, so plan to accumulate what you need before starting.</li><li>Regularly expand surveyor cabins. This allows you to build wonders farther out from the core, increasing your city’s total area.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8. Optimizing Faction Management and Decrees</h2><p>At this stage, you’ll encounter factions with unique demands. Managing these factions carefully, especially if they develop tensions, will become an important of your city management. Use decrees and policies to mitigate conflicts and enhance your city’s stability.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Issue decrees strategically. Certain decrees, such as increased food production, improve citizen satisfaction or reduce faction tensions.</li><li>Manage faction trust levels. High trust prevents conflicts, while low trust increases the likelihood of incidents and disputes.</li><li>Consider faction removal if tensions rise too high. Sometimes, expelling a problematic faction is more beneficial than dealing with constant conflicts.</li><li>Create buffers between rival factions. Placing neutral buildings or parks between contentious factions can reduce interactions and potential conflicts.</li><li>Balance decrees for all factions. Ensure that no single faction feels neglected, as this can quickly lead to dissatisfaction.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2><p>Building a successful city in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;requires a careful blend of resource management, cultural development, and strategic planning.

Between work (or trying to find my next role), family, and the general madness of daily life (soccer practices and games, lifts to here and there, the dog, etc.), finding the time to sit down and really immerse yourself in a game can feel like a luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s where city-building games come in, and let me tell you, they\'ve been a game-changer (pun totally intended).</p><span></span><h3 style="text-align: left;">The Magic of the Pause Button</h3><p>First off, let’s talk about one of the biggest perks of city-building games: the ability to pause or stop the game whenever you need to. Whether you\'re deep into a session of Cities: Skylines meticulously planning the perfect road network or trying to ensure your colonists survive another day in Surviving Mars, you can hit pause and step away without missing a beat. No need to worry about respawning in an FPS firefight or letting your team down in the middle of a MOBA match (I could write a whole posts on all the insults I\'ve taken from World of Tanks players).&nbsp;</p><p>These game wait for you, not the other way around.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Meditative Moments in Gaming</h3><p>Additionally, city-building games offer something incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world: a sense of peace and mindfulness. There’s a certain meditative quality to watching your city grow, whether it\'s a bustling metropolis in Cities: Skylines or a fragile colony on the brink of collapse in Frostpunk. You’re not just reacting to what’s happening on screen; you’re crafting something from the ground up, watching your creation evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s like a digital Zen garden, where each decision is a small stone you’re placing just so, bringing order to the chaos. Oh the hundreds of hours I\'ve spent in my Cities Skylines cities, beautifying them with parks, trees and endless landscaping.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Building Something That Lasts (well, sorta)</h3><p>Speaking of crafting, there’s something deeply satisfying about the “building something” aspect of these games. Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge. It’s not about speed or reflexes; it’s about foresight, planning, and adaptability. In Frostpunk, for example, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death for your citizens, adding a layer of moral complexity to the game. It’s a challenge that’s less about adrenaline and more about thoughtful consideration—a welcome break from the usual high-octane fare.</p><p>City-building games like Cities: Skylines, Farthest Frontier, Per Aspera, Frostpunk, and Surviving Mars offer a unique blend of strategy, relaxation, and creativity that’s perfect for casual gamers, especially gamer dads.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re games you can pick up and put down at your convenience, offering a sense of accomplishment without the stress. So next time you’re looking for a game that fits into your busy life, consider giving one of these a try.&nbsp;</p><p>You might just find it’s exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" width="640" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><br /></p><p>Here\'s a short list of some of the games I\'ve enjoyed over the years:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about" target="_blank"><i>Cities: Skylines II</i></a>&nbsp;(2023) - The sequel to the highly acclaimed Cities: Skylines, this game takes city-building to new heights with more advanced tools, deeper simulation, and enhanced graphics.</li><li><a href="https://www.farthestfrontier.com/" target="_blank"><i>Farthest Frontier</i></a> (2022) - A survival city-builder where you manage a frontier settlement, focusing on resource management, farming, and surviving harsh conditions.</li><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/surviving-the-aftermath/about" target="_blank"><i>Surviving the Aftermath</i></a> (2021) - A post-apocalyptic city-builder where you lead a group of survivors to rebuild society after a global catastrophe.</li><li><em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em> (2024) is a city-building game where you guide a city through 2,500 years of history across four eras.

It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge. It’s not about speed or reflexes; it’s about foresight, planning, and adaptability. In Frostpunk, for example, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death for your citizens, adding a layer of moral complexity to the game. It’s a challenge that’s less about adrenaline and more about thoughtful consideration—a welcome break from the usual high-octane fare.</p><p>City-building games like Cities: Skylines, Farthest Frontier, Per Aspera, Frostpunk, and Surviving Mars offer a unique blend of strategy, relaxation, and creativity that’s perfect for casual gamers, especially gamer dads.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re games you can pick up and put down at your convenience, offering a sense of accomplishment without the stress. So next time you’re looking for a game that fits into your busy life, consider giving one of these a try.&nbsp;</p><p>You might just find it’s exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaCqBLbGEDM904M2mi7gbIVwxYNV5pvyG1z-gF3e9S5is9jA-SH17FZhK0xxRJcWQb83QL5Oiq638dsCAFO9kk5YzBVJsimSiAYyX0Ubd1dZRYwQv3RaYgOJdp5-bDW1o4tZZ-OunSdAx0eWTPVfqXlHKoTPT9sy6txj4fEX0wb5H7EnxObWbT1g/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2008.30.59%20-%20A%20highly%20detailed%20landscape%20image%20inspired%20by%20the%20game%20Per%20Aspera,%20set%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20Mars.%20The%20focal%20point%20is%20a%20large,%20transparent%20dome%20with%20inhab.webp" width="640" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><br /></p><p>Here\'s a short list of some of the games I\'ve enjoyed over the years:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about" target="_blank"><i>Cities: Skylines II</i></a>&nbsp;(2023) - The sequel to the highly acclaimed Cities: Skylines, this game takes city-building to new heights with more advanced tools, deeper simulation, and enhanced graphics.</li><li><a href="https://www.farthestfrontier.com/" target="_blank"><i>Farthest Frontier</i></a> (2022) - A survival city-builder where you manage a frontier settlement, focusing on resource management, farming, and surviving harsh conditions.</li><li><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/surviving-the-aftermath/about" target="_blank"><i>Surviving the Aftermath</i></a> (2021) - A post-apocalyptic city-builder where you lead a group of survivors to rebuild society after a global catastrophe.</li><li><em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em> (2024) is a city-building game where you guide a city through 2,500 years of history across four eras.

Someone with extensive experience piloting TDs would likely tell you that the following are the best setups, crew skills, and playstyle strategies to help your team secure victory.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Vehicle Setup in Detail</h3><h4 style="text-align: left;">Equipment Choices</h4><p>For both the Hellcat and Super Hellcat, the goal is to maximize their strengths: mobility, concealment, and firepower.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Optics (Binocular Telescope or Coated Optics)</b>: Increasing your view range is critical. Spotting enemies before they spot you allows you to make informed decisions on when to shoot and when to relocate. The choice between Binocular Telescope and Coated Optics depends on your playstyle; Binoculars for more stationary play and Coated Optics for more active scouting and repositioning.</li><li><b>Gun Rammer</b>: Reducing your reload time significantly increases your Damage Per Minute (DPM), making you a bigger threat on the battlefield. Being able to shoot more frequently means you can exploit enemy tanks\' vulnerabilities more often.</li><li><b>Camo Net / Turbocharger</b>: The choice here is between enhancing your stealth with a Camo Net or boosting your mobility with a Turbocharger. The Hellcat, being slightly more geared towards ambush tactics, benefits greatly from a Camo Net. The Super Hellcat, with its enhanced mobility, can further capitalize on this with a Turbocharger, allowing for rapid repositioning and flanking maneuvers.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;">Crew Skills in Detail</h3><p>Developing your crew skills is crucial for maximizing the potential of your TDs.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Commander</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Sixth Sense</b> is non-negotiable for TDs. Knowing when you\'ve been spotted can save you from being quickly eliminated.</li><li><b>Recon</b> further boosts your view range, complementing your equipment choices.</li></ul><li><b>Gunner</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> makes you harder to detect, a key survival trait for a TD.</li><li><b>Snap Shot</b> improves your gun\'s accuracy during turret movements, allowing for more reliable shots after repositioning.</li></ul><li><b>Driver</b>:</li><ul><li><b>Smooth Ride</b> reduces the accuracy penalty when firing on the move, which can be beneficial in hit-and-run tactics.</li><li><b>Off-Road Driving</b> improves your mobility on various terrains, enhancing your ability to quickly get into position or escape danger.</li></ul><li><b>Loader</b>: If your TD has a dedicated loader,</li><ul><li><b>Camouflage</b> further enhances your stealth.</li><li><b>Safe Stowage</b> increases the durability of your ammo rack, reducing the chance of being taken out by a single hit.</li></ul></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Super Hellcat | World of Tanks Best Replays</h2><div style="text-align: center;"></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h2 style="text-align: left;">Gameplay Tactics in Detail</h2><h4 style="text-align: left;">Early Game</h4><p>The initial phase of the match is about gathering intelligence and taking key positions without being overly aggressive.</p><p><b>Scout and Reposition</b>: Use your mobility to reach forward positions quickly. Your goal is to gather as much information as possible on enemy movements for your team. After spotting, fall back to a safe distance before engaging.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Mid to Late Game</h4><p>As the match progresses, your role shifts towards exploiting enemy weaknesses and supporting your team from the second line.</p><p><b>Hit and Run</b>: Identify isolated targets or support teammates by targeting enemies focused on your allies. After firing, immediately relocate to avoid counter-fire, especially from enemy artillery or hidden TDs.</p><p><b>Supporting Heavies</b>: Position yourself behind or beside your team’s heavy tanks. From here, you can safely engage enemies that are distracted by your frontline, using your superior DPM to whittle them down.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Map Movement and Positioning</h3><p>Understanding each map\'s key features and sight lines is crucial. Use terrain to your advantage, keeping in mind that your primary goal is to support your team by dealing damage from concealed positions or by exploiting enemy flanks.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Use Terrain: Always be mindful of hills, ridges, and other terrain features that can provide cover or concealment. Being able to shoot without exposing your tank is a key skill for TD players.</li><li>Avoid Open Fields: Open areas are death zones for lightly armored vehicles like the Hellcat and Super Hellcat. Move from cover to cover and stay aware of potential threats like enemy TDs and artillery.</li><li>High Ground Advantage: High ground not only provides a better view of the battlefield but also makes it harder for enemies to hit your tank. Use elevation to your advantage whenever possible.</li></ul><p></p><p>By focusing on these strategies and continuously practicing and refining your skills, you\'ll greatly contribute to your team\'s efforts and enjoy success in your Hellcat and Super Hellcat in World of Tanks.</p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How a Super Hellcat should tag along with...</h2><div><span><div>The Hellcat, with its blend of mobility, firepower, and limited armor, can significantly benefit from coordinating with certain types of vehicles on the battlefield. Here’s a breakdown of which vehicles a Hellcat should consider partnering with and why:</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Medium Tanks</h3><div>Medium tanks are versatile and can perform a wide range of roles, making them excellent partners for the Hellcat. Their balance of speed, armor, and firepower allows them to effectively scout, flank, and engage enemies at various ranges. A Hellcat can support medium tanks by providing additional firepower from a second line or by exploiting openings created by the mediums’ aggressive maneuvers. This pairing can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions, moving to support weakened flanks or to capitalize on enemy vulnerabilities.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heavy Tanks</h3><div>While heavy tanks lack the Hellcat’s mobility, they make up for it with superior armor and firepower. Teaming up with heavy tanks allows the Hellcat to operate from behind the frontline, using the heavies as a shield while it delivers precise shots. This partnership is especially effective in areas with good cover and long sightlines, where the Hellcat can use its excellent gun to support the heavy tanks without exposing itself to enemy fire. The Hellcat should avoid blocking the retreat paths of allied heavy tanks and remain ready to reposition if the enemy breaks through the frontline.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Other TDs</h3><div>Pairing with other TDs, especially those with strong frontal armor, can create a formidable defensive line that can deter enemy advances. The Hellcat, with its good mobility, can act as a scout or flanker for this group, identifying targets for the more heavily armored TDs to engage. However, this requires good communication and coordination to ensure that the Hellcat does not become isolated or targeted by enemy artillery.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Artillery</h3><div>While not directly tagging along with artillery, a Hellcat can play a crucial role in protecting these valuable assets from enemy scouts and light tanks. By staying relatively close to friendly artillery, the Hellcat can use its mobility and firepower to intercept and eliminate threats to the team’s artillery pieces, ensuring they can continue to support the team effectively.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Light Tanks</h3><div>A somewhat less common but potentially effective partnership can be formed with light tanks. Light tanks excel in scouting and can quickly identify key enemy positions. A Hellcat following a light tank at a safe distance can capitalize on the scouting information, using its accurate gun to take out spotted enemies before they can react. However, this requires the Hellcat to stay alert and ready to move, as the light tank’s fast-paced scouting can lead them into rapidly changing situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>When pairing with any vehicle, the key for the Hellcat driver is to maintain situational awareness and adapt to the battle’s flow. The Hellcat\'s strength lies in its ability to deliver impactful damage from positions where it is not easily targeted. Effective communication with teammates and choosing the right moments to strike or relocate are crucial for leveraging the Hellcat’s capabilities to their fullest.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">How NOT to play the Super Hellcat!</h2></span></div><p style="text-align: left;">One of the worst ways to play the Hellcat in World of Tanks is to treat it like a frontline brawler or a heavy tank. The Hellcat is equipped with a powerful gun and excellent mobility but suffers from very thin armor and a relatively open turret design, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fire from almost all types of weapons it encounters on the battlefield.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Mistakes in Playing the Hellcat as a Frontline Tank:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Engaging in Direct Firefights: Attempting to trade shots with enemy tanks, especially heavies or well-armored mediums and TDs, is a quick way to get destroyed. The Hellcat\'s armor is insufficient to absorb hits, and its relatively large profile for a TD makes it an easy target when exposed.</li><li>Ignoring Cover and Concealment: Failing to use the terrain, bushes, and other forms of cover to hide your tank and mask your movements negates one of the Hellcat\'s main strengths – its ability to strike unseen. Being visible on the front lines means you\'ll likely be one of the first targets to be fired upon.</li><li>Static Gameplay: Staying in one position for too long, especially on the front lines, can make you an easy target for enemy artillery and tanks. The Hellcat thrives on its ability to relocate quickly, providing support where it\'s needed and avoiding return fire.</li><li>Not Using its Mobility: The Hellcat\'s speed is a key feature that allows it to flex across the map, responding to threats, reinforcing failing flanks, or exploiting gaps in the enemy lines. Playing it in a stationary, frontline role wastes this potential, making the tank much less effective than it could be.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Avoid These Mistakes:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Play to Your Strengths: Use the Hellcat\'s mobility and excellent gun handling to engage enemies from unexpected angles, relocate frequently to avoid being targeted, and always look for opportunities to support your team from a distance or the second line.</li><li>Stay Aware: Keep an eye on the mini-map and be ready to move if you\'re in danger of being flanked, or if there\'s a more advantageous position you can take to support your team.</li><li>Engage Wisely: Choose your battles carefully. Look for targets that are engaged with your teammates, isolated, or presenting their weaker armor to you. Avoid head-on engagements with tanks that can easily outgun or outarmor you.</li></ul><p></p><p>By avoiding the frontline brawler playstyle and focusing on mobility, stealth, and strategic engagement, you\'ll greatly increase your effectiveness and survivability in the Hellcat, turning it into a formidable asset for your team.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final thoughts...</h2><p>Mastering the Hellcat and Super Hellcat requires patience, good positioning, and an understanding of when to engage or retreat. Remember, your primary role is to support your team by providing accurate and timely damage from a distance or flanking. Avoid direct confrontations with heavier tanks unless you have a clear advantage or support. By following these strategies and adjusting your playstyle based on the battle\'s flow, you\'ll become a valuable asset to your team and help secure victory on the battlefield.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p>Jumping back into World of Tanks after long hiatus, and a big update felt a bit like a cold splash of water yesterday - especially when I dove straight into battle with my Super Hellcat and ended up more like a skittish kitten hiding in the bushes (literally) than the fierce TD I should\'ve been.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, my gameplay was rusty, and the match didn’t go well at all.

While Fincher\'s film has gained appreciation over time for its atmospheric and stylistic contributions to the franchise, Gibson\'s unproduced screenplay remains a fascinating "what if" scenario that hints at a different direction the "Alien" saga could have taken, potentially offering a more direct continuation of the themes and characters that fans had grown to love in the first two films.</div><div><p></p><p><a href="https://www.audible.ca/pd/Alien-III-Audiobook/B07QWZH5J6?bp_o=true&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAt5euBhB9EiwAdkXWOzX75ZpJJpU6Dii1CcYZWuvJqkjite68jE0tYKh79hvBv7VOWtw46xoCvOgQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;ipRedirectOverride=true&amp;language=en_CA&amp;overrideBaseCountry=true&amp;source_code=GDGPP30DTRIAL548011723005L" target="_blank">Audible\'s audio drama Alien 3 was a brilliant dramatization of the Gibson screenplay</a>, and I highly recommend you give it a listen!</p></div></div>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/exploring-what-if-review-of-william.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/exploring-what-if-review-of-william.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijZHVqQ4oyLsuTd86BXSKGK7ouqMc8C27X9MnhsA4O-V34biRXo4AP55knQnbagEaStNOzUUy4IXGMA_e_YWULmNyD1v5r_Gp7k5smPivZITfQaALFI4CjVeC7Jdop5DvN7NUMB9VoLs4Ozxh4xw2qL4YCJry9GqUMaiplxGjNOOrKANt6D5_2hg/s72-w640-h360-c/Sigourney-Weaver-and-xenomorph-in-Alien-3.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

It is based off of my ToC HTML design and may break in fun an unusual ways if you decide to do anything differently, but it works! When I get a chance I\'ll put up a separate post with my ToC design because it\'s kind of scattered amid past theme update posts. For now, this is the basic type of structure it will generate:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;toc&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h2</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;toc-head&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Contents:<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">ol</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;toc-list&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;#h2&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>H2 Level Heading<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">ul</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;toc-list&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;#h3&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>H3 Subheading<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">ul</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;#h2-2&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Another H2 Heading<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">ol</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n<div class="toc">\n<h2 class="toc-head">Contents:</h2>\n<ol class="toc-list"><li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#h2">H2 Level Heading</a>\n<ul class="toc-list"><li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#h3">H3 Subheading</a></li></ul></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#h2-2">Another H2 Heading</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>And you can grab the CSS from the page source or wait until I make a real post about it in a day or two.</p>\n<p>Yes, the toc-list class on the lists is probably superfluous, it\'s a remnant of when I was trying to figure out why nested lists were doing so many weird things (tl;dr: browser default styles). I know more about selectors now.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I\'ve been hunting for a better method to generate complex table of contents from a markdown file since I did <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-09-16-continental-op-slang/">the Continental Op slang post</a>. For the ToC in that post I wrote all those headings and links out by hand and it was not great.</p>\n<p>I use <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a> to write in and I\'m not looking to change writing software. I like it. It does what I want, nothing more or less. However, if you want to insert a ToC it does so by inserting a <code>[TOC]</code> block which is only generated into an actual list when you export the file using pandoc to something else. And the resulting TOC HTML as generated by the default styles is really not great. I could write a new style to apply, but that is a lot of work for just one element.</p>\n<p>So for <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20-bearblog-css-infobox-v1/">the long Infobox post</a> with complicated headings I tried a couple online generators. I\'m not a huge fan of using them because I don\'t really need or want my text to be captured by some random stranger, but it\'s better than the alternative. And the text itself <em>is</em> going online on the open internet eventually.</p>\n<p>The first one I tried didn\'t handle the special characters in the headings properly. The second one I tried worked. It\'s <a href="https://github.com/derlin/bitdowntoc">BitDownToc by derlin</a>. You can download the tool and run it locally, but also, ugh. I\'ll think about it. If I can get it to work it will save some steps.</p>\n<p>For now, here\'s the process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Drop Markdown text into the converter.</li>\n<li>Copy out the resulting plain Markdown list ToC.</li>\n<li>Paste into a draft post in Bearblog.</li>\n<li>Save Draft. Open Preview.</li>\n<li>Open View Source and find the ToC and copy it out.</li>\n<li>Paste it into the Markdown file and find-and-replace add in my styling classes. Wrap it in a div.</li>\n<li>Copy and paste result back into Bearblog editor. Save Draft.</li>\n<li>Double-check Preview.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The only thing I changed from the Default settings is set the character used for the list to just <code>-</code>. If I want a numbered list replacing the resulting <code>ul</code> with <code>ol</code> is faster.</p>\n<p>It\'s not great, but it\'s faster than hand-writing all those links, believe it or not.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20-generating-a-toc">Generating a ToC</a> last edited: 1\xa0day, 5\xa0hours ago</div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20-bearblog-css-infobox-v1" title="Bearblog CSS: Infobox - Version 1">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': "I've been hunting for a way to generate complex table of contents from markdown files for a while.", 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-20-generating-a-toc/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': "I've been hunting for a way to generate complex table of contents from markdown files for a while."}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'bearblog', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-20T20:35:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=20, tm_hour=20, tm_min=35, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=293, tm_isdst=0)}

I don\'t want to have to copy and paste or write all that every time I want to put one in a post. However, as I would learn later, if I had just done it with nested divs I wouldn\'t have run into about five thousand problems. (This is foreshadowing).</p>\n<p>I spent a lot of time agonizing over the value of using a svg icon vs just a unicode character, and the value of using a background image in a div vs using <code>:before</code>. In terms of accessibility they\'re both basically invisible to a screen reader so something else has to be done to announce that the text is meaningful in some way. Maybe we can find some way to do it that semantically makes sense and doesn\'t require an <code>aria-label</code>?</p>\n<p>They can be made with a <code>blockquote</code>, that\'s a ready-made box for putting text in. But semantically misleading.</p>\n<p>I found an example that used <code>aside</code> that seemed like a good idea. But then I read up on that and it doesn\'t quite fit semantically either. This isn\'t something "tangentially related" (although I do that plenty too) it\'s an interruption or break in the text. So when I actually clicked through from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/aside">MDN</a> to the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-aside-element">HTML spec</a> I had to pause. How are <em>they</em> doing their little callout boxes for notes?</p>\n<p>Well. It\'s just a <code>p</code> .</p>\n<p>😐</p>\n<p>I\'m not sure I really like that to be honest. (I should have listened to this feeling.)</p>\n<p>But you can\'t argue with the literal HTML spec.</p>\n<p>And I tried it and it worked fine. (At first.)</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;infobox info&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Hello, world!

People seem to have a lot of different opinions on the best way to flag content in the middle of other content. I have yet to find anything by an actual screenreader / keyboard-only user saying what they prefer, though, that is really what I would like to find and am still hunting for amid the absolutely disgusting amount of "beginner web development" slop.</p>\n<p>What I <em>imagine</em> would be ideal is to have some sort of role akin to a heading or a <code>hr</code> that would flag this as a stopping point and not just another paragraph. Because, obviously, they may wish to stop to read the warnings before reading the rest of the content.</p>\n<p>However, there are no ARIA roles that make sense for something like this. The only option is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/region_role">the generic "region" role</a> with an appropriate aria-label to describe what the region is.</p>\n<p>Inserting a heading to provide a natural stopping point and built-in aria label is the easiest option. The reason why I resisted it is because it complicates the heading hierarchy. A <code>H3</code> should always follow a <code>H2</code> and precede an <code>H4</code>. So what header I use in the box depends on where in the document it is placed. This is going to be annoying. Is the sin of breaking the header hierarchy better or worse than just leaving it alone?</p>\n<p>This is what lead me to using <code>strong</code> which <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/strong">MDN actually explicitly says</a> can be used for indicating "notes or warnings within the text of a page". Huzzah! There was a simple solution all along. Unfortunately this small victory just lead me further down the path to destruction…</p>\n<h2 id="the-consequences-of-making-a-paragraph-a-flexbox">The Consequences of Making a Paragraph a Flexbox</h2><p>I gave the paragraph <code>display: flex;</code> so that it would be easier to align relative to the stuff outside it and the stuff inside it.</p>\n<p>However, I eventually discovered that if you make a paragraph a flexbox every item wrapped in tags within it becomes it\'s own flex child. That includes html tags like bold, italic, emphasis, and strong and even strings of text separated by a <code>br</code> are separate children. I\'m guessing this happens because they\'re all <code>span</code> underneath it all.</p>\n<p>At first this was fine and good. I already wanted to use  <code>strong</code> to put text like "spoiler" next to the icon on the left and it being a child item means it naturally floats to the left centred the same as the <code>:before</code> content. I could have stopped there and said you just can\'t use any other tags inside these special paragraph boxes without it looking weird and called it a day.</p>\n<p>But of course I did not call it a day.</p>\n<h2 id="display-is-pretty-complicated-actually">Display is Pretty Complicated Actually</h2><p>I did a lot of reading of the documentation on MDN about flexbox, grid, and then the display property itself. As it turns out, <code>display:</code> is technically two values: <code>display-inside</code> and <code>display-outside</code>. Outside refers to how the block is interacting with the elements around it and inside sets how the <em>contents</em> of the block will be laid out. This was less important back in the day when we were just changing things to be either block or inline but becomes more relevant with grid and flex.</p>\n<p>If you set something to be <code>display: flex</code> you are actually setting <code>display: block flex</code> such that the outside of the box is now a block and the inside is flex and the first-order children are on the outside a block and the inside a flex. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/multi-keyword_syntax_of_display">The page on MDN that explains all this</a> actually uses <code>em</code> within a <code>span</code> as an example of how this works. But still doesn\'t quite resolve my issue.</p>\n<p>How do I make <em>some</em> child items of a flexbox forget they are a block and sit inline nicely as they are supposed to?</p>\n<p>Obviously the first thing I tried was to set it as <code>display: inline</code> but it did not respect that even with an <code>!important</code>.</p>\n<p>I tried the strange and half-supported <code>display: contents</code> which briefly gave me hope. It functionally does what I want to do, which is remove the "boxiness" of an element. However the consequences of using it are that the actual contents of the tag disappear from the html. They\'re rendered, but if you use inspect the html the text is literally not there, as is the case when you set a <code>content:</code> property in CSS.</p>\n<p>You can test this out on this page by using developer tools, select some random element, and then add the <code>display: contents;</code> property to it. Then look at the HTML pane and see how the tags are now "empty". So, in short, this is not a good solution.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I think it is literally impossible to make the first order child of a flexbox stop being a block.</p>\n<h3 id="fun-with-selectors">Fun with Selectors</h3><p>I am going to summarize a lot of time spent fighting with <code>:first-child-of-type</code> and say: yes it is possible to select only the first <code>strong</code> and style it to be centred to the left by the icon, but because it is <em>not</em> possible to make all the rest of the tags in the box behave normally inline it is a moot point.</p>\n<h2 id="last-ditch-attempt-to-use-paragraph">Last Ditch Attempt to Use Paragraph</h2><p>Giving up on making the paragraph a flexbox entirely, can we align the things inside the box such that it looks like it did with the flex?</p>\n<p>In short, not really. We can use padding and relative positioning and all the usual old fashioned stuff to make the icon and text roughly vertically centred within the box and use a hanging indent to push any wrapping text away from the symbol at the beginning, but it is very finnicky and doesn\'t look great to my eyes. I gave up on it pretty quick. But it can be done.</p>\n<h3 id="flex-less-css">Flex-less CSS</h3><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">infobox</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">border-radius</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">padding</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0.65</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">text-indent</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">hanging</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c">/* the key addition */</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n\n<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">info</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">background</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">--color-info</span><span class="p">);</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n\n<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">info</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nd">before</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">content</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">\'\\2042\'</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">--size-title</span><span class="p">);</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">padding-right</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0.65</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">300</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n\n<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">warn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">border</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">solid</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">rgba</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">229</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">77</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">46</span><span class="p">);</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">background</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">rgba</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">229</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">77</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">46</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0.4</span><span class="p">);</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n\n<span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">warn</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nd">before</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">content</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s1">\'\\26A0  CW:\'</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">--size-h2</span><span class="p">);</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">padding-right</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0.65</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="w">\t</span><span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">600</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n<h2 id="hindsight-is-2020">Hindsight is 20/20</h2><p>With the benefit of hindsight, all this probably makes sense within the way that flexbox is intended to be used. Second-order children of a flexbox <em>aren\'t</em> flex, and that non-intuitive break in the inheritance makes more sense when you go through all the shit I did. The problem I\'m running into with this is because a <code>p</code> is basically a <code>div</code> with various <code>span</code>s within it. Normally, you would almost always put a chunk of text within a div into a <code>p</code> tag, meaning the <code>strong</code> type formatting tags become second order children and therefore sit inline the way they\'re supposed to.</p>\n<p>If you\'re making a static box with text like a button or a modal window you can just put the text into the div without a paragraph wrapper and make sure all the words are in the correct place with <code>position:</code> , which automagically breaks the flex curse. However if you want to be able to change the text inside the box the way I do you can\'t be positioning individual words with css. I mean maybe you can but it\'s beyond me.</p>\n<h2 id="the-final-paragraph-version">The Final Paragraph Version</h2><p>So here is the final result of using a paragraph as a div. If you choose to use this HTML/CSS combo you will just have to remember not to put any other tags within the box. If all you want to do is e.g. make one "spoilers" box and put some fixed text into it and copy paste that into your posts this will work fine. If you want to be able to change the text in the box depending on the situation you will have to wait for the second edition of this infobox after I gave up on using the paragraph as a wrapper.</p>\n<p>I wanted a general info callout type thing and a more attention-grabbing box for content warnings and spoiler warnings. So there\'s two classes per box, but you could add as many classes as you want different types of box, e.g. a "spoiler" box, a "NSFW" box, an "important note" box, etc.</p>\n<p>Also if you want multiple lines you need to put a <code>br</code> in because, obviously, the text is inside a paragraph already.</p>\n<h3 id="about-unicode-symbols">About Unicode Symbols</h3><p>I originally tried using the <a href="https://symbl.cc/en/1F6C8/">unicode symbol for information (i in a circle)</a> for my information box, however as it turns out Android\'s default fonts (Roboto) simply do not actually include a big chunk of unicode. Mind-boggling oversight by the world\'s most widely adopted mobile OS. Apparently most of the third-party Android OSs patch in more unicode, but not the Pixel. This particular "information" symbol was added in 2014 so they\'ve certainly had time to do it. Once again, what is the point of having a standard if nobody adheres to the standard. The <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter web font</a> I\'m using also does not include that symbol so it just displays as a blank rectangle on Android, regardless of browser. So I had to use something else. Something to consider if you are wanting to change the symbol I used – make sure that the glyph is included in one of your web fonts.

I\'ve put together four options. These colours are all taken from the <a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/scales">Radix colour scales</a>, but somewhat arbitrarily. I also learned about doing <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp">transparency with rgba colours</a> so one of these uses that. I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp">a colour converter</a> to go from hex to rgb values.</p>\n<p>I\'ve used codepen this time like one of the cool kids so you can actually see all the options in action.</p>\n<h3 id="0-basic-html-and-css">0.

But this post is already 3000 words so I\'m splitting off the actual solution and that will go up later. I don\'t like to say this was a complete failure because I did learn a lot in the process, and the final product of the "using p as a box" experiment <em>does</em> work as long as you respect the caveats. But it didn\'t actually do what I wanted it to do, so it\'s not a full success either. A smarter person perhaps would have given up much earlier and just used the obvious method of nested divs instead of spending hours trying to solve a problem that is unsolvable because they were so invested in the idea of using <code>p</code> as a box.

It has been taken down from my preferred read online site so I had to scramble to make sure it was on my private anime/manga tracker. I don\'t think it\'s worth raving about, but it\'s fun for the first 10-ish volumes, especially Nao\'s evolution as a player, and then sort of runs out of steam. The author doesn\'t seem particularly strong at writing meaningful character arcs and it\'s impossible to make the ultimate bad guys interesting or satisfying.</p>\n<p>I do think it has some of the best games of all the death game manga I recommended, in terms of being a simple concept that becomes more complicated the more you think about it, but as a result the readers often have to spend a lot of time keeping track of numbers and rules. There are quite a few games invented by this author like 17 card poker I would love to try IRL. I\'m not saying I\'d be good at it, but it would be interesting.</p>\n<p>I don\'t really like reading manga on my phone, it\'s too small to see the details and zooming in and scrolling is annoying. This is probably why longstrip Korean webtoons have over-taken manga in general popularity. But having my laptop in bed with me to read on it is bad for the sleeping habits. It\'s too tempting to do other stuff. I\'ve never been tempted to own a tablet or e-reader but I guess this is the use case. I wonder if any charity organization near here has some e-waste crap one laying around I could have for free or near-free.</p>\n<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><h3 id="the-celebrity-traitors-s01e03-04">The Celebrity Traitors S01E03-04</h3><p>I am really enjoying this a lot. The producers clearly understand that what we the audience want to see is national treasure level celebrities get dirty and covered in water and stinky bird feathers. There have been some amazing individual moments as well. A++ on that. The puzzles have been pretty good, much better than Series 3 but probably still need to get a bit harder as the days go on because right now the ones who are actually good at missions are being hindered by the people who are not. I guess it depends on who gets taken out.</p>\n<p>The Faithful have honestly been doing better than the regular show\'s players, who usually waste the first 6 of 12 episodes coming up with ridiculous theories based on nothing, but the Celebs have the advantage of actually knowing each other\'s personalities before going in. They also know how producers think – hence the "big dog" theory. Someone even made the point of "just because someone\'s name came up and we didn\'t eliminate them doesn\'t mean they\'re automatically not a Traitor" which is something I and probably many people have been screaming at the TV (esp. Series 1).</p>\n<p>But also the producers know that the game isn\'t fun unless the Traitors have a legit chance to win, so the Faithful can never be allowed to eliminate them all until about the last two episodes. If this was a death game it wouldn\'t just be about figuring out who the traitors are, but also <em>keeping</em> certain people Traitors that you think will take other Faithful out and keep you in. If you eliminate a Traitor early you\'re actually shooting yourself in the foot because then they will recruit someone, and that new Traitor will be in a very strong position having already "proved" they are a Faithful.</p>\n<p>I can\'t believe I\'m trying to pirate podcast extras, but since the BBC geofenced the BBC Sounds app you need a UK IP address to access any content on it. People have posted various VPN-related workarounds, but nobody has actually ripped the video/audio files. So far as I can tell anyway. Argh. I wish they would at least stop taunting me by mentioning the extras at the end of every regular Uncloaked episode.</p>\n<p>I would love to find someone to talk about this show with but I don\'t want to venture onto the mainstream social medias 😓  I want to talk about fear of power and dictatorships and unconscious bias and cognitive dissonance. I also would really love if a linguist did a survey of the show and picked up on all the words and phrases that get invented or just repeated through the course of the game.</p>\n<h3 id="sportsball">Sportsball</h3><p>Hackey has officially started but who cares because I\'m still on the Blue Jay train. I can\'t appreciate all the nuance of baseball, but I\'m learning things. I hope they win, but if they do they will have to beat Shohei Ohtani. Having your best offensive player also be your best defensive player is almost unheard of in pro sports. Mostly because most sports don\'t have separate offensive and defensive phases like baseball, but still.</p>\n<h3 id="bake-off-canada-junior-bake-off">Bake Off Canada / Junior Bake Off</h3><p>A new season has started, the third episode has aired. There are a few seasons on <a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/the-great-canadian-baking-show">CBC Gem</a>.

The author wrote Lord El-Melloi II\'s Case Files which isn\'t particularly an outstanding piece of writing but it does mean Waver and Iskander so I\'m in.</p>\n<p>The special event servant on the banner is Ptolemaios aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter?useskin=vector">Ptolemy I Soter</a>. Not the philosopher, the guy who started the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. I somehow never realized the Ptolemy who took over Egypt and built the Library of Alexandria was also the guy who ultimately won the war of succession after Alexander\'s death. See, you can learn things from waifu gacha games.</p>\n<p>I\'ve started the story and am going to progress as much as I can without grinding. Then grind at the end when it\'s more efficient. It\'s interesting and the turn based strategy is a fun way to play. But I\'m too used to being able to try moving a character and then cancelling and moving them back before the end of the turn, I have to remember to think before moving.</p>\n<p>Because I\'ve been spending so much time on Fantasy Life it\'s hard to play a second grindy game at the same time. The event goes until November 4th and clearing these kinds of events usually takes me at least two weeks so I can\'t put it off too much.</p>\n<h2 id="living">Living</h2><p>Still have not made progress on job stuff or gotten completely back on track with the to do list, but have done a bit of cleaning. And I am trying. I just find it too easy to end up sitting writing for hours things that I probably will never post online. Or having a random thought and then getting sucked into that, like the other day when I remembered Nova Launcher for Android is basically kaput and I wanted to try an alternative FOSS launcher Lawnchair. Anything is easier than working on jobs.</p>\n<p>It does not help that with my inability to fall asleep at a decent hour I end up sleeping through half the day and don\'t have a lot of productive hours.

I think some crucial points are:</p>\n<p>a) Win10 computers didn\'t just blow up or disappear on Oct 15 when support ended. People are still going to keep using them. They\'ll be a big malware target, but it also always have been. Taking sensible security measures will still probably work to protect most people most of the time.\nb) The majority of e-waste is going to come from small/underfunded institutions who legally can\'t be running an unpatched OS and can\'t afford to pay the subscription fee for security updates (and migrating to Linux would be a years-long project even if you could convince them to do it).\nc) this is a perfect example of how "consumer demand" isn\'t actually the primary driver of production. At least not the simplified Macro Econ 101 way that most people believe it does. <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/?ref=404media.co">45% of Windows users in July 2025 still, clearly, preferred Win10 over Win11</a>.

The idea being to target those things specifically to try to get them in the archive.

Because I do not remember any of the regex I used to know I found this tool. It took a bit for my brain to wrap around how it works, but once I did it\'s a nice quick way to do simple regex-es from a known string. You still have to know basically how regex works in order to use it though.</p>\n<p><a href="https://blog.avas.space/privacy-value/">how can we (re)teach the importance of privacy?</a> by ava</p>\n<p>I think most of the people reading this blog are going to agree that in the war against privacy, Facebook won, and that\'s a bad thing for society generally. But it\'s also the valorization of the monetization of self-surveillace that really bothers me. Is it down to the feelings of powerlessness, that you might as well bare all and make some money from it because the companies are going to take it anyway? Is it the natural consequence of gig work, where if you don\'t have a car or a skill that is easily marketable via app maybe you can just sell yourself?

Because while higher level items do tend to drop better materials, it\'s the difference between your stat and the enemy/node\'s stat that seems to influence drop rates a lot more. If I\'m level 70 and do a level 30 ore I get way more drops than if I\'m level 70 and do the exact same ore at level 70.</p>\n<p>Its the same for Ginormosia. You need to hit Rank 5 for certain enemies to start spawning, but it seems like after that nothing new appears. Maybe that will change with the upcoming DLC. But it means that keeping the areas at rank 5 or 6 is optimal if what you want is to actually farm drops. If you want more EXP maybe higher level enemies are better for that, but honestly my levelling only started slowing down at 70, the EXP curve seems to steepen after that. But if you\'re careful and well equipped you can still beat enemies that are at 80 as a level 60-70. You burn through a lot of healing items and food and need to be careful about SP consumption, but it\'s very doable. The real problem is not getting drops from those high level enemies because my level is similar or lower.</p>\n<p>For the record, my best combat team is usually me as Magician doing offense, Sloane doing heals, Glenn who has a buff against crown enemies, and either Odin, who has high aggro and defence, or Laura if the enemy is Dark element because her Light move does big numbers.</p>\n<p>Going back to the treasure grove, I\'ve figured out the strategy a bit better. It\'s a lot kinder than most randomized dungeons in games I\'ve played. You can swap team at each floor, you can move through floors you\'ve already cleared automatically, and you can leave whenever you want with no penalty. And the dungeon layout stays the same so you don\'t even have to start again at the beginning. Honestly it\'s even easier than the actual dungeons in this game because you can just open the menu and leave whenever instead of having to run all the way out.</p>\n<p>The only disadvantage is if you find a good room you can\'t just farm it – but the internet says that if you don\'t actually complete the mission for the floor and quit the dungeon it doesn\'t get greyed out and you can just go back in. I haven\'t tested it yet though and I\'ve already read wrong information about this game online before. Like that dark energy and slates only drop from shadow enemies once you hit floor 500. Nope! I just finished floors 200-300 and got plenty.</p>\n<p>So now that I\'ve finished getting all the Ginormosia areas up to Rank 5 or higher I\'ve just been spending a bit of time there toggling the towers back and forth to see if I can get a legendary to spawn and farming so I can restock the veggie stands and make acorns. Which I can then spend on the ultra-rare materials and recipes from the travelling merchants.</p>\n<p>I am going to continue pushing down into the Treasure Grove until I hit something too difficult to get past, but it is really tempting to just keep replanting at floor 300. I\'m getting great stuff every time I go in there. It\'s a grab bag but it feels like a better use of time than killing 5000 bees and collecting 5000 pine logs that I don\'t need.</p>\n<p>I\'ve also collected enough Slates now to get a ton of new recipes I don\'t have the materials to make and unlocked two of the Dark Magic gates. One just had some chests behind it with one recipe, but the second had a recipe and a Luminous Dark Tree which is very good for materials.

And I came across some upscaled versions of old MacOS wallpapers. And got a bit nostalgic.</p>\n<p>Definitely the last OS update I\'ve ever been genuinely excited for was Mavericks. That introduced native Dark Mode. There were a few helpful features after that, and the change to storage type was probably necessary, but that was really the perfect OS for me. It had everything I needed. I stopped updating my 2015 MacBook Pro at Mavericks because I really wasn\'t confident newer OS versions would be ok on the older hardware. It was already struggling with basic stuff. And I had a lot of software that had stopped supporting OS versions that old, but I didn\'t want to upgrade to newer versions because I would have to start paying a subscription fee instead of the one-time payment I had made however many years before.</p>\n<p>I definitely feel like moving to Windows 11 was a step backwards in a lot of ways. There are a lot of features and programs I just took for granted on MacOS that Windows still doesn\'t have. Even though I have stripped out all of the ad and AI bullshit and telemetry and shit, I do genuinely feel like Win11 is a worse OS than a version of MacOS from 10 years ago. It\'s just actively unpleasant to use.</p>\n<p>But I did spend a huge amount of time perfecting my Mac setup too. I told myself I\'d just have to spend that much time again getting Windows to work the way I want it to. But after a year of using it I still feel like Windows is constantly fighting me.</p>\n<p>The thing is, in my experience since switching off of MacOS and having to switch to mostly FOSS software for financial reasons the experience is still, generally, worse. I don\'t want to hear that I\'m just more familiar with MacOS and that\'s why I like it more. I started out on Win 95 and used Win XP up until university, I taught myself Command Prompt commands to deal with my shit-ass school-mandated Dell laptop and the million ways in which it would break. Then I switched to OSX for undergrad and it did, genuinely Just Work. I customized the hell out of it, but it wasn\'t because the built-in default software didn\'t work or because the settings were ass, it\'s because that\'s just the type of person I am.</p>\n<p>I used OSX/MacOS from 2007 to 2023. My first was a black plastic MacBook that just barely got me through my honours thesis – the hard drive was failing and the OS would get too corrupted and start repeatedly kernel panicking about once a month so I had my school files all backed up online and a full disk image on an external hard drive so whenever it failed I would reboot from the image, reinstall the OS, and then keep chugging away until it failed again. When I got to graduation I convinced my parents to buy me a new MacBook Pro for my masters. That lasted another four years before I bought a 2015 MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>I couldn\'t justify replacing it with another MacBook at the price they\'re at while I\'m unemployed. They\'ve always had a brand tax, but before I felt it was worth it. They had very good quality control and designs and you didn\'t have to compare a million different models at a million different prices. Now, the gap between them and the comparable budget to medium quality laptop is higher and the benefits seem less. MacOS has been iOS-ified and locked down. I learned how to program on MacOS and now they don\'t even want people to be able to install unsigned software.</p>\n<p>So I bought a Windows PC with the full intention of installing Linux. I did a lot of research and I tried dual booting PopOS, got it installed, and then somehow in the process of trying to figure out how to add GNOME extensions (the most unintuitive process I have ever seen) and get Bluetooth to work it crashed and it was unrecoverable even with Rescuezilla. I probably messed something up in my fiddling around with keyboard layouts trying to get it to use the Windows key in the same way Mac keyboards use the ⌘ key. Using CTRL+ as a modifier key is very un-ergonomic with small hands. I have to hold it with my left pinky finger.</p>\n<p>Anyway, had to wipe the whole thing. Didn\'t have the energy or motivation to try again at the time. Reinstalled Win11. I know that it might only take half an hour to an hour to get the actual OS installed, but the process after that of making it actually usable? Will my duplicati file backups even be read okay by a different file system? And then troubleshooting everything that breaks? Spending hours reading <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth_headset">that fucking Arch Linux wiki trying to diagnose what part of the 40000 ways Bluetooth can break</a> just so I can use my headphones?? (No disrespect to the Arch Linux wiki it\'s incredibly detailed.)  Yeah, I\'ll try again when I have the patience.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you hate Windows and you can\'t afford Mac you\'ve only got Linux, right? But the thing is. As I have experienced over the past year of having this laptop and trying to self host things on my NAS. FOSS often feels like a step down. Like, it\'s hard to find a piece of properly maintained open source software that is the same or better than comparative corporate / proprietary options in terms of functionality, reliability, and ease of use. They might be better in terms of security or privacy or ethics, and learning more about how computers actually work may be good for people overall, but you have to show people the real trade-off they\'re making.</p>\n<p>I genuinely think it\'s irresponsible to recommend Linux / de-googling / FOSS to normies as if it\'s going to be a 1-to-1 replacement and then throw up your hands when they complain and say it\'s just open source you can\'t expect too much. If you\'re prepared to actually provide hand-holding one-on-one tech support for someone as you transition them to another OS / software, which they have to use every day and rely on for life-critical things, then I salute you. Godspeed.</p>\n<p>So anyway. <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/default-mac-wallpapers-in-5k/">Here are the MacOS default wallpapers upscaled to high res</a> at 512pixels. I picked MacOS Monterey\'s dark mode for now, but downloaded a few. If I had found this earlier I maybe would have just colour sampled it and use it as my blog theme colours.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 5\xa0days, 6\xa0hours ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-16-fast-beginner-instant-pot-recipes" title="Fast Beginner Instant Pot Recipes">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-17-fantasy-life-i-150-hrs-update" title="Fantasy Life i - 150 hrs update">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Some nostalgia for old MacOS versions triggered by looking at default wallpapers and a short rant about FOSS.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-17-i-miss-osx/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Some nostalgia for old MacOS versions triggered by looking at default wallpapers and a short rant about FOSS.'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'journal', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'tech', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-17T16:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=17, tm_hour=16, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=4, tm_yday=290, tm_isdst=0)}

I buy and portion and freeze them so they\'re always ready. There are a lot of frozen veg that will cook for about the same amount of time as frozen chicken thighs so you can also just keep that in the freezer. <a href="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/instant-pot-chicken-thighs/">Here\'s the times I use for chicken.</a></p>\n<p>Stewing beef (off-cuts) is also good for the instant pot, but you need to brown it before cooking it to lock in the juices and be sure all the pieces are the same size so they cook evenly. Over-cooked beef really isn\'t great so you have to get the timing right.</p>\n<p>Calrose, arboro or other shortgrain rice can be cooked separately (6 mins high + 10 mins natural release) and put in the fridge and then cook the chicken thighs when you want them to put over top.</p>\n<p>Season before putting things into the pot.</p>\n<p>And my hot tip is you can fry bacon in the bottom of the pot and then take the bacon out. Anything you cook with the leftover bacon fat at the bottom of the pot will be extra tasty.</p>\n<p>My go-to recipes are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-07-15-chicken-rice-soup/">Chicken rice soup with veg</a> - very much dump it all in and go</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.happyfoodstube.com/instant-pot-chicken-risotto/">Chicken mushroom risotto</a> - requires a bit of sauteing to start but super warm and filling. I have bastardized this to remove the mushroom and onion and added in other veg.</li>\n<li>Chicken cacciotore (kind of) - chicken thighs in tomato puree. Generous italian seasoning (basil, oregano, black pepper, thyme, parsley) on the chicken thighs. Tomato puree in the pot with some water, whatever frozen veg you have (I usually do spinach cubes, but other firm veg like carrot or peas are usually also ok), bit of soy sauce and cooking wine, grate or chop some parmasean or grana padano in. Put the chicken thighs in on top, they don\'t need to be covered by the sauce. Same cooking time as linked above. Serve over rice.</li>\n<li><a href="https://funwithoutfodmaps.com/low-fodmap-beef-stew/">Beef stew</a> - great in cold weather but with the price of beef these days I don\'t do it much</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can see you can basically do chicken thighs + some sort of sauce or soup stock + rice + veg in any combination. Softer veg like raw tomatoes might go mushy or wilt but sometimes that\'s fine. All of these take 60 mins or less for me, but probably more like 90 when I was just learning and still modifying the recipe.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 5\xa0days, 16\xa0hours ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-13-fantasy-life-i-140-hrs-update" title="Fantasy Life i - 140 hrs update">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-17-i-miss-osx" title="I Miss OSX">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'Some short instant pot tips and a few starter recipes.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-16-fast-beginner-instant-pot-recipes/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'Some short instant pot tips and a few starter recipes.'}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'cooking', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'instant pot', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'recipes', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-16T18:50:15.851632+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=16, tm_hour=18, tm_min=50, tm_sec=15, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=289, tm_isdst=0)}

I\'m quite overlevelled of course. The story of the game overall was a bit underwhelming, but I liked the references to the original game and it wasn\'t bad per se. The best parts of the game are taken from the first game in general, but I can\'t deny it has kept my attention for this long.</p>\n<p>I don\'t know if I\'ll bother getting the two combat jobs that I haven\'t levelled at all up to Hero. It means a lot of grinding of mooks. I prefer just playing the jobs I can do on muscle memory. But now I have most of the Ginormosia areas up to rank 5 I have access to a lot more rare enemies and materials without having to go back down into the dungeons, which are so annoying to get in and out of. Today I finally saw a gold crown sheep enemy that drops a type of fleece that I need for my hero crafting.  So I\'m getting there. While I grind I\'m making an effort to get as many comrades up to full hearts as possible, it doesn\'t seem completely impossible.</p>\n<p>Based on what I read about the post-game content I\'m going to need to kill a lot of shadow enemies to get drops from them and there\'s two main ways to do that: the fortress or the treasure groves. The fortress means guaranteed spawns, the treasure grove means getting more other stuff at the same time. I have a necklace with item drop+ on it, but I need to try to make some more other stuff with that skill on it as well to make best use of my time. I might need some more of those remake cube currency things.</p>\n<p>I also know that I need to get the shadow energy balls dropping from shadow enemies to unlock the gates throughout the game. It\'s going to be annoying going back through every dungeon to find them all. I wish this game had a "repel spray" item or the dragon quest mechanic of weak enemies running away from you. Even if you can totally ignore them and they don\'t do any damage hitting you it\'s still annoying.</p>\n<p>I hadn\'t even touched the treasure groves before finishing the story, so I\'ve only made it down to floor 200 now (each floor goes by 10 so it\'s not as much as it sounds). I thought I probably would have to grind all the way down until I got to the level 50 layer to find anything good, but I\'ve already had ultra-rare materials spawn at level 20-30. Maybe it\'s because I\'m already level 70-ish in all my combat/gathering lives? But I\'m very happy to finally see some Magic Ore. I still haven\'t even seen any in Ginormosia.</p>\n<p>It\'s annoying that the Encyclopaedia in-game isn\'t super comprehensive. It mostly only shows you the first place you can find something. It still might be available elsewhere. And all the wikis/walkthroughs these days are bloated and ugly, even with quite strict ad-blocking you have to spend ages to find out one fact. The title of the page will be like "Location of Magic Ore" and then you have to scroll multiple times to find the single line of text that tells you where it is. The rest is just junk. And then you have to check somewhere else to confirm and they disagree. Argh.</p>\n<p>So when I play now my tasks are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy more shadow carrot seeds.</li>\n<li>Plant seeds and water.</li>\n<li>Go to Ginormosia and finish levelling areas to rank 5.</li>\n<li>Check for good legendary spawns and do those.</li>\n<li>Clear the first floor of the fortress for shadow enemies.</li>\n<li>Go back and check on the seeds to water them again.</li>\n<li>Do a treasure grove run.</li>\n<li>Turn in the shadow slate things for recipes.</li>\n<li>Restock veggies at stands and find merchants to spend acorns on rare materials and new recipes.</li>\n<li>Collect Celestia flowers.</li>\n<li>Check on the gallery (because it affects the island rank up).</li>\n<li>See what new things I can craft now that I have a few more new materials – I especially want to get at least one more legendary tool going.</li>\n<li>Talk to the Plundering Jaguar for upgrades to the legendary equipment.</li>\n<li>Craft some more food and potions.</li>\n<li>Harvest vegetables.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I guess I\'ll keep playing as long as I\'ve still got TV to watch while playing it.

It also generates a few more hex codes that are used within the Radix theme and extra colours for wide-gamut screens, but I stripped those out.</p>\n<p>Part of the appeal of using a semi-pre-made palette like this is that Radix has already done contrast checking and <a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/understanding-the-scale">tells you straight up what colours to use for what parts of the UI</a>. I didn\'t 100% adhere to it, but it was good for having a guide so I didn\'t spend all day trying every possible combination. So for e.g. violet-1 and 2 are for backgrounds and violet 11 and 12 are for text.</p>\n<p>I also didn\'t actually use the scale itself in the css, I copied and pasted the values into my own naming scheme, which I may end up regretting.

Most of the other css-only code snippets I found for the purposes of collapsing long text were more focused on full-on accordion menus or truncating long text into a modal window type thing. I don\'t want to have to make a whole elaborate thing that I\'ll have to copy and paste into a post every time I want to use it. So I thought for the purposes of posts like this where I\'m going to include a long block of text I\'m going to stick with <code>details</code> until it becomes a problem.</p>\n<p>The HTML looks like:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">details</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">summary</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Text that goes on the button<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">summary</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\nThe text you want to hide<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">details</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n<p>You can style it differently depending on if its open or closed and you can change the little arrow marker like it was a list marker.</p>\n<p>But then of course when I actually tried it to collapse a long piece of code the Markdown fenced code block doesn\'t render. So I tried to make the same kind of code block that markdown renders by hand in just html and now I don\'t have syntax highlighting any more. Because there aren\'t the bazillion little <code>span</code>s to target. 😩 So yeah I guess it\'s one or the other unless I figure out something else.</p>\n<h2 id="full-theme-code">Full Theme

I\'m not doing anything special for it, other than watch the Blue Jays. Canadian Thanksgiving doesn\'t have quite the same colonialist trappings as the US version, even when I was a kid it was just a harvest festival that had nothing to do with the subjugation of indigenous people. I don\'t know if they teach more indigeneity around the holiday in schools now. It was my favourite holiday as a teenager because unlike all the other official school holidays or my birthday it didn\'t have any negative memories associated with it and I got to eat good food made by my relatives. The fact that my parents can\'t cook beyond boiling things or heating things up in the microwave is well known in my extended family. Just being able to have homemade food, including apple pie for dessert, made the forced socializing worthwhile. Unfortunately I cannot see the point of cooking for one and apples now extremely reliably give me IBS cramps. 😭</p>\n<div class="toc">\n<h2 class="toc-head">Contents:</h2>\n<ol class="toc-list"><li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#reading">Reading</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#watching">Watching</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#listening">Listening</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#playing">Playing</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#living">Living</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/#bookmarking">Bookmarking</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><h3 id="emmurder-at-the-black-cat-cafeem-by-seishi-yokomizo"><em>Murder at the Black Cat Café</em> by Seishi Yokomizo</h3><p>I did finally read it the night before it was due back at the library. 😅 It was disappointingly short because even though it is a slim book to begin with it\'s actually two totally separate novellas rather than one, and the second one isn\'t listed anywhere on the front or back cover. It\'s a nice cover design, but confusing choice by the publisher. The second story is "Why the Well Wheel Creaked" and actually is much more emotionally moving and scary than the main one. But they both hinge on the mystery trope of a dual identity.</p>\n<p>There is something calming or satisfying about Yokomizo\'s stories, they\'re always perfectly complete puzzles. There might be lots of red herrings, false alibis, and multiple suspects, but at the end when you find out the solution from Kindaichi you don\'t feel tricked but rather that it was perfectly put together. The first story feels like it could have been drawn out to at least small novel length; if you read it right through as I did you won\'t have time to really try to come up with a solution by yourself unless you\'re very disciplined and stop midway on purpose. Unfortunately, one black cat does die. :(</p>\n<p>The second story is on a theme that Yokomizo has touched on before with Gokumon Island: soldiers returning changed from the war. The history of a rural noble family is told and their conflicts with other local families and you can see with the set-up what is probably going to happen, but the way the story unravels in epistolic form with a signature Yokomizo twist is still tragic and horrifying. No Kindaichi in this one either.</p>\n<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><h3 id="the-celebrity-traitors">The Celebrity Traitors</h3><p>As mentioned last week, <a href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-11-the-traitors-death-game-manga/">I did end up making a rec list of death game manga</a> that have a somewhat similar set-up to The Traitors or are focused on trust/lying and psychological manipulation.</p>\n<p>The first episode of Celeb Traitors was incredibly enjoyable and a fun variation on the original. It wouldn\'t replace the original because part of the appeal of the original is that it\'s just normal everyday people participating and these are all people who have public personas and know how to act for a camera. But Alan Carr turning into a puddle of anxiety is very, very funny to watch.</p>\n<p>Deeply irritated to find out that you can\'t access the tie-in podcast outside a UK IP address. let-me-in dot gif.

Baseball games are <em>so long</em>. The first game starts Sunday at 8pm. I always start watching a half hour or hour late so I can use the catch-up feature to skip the ads and boring bits, but I still haven\'t quite learned what parts of the game are safe to skip.</p>\n<p>Hackey has started. The Leafs will be playing the same afternoon as the Jays game at the ACC, so that area of the waterfront is going to be an absolute nightmare of people tomorrow. Not that I was planning on going down there.

Running out of room on the board to actually put the loose pieces.</p>\n<p>I haven\'t seen any new puzzles at the charity shop, alas. I might have to try the nearest Value Village, but they\'ll definitely be more expensive.</p>\n<h3 id="fantasy-life-i">Fantasy Life i</h3><p>Ran credits on Fri night after beating the final bosses handily.  I\'m quite over-levelled. Didn\'t cry, surprisingly, but it was a nice ending. I also did my first Treasure Grove to get a feel for it. I\'ve done some reading and it seems I will have to do some serious grinding if I want to get access to the recipes and materials needed to rank my crafters up to Hero. But what else am I going to do during these 4 hour long baseball games??</p>\n<h2 id="living">Living</h2><p>Despite feeling somewhat better mood-wise after last week, I\'m still having an absolutely awful time trying to sleep. I don\'t know if it\'s residual background stress or what. As a result I\'m also finding it hard to motivate myself to get things off the to do list because I\'m just tired and headachey all day. I haven\'t even really been working on CSS, although I still have a few things on my list to fix/change.

I had always assumed most of them were lying/faking their prosperity, but Ava goes into some of the specific tricks influencers use to make themselves look good in a way that is functionally impossible to replicate.</p>\n<p>I know people talk about the decline of literacy in the American (and Canadian) youth all the time, I don\'t really buy into it, but I especially think that they are probably much more video literate and savvy about this stuff than people like me. People have always lied on the internet, but people my age and older have also always been trained to see photo/video as the truest "proof" of authenticity there is. I wonder if there have been any studies on skepticism and literacy of video across age categories. But even if you\'re aware it\'s mostly a lie it still really fucks with your self-esteem to see it all the time.</p>\n<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20121218-00/?p=5803">Why was pinball removed from Windows Vista?</a> by Raymond Chen</p>\n<p>By the guy who actually did the code porting of 32 to 64 bit Windows.

However, some manga are entirely focused on the game, whereas in others the game is simply a single story arc or secondary to other genres. It could be defined as situations where a group of people are isolated and forced to play games with deadly consequences. Sometimes the consequences are financial, but usually with the implication that this person is going to be so financially ruined by losing that they might as well be dead.</p>\n<p>Most people know of it from Hunger Games, Squid Games, Danganronpa, or maybe the OG classic that popularized the style: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_%28novel%29">Battle Royale</a>. Japanese media didn\'t invent the "trap a bunch of people and make them play games to survive" idea, but in the 00s and 10s it seems to have captured the feeling of the time and they sure ran with it. It has since been superseded in popularity with edgy teens by isekai.</p>\n<p>These manga tend to be shelved as shounen (teen boys) or seinen (adult men) in the "Survival" category as well as "Psychological Horror" or "Thriller", but they vary in tone.</p>\n<h3 id="meta-analysis">Meta Analysis</h3><p>The trope is, in my opinion, mostly a representation of both the anxieties of teens, for whom every school day can feel like a life or death struggle, and the financial anxieties of adults in a punishing capitalist system with a firm social hierarchy. It particularly legitimizes the feelings of teenagers, who are experiencing the hightened emotions of puberty combined with being forced to attend school and obey adults even when they are being cruel or irrational. Navigating the social nuances of high school may not <em>literally</em> be life or death, but it sure feels like it. It provides a fantasy of being the one person capable of breaking the oppressive system, the person who is different from all the others, while also justifying violence as a necessary evil to survive the game. It\'s finally fine to kill that annoying co-worker and rebel against your boss and you will be hailed as a hero for doing it!</p>\n<p>It usually investigates themes of despair and hope, trust and friendship, meritocracy vs kleptocracy, survival of the fittest vs supporting the weak, and harsh truths vs the masks we wear every day. Most authors tend towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellum_omnium_contra_omnes">a Hobbsian view</a> where at the end of the day people will do anything to survive and the base nature of humanity is selfishness and competition. However there is often a "if we try really hard to trust each other we can overcome our base instincts and succeed" message i.e. build "civilization" as a bulwark against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature?useskin=vector#Thomas_Hobbes">"state of nature"</a> being forced on the players by the game. In many of the longer stories, the "players" uprising in revolution against the "game masters" is a key story arc, however it is usually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary">reactionary</a> revolution, attempting to return to an idealized prior existence.</p>\n<p>It is narratively a really convenient way to put a bunch of people who wouldn\'t normally interact into highly emotional over the top situations. Much like the traditional Agatha Christie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_circle_of_suspects">closed circle murder mystery</a>. It also allows the author to explore ideas of "human nature" while excusing quite a lot of extreme behaviour that would be outside the norm, both in terms of violence and sex. The structure of having games with rules and phases of play also provides a ready-made narrative structure and provides predictable story beats.</p>\n<h3 id="the-stereotypical-death-game">The Stereotypical Death Game</h3><p>Sometimes the games are gambling-related, sometimes they\'re logic puzzles, sometimes they\'re a forced dilemma, sometimes they are innocuous children\'s games – that was actually a super over-done trope well before Squid Games got there, which is why I was kind of baffled by it being heralded as innovative and genius by Western media reviewers. Death games can be more cerebral, and focused on logical thinking, psychology, deduction, and manipulation or more physical and focused on violence, combat, or survival in a harsh environment, but usually it\'s a mix of both.</p>\n<p>Protagonists are often quiet but smart "unassuming" male high schoolers or young adults, but they are sometimes adults. Female protagonists are pretty rare. There is usually quite a lot of gore and quite a lot of fanservice. Sometimes the protagonist is a Good Guy who wants to Win Through Friendship, but more often he is an anti-hero master manipulator logical thinker who has a heart of gold.</p>\n<p>The shorter manga usually have a smaller set of characters who are forced into playing one game together and thereby revealing lots of things about them and their backstory. The longer ones inevitably end up with many more characters both joining the protagonist\'s team and fighting against them. They also necessarily have many more games, which means they often over-stay their welcome as the author has to beat <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfEscalatingThreat">the Dragon Ball problem</a> of ever-increasing challenges for the protagonist to overcome while also justifying why the protagonist is even there at all. Which is hard when you\'ve already established a standard where losing is death and people desperately want out of the game.</p>\n<h2 id="wtf-is-the-traitors">WTF is The Traitors</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Traitors_%28British_TV_series%29">The Traitors</a> is a reality tv show originating with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Verraders">the Dutch</a>, but after it was franchised to the BBC in the UK hit worldwide popularity. It has finished its third series and has just started a first Celebrity Traitors series which will hopefully be very revealing. The host is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Winkleman">Claudia Winkleman</a> who acts as narrator and shepherds the contestants through their tasks.</p>\n<p>The premise of The Traitors is 22-ish normal people are taken to a castle in the Scottish Highlands. These are notably not influencers, B-list celebs, or reality tv regulars. Some of them will be secretly selected to be Traitors who can than "murder" other members. The non-traitors are called Faithful and they must choose to banish someone every day in the hopes of banishing a traitor and saving themselves. At the end of the game if one or more traitors are included in the final group of winners they will take the whole prize pot and the faithful get nothing. To add to the stress during the day the group go on "missions" that are usually elaborate team bonding exercises and they must work as a group regardless of suspicions in order to increase the prize pot.</p>\n<p>So it\'s basically a variation on mafia, wink murder, or werewolf game. You have to decide who you trust and then coordinate on who you will remove from the game without becoming suspected or targeted yourself.</p>\n<p>One of my first criticisms of the show when I started watching with Series 3 is that the missions were kids summer camp level difficulty. There was zero intellectual challenge and while there were more physically intensive missions there was never any risk of losing all the money or anyone being knocked out of the game. I thought they were basically impossible to fail – and then I watched series 2 where some of the missions were a bit more complicated and the teams very nearly failed almost all of them. (And I suspect in some cases the producers gave them a pass on some cheating or gave them some extra time to ensure they finished.) So I was under-whelmed by the actual level of jeopardy people were in, even if it was entirely fictional.</p>\n<p>This show is an excellent insight into how unrealistic most death game manga are -- it clearly demonstrates that 90% of people involved in a real death game would panic, rely on "gut instinct", and follow the herd. And the remaining 10% who come in familiar with logic puzzles and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame">wargames</a> tend to fail miserably at rallying the group around actual legitimate strategy and get voted out for being too smart and too calm. It\'s honestly an awful format for so many reasons, but certainly entertaining.</p>\n<h2 id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>For the purpose of this list I\'m mostly focused on the manga with a strong trust/lying element rather than the ones that are mostly about combat battle royales or which have a fantasy/sci-fi setting. As someone who has been around the genre for a while I feel these are all obvious and popular recs, so if you have already read all of these, sorry.</p>\n<p>The best death game manga still tend to be kind of… bad. This is popcorn reading. The art tends to be not very exciting and the stories tend to be formulaic. The protagonists even look pretty much interchangeable most of the time. It is extremely difficult to find one with an actually satisfying ending (don\'t even get me started on Gantz) so quitting partway through is valid. These are recommendations of ones that managed to hold my attention for one reason or another.</p>\n<p>There is almost always discussion or depiction of torture, violence, gruesome deaths, gore, animal cruelty, rape, sexual assault used for comedy, child abuse, slavery, suicide, abusive relationships, drug use, alcohol use, gambling, blackmail, participation in cults, etc etc.</p>\n<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2><h3 id="jinrou-game">Jinrou Game / 人狼ゲーム</h3><p>Kawakami Ryou & Koudon (2014, Takeshobo)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A manga cover of a young woman with light brown hair and glasses in a ripped sailor fuku covered in blood with her arms above her head as they transform into a bronze skulls.

When she wakes, she is trapped in an uncanny, isolated space with other  students from her high school and forced to take part in the “Werewolf  Game”. Thus, a death game filled with fear and terror that would pit  “Werewolves” and “Villagers” against each other, force them to murder begins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Short, 3 volumes, rare title with a female protagonist. Very gory, lots of T&amp;A. But very similar set-up to The Traitors. A bunch of teenagers are kidnapped and trapped together. There are two werewolves (jinrou) and the rest are villagers. The werewolves must kill someone every night, the villagers must vote for someone to be killed every day, and then kill them with their own hands. If they refuse to participate they are killed. Whichever side kills all of the others wins. However these people realize they are all actually connected somehow. And, rare in this space, the ending is pretty good. There are some sequels but I haven\'t read them.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 7/10</p>\n<h3 id="liar-game">Liar Game</h3><p>Kaitani Shinobu (2005, Shueisha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A brightly coloured image with three people layered on top of each other.

A young woman is in front with orange brown hair in a bob and blue eyes, looking sideways and wearing a pale blue top. The title is written in a rainbow gothic font with the Japanese pronounciation katakana underneath the Roman characters and the number 4. There are phrases in English like \' I will get\' along the image." src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/anarchaeopteryx/liar-game.webp" title="Liar Game manga volume 4 cover" />\n<figcaption><b>Image Source:</b> Shueisha</figcaption></figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The card reads as follows:\nCongratulations! You are one of the 1 in 100,000 people who has been entered in the amazing LIAR GAME TOURNAMENT!\nAlong with the postcard there is 100 million yen in notes. That\'s the beginning of the Liar Game. When the game ends, in 30 days, you will have to return your 100 million. If your opponent steals them, he can keep them as a prize, and you will have a debt of 100 million…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Long, 200 chapters. Unlike a lot of these, there is almost no physical violence. While the participants are manipulated into joining the game, they are also given multiple opportunities to back out. It is fundamentally a story about greed and trust, much like The Traitors. The protagonist is a young naïve woman who gets sucked in to the game by trusting the wrong person. She meets a professional con artist fresh out of jail who agrees to participate with her in exchange for half the winnings. She develops over the course of the manga into a more life-savvy character and he reveals deeper motives than just cash. The characters in this are fun and while the games are often based on logic puzzles they aren\'t just about finding a solution, they\'re usually also about persuading or manipulating the other players. It\'s honestly a good overview of a lot of ways in which people are conned or pressured into making bad decisions in real life. There is even a trans woman character that shows up partway through who, for once, isn\'t a caricature. The first volume is quite a good representation of how the rest goes, but if you think Nao is annoying she gets better I promise. The ending isn\'t great, the plot does peter out somewhat, but the games are well structured and it focuses on real-world psychology rather than going for shock value.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>\n<h3 id="tomodachi-game">Tomodachi Game / トモダチゲーム</h3><p>Yamaguchi Mikoto & Satou Yuki (2014, Kodansha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A young Japanese man wearing a black parka is reaching towards the camera with narrow brown eyes and shaggy black hair.

However, after the class\'s money is all collected, it is stolen! Suspicion falls on two of Yuichi\'s friends, Sawaragi Shiho and Shibe Makoto.\nSoon afterward, the five of them are kidnapped, and wake up in a strange room with a character from a short-lived anime. Apparently, one of them has entered them into a "friendship game" in order to take care of their massive debt. But who was it, and why did they have such a debt? Could they have stolen the money from class to pay for entry into the game? Katagiri and his best friends will have to succeed in psychological games that will test or destroy their faith in one another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Very Long, 249 chapters. One of the manga that is explicitly about friends betraying each other, with games designed to split people apart. If you like Death Note you\'ll like this, there is a lot of thinking by the genius anti-hero protagonist and then "Nani?!" reveals. If you actually want to try to solve puzzles or mysteries along with the players you probably won\'t enjoy this one as much. The art quality gets better as you go along, but the story gets repetitive and also the female characters\' breasts keep getting mysteriously bigger. There is some violence and involves more outdoors survival phases, but there is less outright shock gore.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 7/10</p>\n<h3 id="as-the-gods-will">As The Gods Will / 神さまの言うとおり</h3><p>Kaneshiro Muneyuki & Fujimura Akeji (2011, Kodansha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A very orange and yellow heavily sylized drawing with a young man reaching towards the camera with one hand and holding two cards in his left.

Yep, it was doing Squid Game 10 years before Squid Game, but with mostly high schoolers. As an interesting twist, the death games are something that is happening out in normal society, where everyone can see it, not in a locked dungeon somewhere. The protagonist is a "normal guy" who rises to the death game occasion, turns out to have a special ability, and builds a team to win. Decent character development. Has a very comedic/absurd style, but isn\'t scared of introducing characters and then immediately killing them off, which I always respect. Lots of girls with big boobs and typical shounen sex comedy. The ending isn\'t actually an ending, there is a direct sequel that leads to the actual conclusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 6/10</p>\n<h3 id="alice-in-borderland">Alice in Borderland / 今際の国のアリス</h3><p>Asou Haro (2010, Shogakugan)</p>\n<figure><img alt="A monochrome magenta stylized image of a naked woman who is seated with long hair covering her body and one eye is white.

Will Chota, Karube, and Ryouhei be able to survive this dangerous new world, and is there a way they can get back to their original lives?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Long, 18 volumes. Perhaps more well known because it was made into a Netflix drama. The protagonist is a typical teen guy, but unlike a lot of the other death game manga contains a lot of adult characters. The mix of ages is more like The Traitors, and the need for teamwork to get through the missions. While there is a fair bit of T&amp;A and some gags I think this is one of the better ones in terms of serious character writing. There are certainly more female characters that aren\'t just sex objects. The games also tend to have more depth and a trick to them. However it definitely went on too long and the ending was just never going to be satisfying.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>\n<h3 id="usogui">Usogui / 嘘喰い</h3><p>Sako Toshio (2006, Shueisha)</p>\n<figure><img alt="The POV is underneath an invisible platform that the character is standing on.

But to secure the integrity of these life-threatening gambles, a violent and powerful organization by the name of “Kakerou” referees these games as a neutral party. Follow Baku Madarame a.k.a. Usogui (The Lie Eater) as he gambles against maniacal opponents at games – such as Escape the Abandoned Building, Old Maid, and Hangman – to ultimately “out-gamble” and control the neutral organization of Kakerou itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saving the best for last. God, I wish it would get licensed and released in deluxe omnibus volumes. This manga is not really much like The Traitors, as most of the games in it are one on one or a small group against another small group, but it is very much about psychological manipulation. Also it is one of my all-time favourites so I have to give it a plug.</p>\n<p>However it is a very particular flavour that you will either love or hate. It combines the "punching people so hard they explode" of ultra-macho martial arts (<em>Fist of the North Star</em> is a strong inspiration) with extremely strong logic puzzles and plotting as the protagonist, Madarame Baku, bets his life on games.</p>\n<p>The characters are extremely memorable and the art is stylish, sometimes making characters look smooth and beautiful and sometimes making them look grotesque and terrifying. Most of these death game manga have a separate writer and artist because it\'s honestly very rare to find someone who can draw action scenes so effectively while also writing such a complex story. All the games are very "fair play", the reader is given all the clues necessary to determine the correct strategy or solution, and they are all extremely original. This very much isn\'t a character-driven story, but some of the character backstories can be surprisingly touching and emotional.</p>\n<p>Madarame Baku, the protagonist and titular "lie eater", isn\'t a self-insert character. Unlike a lot of death games, this isn\'t a story of a normal guy becoming a leader, or someone unfamiliar with a situation figuring out how to survive, this is the story of a world-class athlete going up against other seasoned winners, who are all complete maniacs, while the games are supervised by "referees" who provide the violence necessary to keep the games fair. The main appeal as a reader isn\'t just in watching Usogui win, it\'s in figuring out <em>how</em> he will win. What Usogui is actually up to, and why he is making these gambles, is slowly revealed and the story culminates after 540 chapters and 49 volumes in one final gamble that perfectly pulls all the storylines together. At no point does this manga slow down or get repetitive.</p>\n<p>There are some female referees, but there are very few female characters overall. Honestly, I think it\'s more honest not to have a token empty love interest character. However even though this manga doesn\'t go for cheap shock gore or lots of sexual content it feels like the horniest of the ones I\'ve listed here just because of how borderline erotic and intense the gambling and combat scenes are.</p>\n<p>The first chapter isn\'t a good introduction as it was originally written as a one-shot and some things were changed after the fact, but if you get through the first "Abandoned Building Game" storyline across the first two volumes it only gets better from there. <small>P.S. Marco is Best Boy and must be protected at all costs.</small></p>\n<p><strong>Personal Rating:</strong> 10/10</p>\n<hr />\n<div class="post-footer"><div class="reply"><b>⇄ Reply:</b> <a href="https://gamepad.club/@anarchaeopteryx">mastodon</a>+<a href="mailto:problematic.riddle.lizard@gmail.com">email</a></div>\n<div class="tip"><b>＄ Tip:</b> <a href="https://ko-fi.com/anarchaeopteryx">ko-fi</a>+<a href="https://liberapay.com/anarchaeopteryx/">liberapay</a></div>\n<div class="edit-date"><small>Post last edited: 1\xa0week, 2\xa0days ago</small></div>\n<div class="post-footer-nav"><div class="prev-post"><a class="previous-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-08-making-tea" title="Making Tea">Previous</a></div><div class="next-post"><a class="next-post" href="https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-12-oct-week-2-digest" title="Oct Week 2 Digest">Next</a></div></div></div>'}], 'summary': 'An overview of the death game trope, The Traitors tv show, and a rec list of manga with a similar premise.', 'links': [{'href': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-10-11-the-traitors-death-game-manga/', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/feed/', 'value': 'An overview of the death game trope, The Traitors tv show, and a rec list of manga with a similar premise.'}, 'tags': [{'term': '10', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': '2025', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'manga', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'reading', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'review', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'the traitors', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'tv', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'published': '2025-10-11T15:00:00+00:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2025, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=11, tm_hour=15, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=5, tm_yday=284, tm_isdst=0)}

It&#8217;s a place that feels alive and vibrant and peaceful &#8212; if only it wasn&#8217;t infested with elves. Ah well, not every zone can be perfect.</p>\n<p>This zone is notable for the fact that once you&#8217;re in the Golden Wood proper, there are no typical enemies &#8212; no orcs, goblins, and the like. Any real servants of the enemy. There are beasts to kill, of course, but even half of those are &#8220;protected&#8221; and shouldn&#8217;t be touched.</p>\n<p><a href="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/forest.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65109" height="394" src="https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/forest.jpg" width="700" /></a></p>\n<p>Because of the repeatable quests in this zone, it&#8217;s pretty easy to cheeseball the quest deed and not actually go through all of the stories. That&#8217;s my preferred method, because you can hoover up a chunk of dailies that have you go into a single orc camp area and do a bunch of stuff at once. Rinse and repeat that a few times, and the deed is done &#8212; and no flower picking, tree singing (seriously, it&#8217;s a thing with these elves), or sappy love story sagas have to be encountered.</p>\n<p>After that, it was on to the explorer deeds, starting with Lorien Look-out &#8212; a search of all the flets in the forest. Treasure caches aside, I love explorer deeds the most in this game. They&#8217;re relatively quick to do and usually lead you to interesting locations you might not find without prompting.

Huh, maybe I should replay the first one again.</li>\n<li><strong>Chained Echoes and Sea of Stars:</strong> These both are deliberate SNES-style throwback JRPGs with some great reviews that could hit the spot for a modern FF6 or Chrono Trigger.</li>\n<li><strong>Octopath Traveler 1 and 2:</strong> I really liked the first game but never did beat it or get into Act 2, and there&#8217;s always the second title out there as well. These being Square-Enix productions, they&#8217;d definitely hit that classic feel spot.</li>\n<li><strong>Clair Obscur Expedition 33:</strong> I don&#8217;t know too much about this title other than it&#8217;s a French-styled JRPG (is that a thing?) with glowing reviews and a creative fantasy world.</li>\n<li><strong>KOTOR 2:</strong> I never did beat this. And the last time I played it was back in 2017, so it might be time for a revisit.</li>\n<li><strong>Pillars of Eternity 2 and Avowed:</strong> I absolutely loved the first game yet kept bouncing off this sequel. I might need to push through to get into it past the opening act. If I beat that, I should probably line up Avowed to play, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3:\xa0</strong>Both of these are content-rich acclaimed titles with huge followings. I&#8217;ve only lightly dipped into both. Some day. Some day.</li>\n<li><strong>Rogue Trader:</strong> I was actually having a good time with this, despite the turn-based format. I should restart and give it another go.</li>\n<li><strong>Tyranny:</strong> I own this and only very lightly started it. It&#8217;s one of those titles often mentioned as underrated and overlooked, and that might warrant a more serious look.</li>\n<li><strong>Baldur&#8217;s Gate 2:</strong> I have the enhanced edition and haven&#8217;t played through this since, oh, 2005 or so. I have very fond memories of it, though.</li>\n<li><strong>Hogwarts Legacy:\xa0</strong>I own this but barely played it so far &#8212; my kids have 100% completed it though, they adore it.</li>\n<li><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2:</strong> Heard so many great things about this, I might snag it next time it goes on sale.</li>\n<li>Also&#8230; <strong>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</strong>?</li>\n</ol>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/2025/10/06/10-jrpgs-and-crpgs-im-lining-up-to-play/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/836ca23089c8b5bceed0338d9104bf161b5d9aa8a728d9318701ab6af13a8b9a?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=PG', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://biobreak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/chained-echoes.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Work? I don&#8217;t wanna get up. Mowing my yard? God, I just don&#8217;t <strong>want </strong>to do it. Making dinner? Man, that&#8217;s so much effort. But like, once I&#8217;m actually started, actually in it, I&#8217;m fine. I can work through the lack of motivation, plow through to the end of whatever task I&#8217;m on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take for example this past Saturday, driving up to my dad&#8217;s hometown to buy pizza for his (early) birthday dinner. It&#8217;s a two-plus hour drive, and I&#8217;d been conscripted into doing the drive up so that I&#8217;d know how to do it in the future, know how to get to his old stomping grounds, yadda, yadda. I wanted to go, but I wasn&#8217;t necessarily up for doing the driving. But once I was in the car, on the highway, I enjoyed it. I made the drive with little issue, got myself into the busiest part of town, and to the specific pizza shop he wants when we&#8217;re up there. My mom drove back partially because it was all she could do to <strong>not </strong>drive, and we would be going a way I had almost no experience with because of road construction. It was a nice trip back, saw a bunch of small towns I loved the look of, a bunch of sights I otherwise wouldn&#8217;t had I just stayed home and stared at my computer, you know, the usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or mowing my yard yesterday, I spent all morning dreading actually doing it, then once I was out there, I blew through a solid half of my part of the yard in one go. My brother relieved me to do his sections, then I tore through the rest with no issue after I tagged back in. I spent Saturday night in a state of &#8220;damnit, I don&#8217;t wanna do this&#8221; as I tried to sleep, but once I started, it wasn&#8217;t that bad. Both of it, and the painting we did this weekend, look pretty good if I say so myself. Front door looks nice, front room is done (save for one wall), the yard looks cleaned up for the year, it was worth the hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>But my biggest problem with anything I do, is just starting it. I have a ton of games that I want to play, pieces I want to write, maybe streaming again, but my biggest hurdle is making myself get started on any of those things. The Witcher 3 is high on my list of games to play, but I look at it on my Steam list, look at the install, remember the what felt like years to get let loose in the world, and my urge to play it dries up like the desert. To the point where I just load up one of the few games I do play, and do things that don&#8217;t involve any kind of massive time investment or mental bandwidth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, I talk a big game about how me and 16-year-old me would butt hears about getting started, but 34-year-old me is only better at getting in gear for the things he <strong>has</strong> to get up for. Work? Yeah, I got bills to pay, let&#8217;s get up and go. The things I actually <strong>want</strong> (or really should) do, like playing a game, or mowing my yard (or installing these windows&#8230;), &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna, I just want to zone out for a while&#8221;. And it infuriates me because I know that I&#8217;m just wasting daylight sitting and doing nothing, but nothing sounds like a good thing to do after doing something all day at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the toll that work is putting on me, but recently, the very idea of <strong>doing anything</strong> has made me miserable. Calls are up, clients are especially irritable, and the plates refuse to stop spinning for even one day. And by the time I&#8217;m settled in for the night, my mind is too torched to even consider starting up something else to balance and wedge into my day. Because the last thing I want to do is spend an hour watching a game before I can even move my guy around. If I wanted to do that, I&#8217;d just load up FFXIV and try to slog through the MSQ and Wuk Lamat&#8217;s overwhelming presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Like, right now the idea of writing doesn&#8217;t sound like climbing Everest ten times in a row, because I&#8217;m already in it. But when I build my spaceships in something like No Man&#8217;s Sky and think &#8220;man I want to write about how much fun I&#8217;m having building spaceships&#8221;, it feels like I&#8217;m climbing a mountain with no arms or legs. &#8220;I want to, but that sounds exhausting and I just wanna sleep&#8221; is usually the best excuse I give myself. And I hate it. I really do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how to fix this, other than follow my own dogma of &#8220;the only thing stopping you is you&#8221; when my brother gripes about not starting something himself. Maybe I should take my own advice and realize that the only thing stopping me from starting, is me. I installed X4 and Empyrion earlier today, and I want to at least try one of these games, like I had to make myself do with Space Engineers, whether I like any of them or not, and now I have no excuse as to why I haven&#8217;t. The games are there and ready to roll whenever, it&#8217;s on me to follow through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I start, I&#8217;ll be fine, I&#8217;ll enjoy whatever it is that I&#8217;m doing, that drive home wouldn&#8217;t have been nearly as interesting if we took the same route and had to fight traffic, but the prospect of doing something not even new, but starting something at exhausting to me. It shouldn&#8217;t be, but, it is. And until I can get myself past whatever hang up I have about doing the stuff on my lists of want-and-need-to-do-s, I&#8217;ll just sit in a numb haze repeating the same day five times in a row. I don&#8217;t want that, I want to actually try and start new things instead of being stuck on the few things I don&#8217;t have to think about to placate myself.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/10/06/10-6-2025-the-only-thing-stopping-you-is-you/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_2034.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_2034.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

What got on my mind was the even-further ingrained into my head idea that the more I slow down and not try to overdo things, the better my results are. Now, this is a battle I constantly have to have with myself, but, it&#8217;s one that I probably <strong>need</strong> to keep having. But, try explaining that to my subconscious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, a few weeks back now, I was cranking out the 110 ranks I needed to complete the Season/Expansion/wtf-ever Pass in Destiny 2. With the final ten ranks requiring five-times the experience per-level needed to get a level from 1-100, I was trying everything I could. I ground out missions, strikes, Solo Ops, anything that would knock out these Seasonal Challenges to get me further along the pass. I did so many that I ran out of Challenges to complete that didn&#8217;t involve getting a pick-up group to run Dungeons or Raids, which meant&#8230;Crucible. PvP, player versus player. The bane of my existence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a couple of Challenges I was zeroing in on, Scout Rifle and Solar kills particularly. So, I opted to do both at once, enter Polaris Lance, a Solar Scout that needs you hit your shots consistently to get use out of it. And do you, dear listener, know what I did? I hung back, I hit those shots, and I won more games than I lost in that run. I finished the Pass with two days to spare, got my cosmetics, and got the hell out of dodge. &#8220;Ash &amp; Iron&#8221; is trash, thus, I haven&#8217;t played since it dropped, and I haven&#8217;t bought the pass. But, passes kind of sort of don&#8217;t expire now, so my mad rush to finish them isn&#8217;t necessary any longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>But to go back to me in the Crucible, I played against every impulse I had to run ahead, to feed kills and Super energy to my opponents, and because of that, when my teams lost, it was close in every game but one. I hung back, I stayed glued to my teammates, I didn&#8217;t make any unreasonable, risky pushes to take Zones or chase down a kill. Which, is something I should be doing in general, with everything I do. Push when I know that I can get away with it, rather than push because it&#8217;s a day ending in -Y.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had games where <strong>I </strong>topped the scoreboard for my team, me, who can&#8217;t keep a K/D/R over 0.7 the majority of the time in whatever competitive game I play. I wasn&#8217;t trying to swipe kills from my team, I was hanging back to make sure I landed my shots, and didn&#8217;t feed the other team. Sure, I didn&#8217;t get the number of kills I&#8217;d have liked, but the assists still stacked up, I grabbed kills where I could, and wound up knocking out a couple more PvP challenges than I&#8217;d anticipated to, in far less time than I&#8217;d thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I would normally run in with an auto or SMG, instead, I was hanging back, making sure I stayed with at least one teammate instead of going solo, and using the cover in each area. If I saw an enemy, I didn&#8217;t immediately engage without an exit plan, I played like I was on a team, instead of being an island unto myself. Doing that let me win duels, being one bullet ahead instead of a bullet behind, it even let me come out of a couple 2v1 fights alive where normally I&#8217;d get swallowed whole. Even being down a player, and going 6v5 didn&#8217;t rattle me like I normally would get, because I stuck to the plan I made for myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>See, I typically get incredibly stressed out in PvP, which leads to me feeding the other team, and occupying a permanent place at the bottom of a leaderboard. I tense up when I encounter an enemy, get shaky, and nervous about every duel I wind up in. What I did was bite down on my tongue each time I started to get that nervous feeling and shaky when I got into a fight. It isn&#8217;t a &#8220;healthy&#8221; response, but, it did keep my mind from spiraling as I played each match. That, and putting something on to mindlessly listen to while I played didn&#8217;t hurt either, I could zone out and just focus on what was in front of me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that kept me from overthinking, over analyzing, just twisting myself into knots to the point where I couldn&#8217;t be effective. Which is what normally happens when I get myself stressed out, I become so shaky and nervous that I make every mistake in the book trying to hold together. When I&#8217;d died, between respawns I&#8217;d make myself take a deep breath, recenter myself, and try to get back to a teammate when I got back in. Doing that, I could get the jump on the enemy, instead of getting double-teamed myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing my rank go up in PvP, seeing my name not at the bottom of the board, it was pretty cool. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m going to do <strong>often</strong>, but to finish out a Pass, I&#8217;ll go slam my head on a wall for a bit. As long as I don&#8217;t play outright stupidly, I can hold serve long enough to get where I need to be, get my time in the mines over with as quickly as I can. As long as I can keep a hold of myself, not let myself get too overwhelmed by the task, I know I&#8217;m decent enough to not feel like I&#8217;m getting lapped by every player, just most of them.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/09/21/9-21-2025-play-smarter-not-harder/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_2033.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_2033.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I know it&#8217;s not &#8220;good&#8221;, but damnit I built this thing and I&#8217;ll make it good later!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahem. So, I&#8217;ve been playing a lot of No Man&#8217;s Sky since the Voyager update, where you can now build your own &#8220;Corvette&#8221; class ship to fly around in, and walk around in like it&#8217;s your own portable base. Last night, I finally worked up the money to buy all the parts I need to make me a Corvette, because I don&#8217;t know how the Expedition system works, and I&#8217;ve been too sick to give a damn about how to go about it and get a free Corvette (seriously, I feel like crap. Send help. Or more DayQuil and NyQuil.). Mine&#8230;is not great. It has the bare minimum of what you need to make it flight-worthy, and it shows. It&#8217;s a clunky, ugly mess that will get me from Points A to B, and not much else. But, it&#8217;s <strong>mine</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have hauled junked ships to Stations to scrap them, I have scrambled for my life from Sentinels as the game turns into Ace Combat 04 in space, all in the name of building my own ship. And I finally got it done around 11pm last night, flew it into a planet, and am seeing the good and the bad of it. The good, I have what amounts to a Pelican from Halo. The bad, the landing gear makes it ugly as sin, and I have this thing super vulnerable with the reactor being a massive target. It&#8217;s also very cramped inside, just enough room to jump out of the flight seat, and run around the hold while I&#8217;m on autopilot. When the Sentinels came on the planet I hit, I closed the hatch and looked out the cockpit. &#8220;At least I&#8217;m safe inside my mind&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like making something is a point of pride for me. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s in a game, or real life, that stuff is fulfilling to me. I still have two windows in my house to fix before winter, and if I ever get off my back to do it, I&#8217;ll be super satisfied with my work. Will it be &#8220;pretty&#8221;? No, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. It just has to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I can always reconfigure the Corvette later once I have access to better components. I just wanted to get one of my own built while the drive to play the game is still there. I have some things to trick it out with, but, not as many as I&#8217;d like, nor the experience with the system to really experiment with it. It makes me happy, and that&#8217;s really all I can ask for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ordered takeout tonight, and while it&#8217;s good, it just doesn&#8217;t have the same impact for me as the meals I cooked over the weekend did. My family still isn&#8217;t feeling great, and it was 4pm before the thought of making dinner finally sprang forty because work was busy. I don&#8217;t exactly feel proud of spending $30 on takeout, when if I <strong>really </strong>wanted to, I could have come up with something myself. It just &#8220;is&#8221; rather than is a dish that I can hang my hat on and say &#8220;yeah, <strong>I </strong>made that. I don&#8217;t care if you didn&#8217;t like it, I&#8217;m proud of myself for making it.&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>When I pick up the game again, I&#8217;ll still be going towards the center of the galaxy, but, I also want to keep amassing parts to make my ship my own. Sure, I have a Freighter, I have a (tiny) base, and I have my starting ship, but I want to make my stuff truly my own. Like with my little Corvette-class. It&#8217;s Spartan right now, but, I can make it fancy if I want to. I can make it to my very own liking if it so suits me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the point of it, though, that makes it &#8220;worth it&#8221; to me. That I took these disparate pieces and smashed something together that sure, someone else <strong>could </strong>have done for me, but, was more intrinsically valuable to me by doing it myself. I have projects in real life that yes, I need to hire someone to do, and that&#8217;s fine. But the ones that I can fix myself? Those are the ones that mean the most to me overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could have done the legwork to do the Expedition and get a &#8220;free&#8221; Corvette ship, but, that&#8217;s not as satisfying to me. When the handyman gets up here to fix a leaky toilet, it&#8217;s not necessarily the most satisfying fix, but, only because it&#8217;s a battle I don&#8217;t have the time or the know how to <strong>keep </strong>fixed. Fixing my windows? I can swing that. I don&#8217;t need specialized tools, I just have to do it. Same with building up Relics, or bases, or ships. I just have to do it.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/09/15/9-15-2025-it-sucks-but-its-mine/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/static-assets-upload9467594363923905941.png'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/static-assets-upload9467594363923905941.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

It isn&#8217;t, but, that feeling doesn&#8217;t ever go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I live (around Cincinnati), one of the local radio stations has a big fireworks show on the Ohio River on the night before Labor Day, that gets shown on one of the local tv stations each year on a rotating basis. It&#8217;s kind of a farewell to the season, a way to celebrate one last time before &#8220;real life&#8221; starts back up in earnest. And with it being literally at the end of August this year, the end of the Blaugust event, it has me wistful and wishing the summer never ended. Kind of like how I felt as a kid, when the fireworks felt like summer ended, even though I&#8217;d been back at a school for a week or two at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mowed my yard for what will probably be the last time this year, and while it was easier than it had been all season, it felt sad to do, because it&#8217;s the tail end of doing it until the spring. I can feel the days getting shorter, the weather has been cooler than before, and in my mind, it feels like time slipping away. It hasn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve been plenty busy this summer, I&#8217;ve done plenty of things, made changes I needed to make, it&#8217;s not like I haven&#8217;t done anything. But in my mind, I don&#8217;t want the season to end on me, I don&#8217;t want Blaugust to end, I don&#8217;t want the calendar to flip over tonight. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll say that I hate the summer, that winter is my favorite season, but I don&#8217;t <strong>really </strong>hate it. I don&#8217;t like the heat, I don&#8217;t like that my beleaguered baseball team is absolute dog water every year, the things I can&#8217;t control. I miss it when it&#8217;s gone, and don&#8217;t really appreciate it while it&#8217;s here like I should. Especially when it&#8217;s hitting zero on the thermometer, and I&#8217;m freezing to death even with the heaters roaring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer is freedom to me, even though I&#8217;ve been &#8220;free&#8221; for years now, with the exception of my job. It&#8217;s meant that I can spend that time doing what I want to do, going where I want to go, even though I can just <strong>do </strong>that whenever now. It&#8217;s meant that I don&#8217;t have to coop up in this house, that I can grab the car keys and go somewhere like I did yesterday. It&#8217;s probably a holdover from my childhood, but, what isn&#8217;t at this point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230;I should really just use my PTO and realize that there&#8217;s three other seasons, and that just because it&#8217;s colder/freezing/not as warm, that I can just go do things without waiting for the calendar to say June/July/August. Just because summer is ending, it doesn&#8217;t mean that I can&#8217;t just take some time and go do something that interests me. It isn&#8217;t like I can&#8217;t just jump into the car at 5pm on a cold January evening and drive around for an hour because it &#8220;isn&#8217;t the right months&#8221;. Or take a trip to the city and go shopping for something I&#8217;ve wanted and don&#8217;t want to order online. I don&#8217;t <strong>have </strong>to be responsible <strong>all the time</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Because in my mind, those other seasons? Those are when I have to be &#8220;responsible&#8221;, have to be buttoned up and an adult, while in the summer, I can screw around and get weird with it. Which hasn&#8217;t been the case for a long time, since my &#8220;responsible&#8221; time is &#8220;between the hours of 7am-4pm, Monday-Friday&#8221;, and all through the year. After that, I can be a screwball weirdo all I want, as long as I&#8217;m not hurting anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with Blaugust, it feels like it&#8217;s my chance to get really experimental with how I write, even though there&#8217;s no rule book <strong>to</strong> writing like this. I can get weird all year! Why am I stocking up my stream-of-consciousness yapping to burn on one month, instead of just doing weird shit whenever I want? It&#8217;s not like the Blog Gods are going to come down and smite me for writing about baseball in January!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That freedom to go off the map is there all year, and I need to learn how to just run with it. That &#8220;summer vacation&#8221; for me is just a state of mind, not a reality I have to live with any longer. That fireworks show tonight will be the &#8220;unofficial&#8221; end of summer, but that summer doesn&#8217;t have to end for me. I can make it last forever in my mind if I want to, I don&#8217;t have to let that freedom go just because the calendar and the leaves change.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/31/blaugust2025-day-31-end-of-the-line/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_1751-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_1751-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Not because I don&#8217;t care about my Buckeyes, but, because I knew that I could not handle the stress of it. I know how I am, and you could door me up on happy pills until the cows came home, they would not touch that kind of anxiety that comes from this team that I put way too much of my mental health into every autumn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We won, by the way. 14-7 against the preseason number one, made Arch Manning look lost, made <strong>two </strong>goal-line stands, and at least for one week, I stave off that stress-induced heart attack that <strong>will </strong>kill me one of these days. New starting Quarterback Julian Sayin did what he needed to, didn&#8217;t blow it, and the defense looked like a pack of killers from what I&#8217;ve gleaned post-game. Are we good enough to repeat as National Champions? Probably not, but I feel very lucky that I&#8217;ve gotten to see three Natties in my lifetime, and I&#8217;m still in that post-championship glow period. As long as we beat Michigan this year, I&#8217;ll take not winning a championship. I&#8217;ll take the gold pants over a gold trophy if I have to choose between the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those not drowned in why I&#8217;ve seen be described as &#8220;midwestern Doom Opera&#8221;, Ohio State&#8217;s biggest rival is Michigan. Every year, they play in what is known simply as &#8220;The Game&#8221;. No trophy, no cute rivalry name, no. It is &#8220;The Game&#8221;, and Ohio State has lost the last four games in the series, after winning seven of them in a row. That game, plays havoc so badly on my nerves that I will do nearly <strong>anything </strong>to <strong>not</strong> watch it. I will clean my house, I will work overtime at my job, I will go drive to god-knows-where to get something, or just go where there is no cell service so that I won&#8217;t be able to check the score. Those aren&#8217;t examples I&#8217;ve pulled from thin air, either. I&#8217;ve done <strong>all </strong>of those things in the past to not watch The Game. This game against Texas? I was hitting that level of stress a month ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;d I do to mitigate it? I ran errands, I went and did things, I did as much as I possibly could to push this game out of my mind as long as I could stand it. I took my mom for coffee, I went to Lowe&#8217;s and bought paint, I went to the Amish bakery, I bought mums to plant, I drove to Walmart and hemmed and hawed about what pens I wanted to buy, I drove to another county blasting my music just because I could. I did all these things, and still the need to check that score crept in. So, when I got to a place to pull off, I did just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth quarter, 3:28 to go, and Texas just scored. Shit, here it comes. My anxiety goes from a 3 on the scale of 1-10, to a 12. I throw on more music, I throw on a podcast, even my beloved Hangman Page&#8217;s theme, &#8220;Ghost Town Triumph&#8221; can&#8217;t dull the nerves for me. When I finally muster the nerve to check in again, I see it. &#8220;Ohio State 14, Texas 7, End of Game&#8221;. Oh my god. Oh my god! They&#8217;ve done it! I&#8217;m over the moon, all my stress fades away in an instant. I&#8217;m now 30 miles from home and at a stop sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My drive home wasn&#8217;t nearly as nerve-wracking as my drive to where I wound up. Sure, it&#8217;s a holiday weekend, and there are cops crawling the highway, whatever, I&#8217;m driving exactly the speed limit. I turn off to a backroad that will get me most of the way to where I want to get off of the highway at to go home. I know this song and dance, I used this road many a time to dodge cops setting speed traps in those four years I spent driving this highway every day. I know where they camp at, I know <strong>when </strong>they camp. Me turning off and driving a lesser-used road that gets me to the same place a little slower than the highway is no big deal to me. Maybe the happy pill <strong>is </strong>working, because the two cops I saw in that town would have scared the life out of me a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>But, all that is a way for me to kind of realize that I don&#8217;t <strong>have </strong>to set myself into a pressure cooker every time there&#8217;s something that will stress me out. I get stressed over high-stakes football games, okay, I don&#8217;t <strong>have</strong> to watch them? I can watch them after the fact, or just skip it altogether if it&#8217;s a result I don&#8217;t like. If that tOSU/UTexas game comes on as a rerun sometime, hell <strong>yes</strong> I&#8217;ll watch it. Ohio State/Michigan from 2021-whenever we finally can beat them again? Nah. I can skip it. My coworker hasn&#8217;t given me <strong>too much </strong>crap about it the past few years, and my new boss is a Texas fan, so, I probably shouldn&#8217;t needle him about this game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same with seeing those cops while I was driving. I think I can trust myself more than I used to, know that as long as I&#8217;m not doing anything wrong, they have no reason to pull me over. I&#8217;m driving the speed limit, I&#8217;m not driving erratically, I&#8217;m not on my phone, I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;m supposed to, I shouldn&#8217;t need to panic. Maybe it&#8217;s the happy pills talking, but I drove past a speed check on my journey, and didn&#8217;t lose my mind immediately when I saw the cop. Okay, speed limit&#8217;s 45 and I&#8217;m going 44, we&#8217;re good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When that last Saturday of November comes up, I&#8217;ll probably do the same thing. Ideally, I won&#8217;t have to take a cat to the Vet that day, like in 2022, but, I can find things to occupy my mind the majority of it. I can make a long drive to somewhere if it means I don&#8217;t turn into a puddle of nerves at the sight of the colors Maize and Blue. I can throw my music on, listen to my podcasts, find diversions to take the stress and anxiety of this thing I can&#8217;t control off of me for long enough for it to go down, the dust to settle, and me to calm my nerves. I could drive someplace I&#8217;ve never been if the idea strikes me in that moment. It&#8217;d probably be more fun than staring at a tv for four hours in a full-blown panic attack.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/30/blaugust2025-day-30-dont-think-about-it/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_2012.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_2012.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I went to pay the mortgage and get pizza after work, sue me (don&#8217;t actually). It came to my mind when I went to pick up the pizza, and the guy who runs the place spoke to me, asked me how my dad was. I did all the usual pleasantries, &#8220;old and sleepy, haha&#8221; , but that isn&#8217;t my point. My point is that, man, 16-year-old me would <strong>hate </strong>34-year-old me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, in a long-since former life, I, my dad, and to an extent my mom, all worked for the guy who supplied their arcade machines in the pizza place&#8217;s &#8220;game room&#8221;. That&#8217;s how he knows us, because he&#8217;d see us at least once a week to collect the machines and give him his cut of the money they made. Sometimes it&#8217;d be a ton, sometimes it&#8217;d be barely $50 total for the whole room, but, we didn&#8217;t screw him on his money, like our boss would. And with this being Labor Day Weekend, they&#8217;re going to be hopping all weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that got me and my mom to talking about how we&#8217;d have taken care of his business had we actually been the ones making decisions back then. That pizza place, and a couple other locations that would have been our &#8220;Crown Jewels&#8221;, AKA, &#8220;the ones who get the absolute <strong>best </strong>machines, most detailed support, consistently checking in to make sure we <strong>keep</strong> them as a client&#8221;. Then it hit me, that the younger me, who had to be given the &#8220;if you aren&#8217;t going to work, you aren&#8217;t going to get paid, now let&#8217;s just go&#8221; from my dad back then, he would never have been like that. He&#8217;d have done&#8230;about the same as that old boss, only without snorting all the profits to support a pain pill habit. How that man even made it to 60-ish I will <strong>never</strong> know.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now, mid-30s me is kind of a workaholic, hell, I&#8217;m picking up a holiday shift and Saturday next week at work because I have nothing else going on. Teenage me most certainly was not like that. We only got paid a little bit more than gas money back then, so, that carrot on the stick was pretty small, and Final Fantasy XI was well into its heyday as well, so, I wanted to spend <strong>every</strong> waking moment in front of the Xbox 360 playing it. I didn&#8217;t want to work, or do chores, or run errands, or do yard work, no. I wanted to sit and play this game until my eyes bled, and then play some more. That isn&#8217;t a good way to start a career, even if it&#8217;s under-the-table because I was in high school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until mid-college that I actually started getting myself in gear to do class work, actually <strong>go </strong>to work and class, not be a lazy piece of crap at my best. Sure, my grades in high school were great, but I didn&#8217;t have to try. College, and the actual working world where I didn&#8217;t get to set my hours, that made me have to knuckle down, and drag myself across the line to get things done when I didn&#8217;t want to. That, eventually became just doing it when it came up instead of just putting in the bare minimum of effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, thinking about going to collect the machines from that pizza place, or the resort we had machines at, especially on a holiday weekend? 34-year-old me would have been hounding 16-year-old me as hard as my dad did back then. That&#8217;s the biggest clients we have, you can play games <strong>later</strong>, we take care of these guys, end of story. Grab your wallet, your shoes and let&#8217;s get going.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Me now would have had a gameplan for what clients we collect each day, what vending machines we did restocks on, and wedge in slack time to go do repairs for clients that needed an arcade cabinet fixed. We&#8217;d be cross-referencing clients&#8217; operating days and hours, and determine our route for the day based on that information. Go service locations A/B/C/D on Monday, D/E/F on Tuesday, G/H/I and penciling in replacing a coin chute on a location at C on Wednesday, and so on. My younger self would have thrown a fit at me, but, running a successful, sustainable business means you have to get up and do the work. I know how I was, a moody, snippy little prick, and me now has no time or patience for that nonsense. Me now has a schedule, a routine, and a laundry list of things that need done each day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That pizza shop? We&#8217;ve known the owners for 20+ years, I went to school with their daughter/granddaughter (the other owner is that guy&#8217;s father-in-law). We moved a pizza oven into a location they were setting up pro-bono (and I witnessed them arguing about the logistics of it in Spanish saying a lot of words my teacher at the time wouldn&#8217;t teach us), even now, years after that old boss and that shop broke things off, he asks how my dad is. Like, if he needed us for anything, we&#8217;d probably help out no questions asked. That isn&#8217;t something you develop without actually caring for the client, without actually getting up and going when they call with a problem. That&#8217;s where past and present me would have our biggest clash of heads. He both didn&#8217;t, nor did he want to try. I don&#8217;t necessarily <strong>want </strong>to have to try, but, it&#8217;s gotta be done, and no one else is coming, it <strong>has </strong>to be me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have to work tomorrow, but, I&#8217;ve got things to keep me busy. I&#8217;m on the hook for going to buy mums tomorrow, which will distract me during the Ohio State/Texas game, it&#8217;s work, but it&#8217;s things that probably need to be handled now, when I have a minute, rather than later, when I don&#8217;t. That six-day week is going to crunch me for time next Saturday, so, I have plans for this one. We need paint for the living room, we&#8217;re going to get mums, and I have a yard to mow Sunday. My younger self would be dragging ass to get one of those things done, and while current me will be, it&#8217;ll be because he&#8217;s trying to get them all taken care of, instead of wanting to go inside and play games all day.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/29/blaugust2025-day-29-not-pleased-to-meet-me/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1996.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1996.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

So, I&#8217;m going to sit here, play my silly little games, watch my silly little cartoons, and try not to think too hard before work tomorrow. I also forgot to take my happy pill this morning, so, the comedown from that has me a little erratic right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like, I think I need a day occasionally where I don&#8217;t take my medicine, just to let myself feel all those emotions that the medicine represses, or I just repress because I&#8217;m a bundle of neuroses and unresolved traumatic incidents. Then the next day, I take my happy pill, and get right back into the saddle. It&#8217;s a nice balance, I think. A day where I throw double birds at my laptop screen all day and want to both cry and rip my own head off is a counterweight to not feeling much aside from &#8220;chill&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ripping off my own head was because of a case I &#8220;helped&#8221; on today, where the lowest priority support had an issue that I sniffed out in a few seconds. Then I became a teacher for five minutes trying to get this proverbial horse to drink after dragging it to the water. They&#8230;aren&#8217;t getting much better than this, are they? When even my Tier 3s are saying they have zero faith in this hiring class, it&#8217;s not been a fun time. God bless the three competent people down there playing Sisyphus&#8217; greatest hits every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I seem to be sitting in the dark writing instead of turning on my lamp for the evening. The goal is to make some headway in Xenoverse 2 tonight, maybe throw in some No Man&#8217;s Sky with its new update if I get time to. Very glad that tomorrow is Friday, because the two days I have off will be it before I go into a six-day week next week, with 16 hours of overtime. Gotta love holiday pay.

Nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Okay, so, what did you do while you had him on the phone?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nothing, I&#8217;ve never seen it before so I don&#8217;t know how to fix it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You gotta be kidding me. Instead of remoting in, documenting the issue, you tell them I&#8217;ll call them back once I clock back in, and do nothing with it? Oh, they got their call, straight to their Voicemail.

I&#8217;m off the clock, someone else can deal with it, it isn&#8217;t like I don&#8217;t take calls for their cases while they&#8217;re away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like, it&#8217;s frustrating to see. I get irritated when I get calls from other departments where the transfer notes are just my department&#8217;s three-letter designation in our call software. But, I&#8217;ve battled many times with many people over crappy documentation, I&#8217;m used to it. When someone on my own team gets a call and gives us nothing to work with? I was halfway towards flying off the handle, happy pills or no.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>There are some days where I really wonder <strong>why </strong>my job keeps me around, but, there are <strong>also </strong>days like today, where it becomes readily apparent that I am in fact, far better than I give myself credit for. I&#8217;ve repeated it a million times by now, but my notes are thorough, my documentation is there, if I see a problem, and I can work it, I will show what I did. I will explain why I did it, and give a rundown of the case for the next person to see the case. If I send something to another department, I will tell you <strong>exactly </strong>why I sent it, what my reason is, and what I want you to do. If I close a case, or dispatch it out, you will know my reasoning for what I&#8217;d done, because you can&#8217;t read my mind, and I can&#8217;t read yours either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see my own people doing the same shit I light into other departments for? I see red. What do you mean you didn&#8217;t put any notes into the case, even just to say you took a call on it and reporting what the client says!? Or when a case calls in, I get the call and the only update is someone telling the client to call us? What the hell kind of Customer Service is that!?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have gone to my boss, and every boss I have had in nine years on this subject, and the post-Covid, &#8220;everyone is permanently work-from-home&#8221; years has only made it worse. Those of us who are working towards moving up, you can tell what our work looks like, detailed notes, documentation of what was done, what our next steps should be. My cracking jokes about having nightmares that I&#8217;m late for work and crashing my car in a parking garage are not indicative of the quality of my work when it&#8217;s time <strong>to </strong>work. No, when it&#8217;s time to go, we go. I know my stuff, and I prove it with my case updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I know, not everyone works like me, but that isn&#8217;t even my point! My point is that we owe it to the client to give them our best shot whenever they call in, or get them to who can. When my own people won&#8217;t even remote in and do the bare minimum of troubleshooting on an issue, it <strong>really </strong>burns me up. Because then it seems like we aren&#8217;t even trying. Which makes us as a team, as a company, look bad to those clients paying us a <strong>lot </strong>of money for our products and support for those products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took a call on this person&#8217;s case the day before, and resolved the issue in a few minutes. When I did, I noted down what I did, documented the steps I took to resolve the issue, and reiterated that in my closing notes. Not because I was trying to style on them, but because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m <strong>supposed</strong> to do, and also to give them notes on how to fix that issue the next time they see it. Because that&#8217;s how I have my little note repository, I take those fixes, write them out, and save them! My notes go back nine years, and I&#8217;m <strong>still</strong> sorting through them to through into my OneNote book for work!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not asking for the world, I&#8217;m asking for basic competence from the people on my team. Some of us are more than pulling our weight, doing all those things that are expected to adequately take care of a client, while others are doing the bare minimum and only succeeding at frustrating us, and the customer. You take a call, work it as best you can, and note what you did! That&#8217;s all I ask! It should not be this much of an issue!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/27/blaugust2025-day-27-show-your-work/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/img_1809.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/img_1809.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

And surprisingly, it&#8217;s one I should have seen a million miles away, and he <strong>yammed </strong>it home with the concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, out of all the characters I&#8217;ve created for my little car-crash setting of the &#8220;Alterverse&#8221;, my personal little fanfiction-adjacent playground for ideas, Eoghanan is my personal favorite. He&#8217;s the ideal me in my mind, was a legitimate baseball prospect at Shortstop in high school, became an adventurer and knight, married his high school sweetheart, works as a teacher because he wants to help raise up the next generations, he&#8217;s everything I wanted to be growing up. He&#8217;s gone through a lot in his life, lost friends to violence, been taken captive, nearly lost the love of his life, but has pulled through to survive and help others. But what happens when you rip it all away? What happens when all those things that ground him, all those people who mold him into who he is, what happens when you tear them all away? That&#8217;s a question my brother asked, and hit a home run (to push the baseball metaphor harder) with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He asked the question, &#8220;what if Eoghanan was raised into Undeath as a Death Knight?&#8221;, which lead to a perfect title for him, &#8220;The Death Rider&#8221;. He came up with it because I told him once that the current starting point for nearly 40-year-old Eoghanan is &#8220;what if Jon Moxley (pro wrestler) had a sword?&#8221;. The dry humor, the beginning of gravel to his voice, kind of adopting &#8220;Wild Thing&#8221; as a personal anthem, the springboard I use for him is just Mox. Not leader of &#8220;The Death Riders&#8221; Mox, but closer to Blackpool Combat Club, loose-cannon badass Mox. As he put in his autobiography, sort of a John McClane from Die Hard type.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>He set the table for that incarnation based on the Fractures In Time from World of Warcraft, where versions of characters from other timelines intersect with the main one. He started with the idea of Highlord Marnes, or &#8220;Deathlord Frostbane had he never been killed at Lordaeron&#8221;, and branched from there. He got to The Death Rider, and my mind went off. I started getting ideas of how we got here, what caused him to become a Death Knight, and what that timeline looks like because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So picture this, Legion, The Burning Shores. Designate Killjoy is called back in to counter the Burning Legion&#8217;s incursion on Azeroth. Our intrepid strike team ports in from Vana&#8217;Diel, not knowing The Horrors would await them. It doesn&#8217;t go well. Like in the main line, Highlord Tirion Fordring, King Varian, and Warchief Vol&#8217;Jin all fall on the shore. But it doesn&#8217;t end there. One by one, Killjoy is cut down by the Legion. Merrex, Rayder, Kate, Firewalker, Scarlet, Lance, and even Vera fall. Eoghanan is all that&#8217;s left. Blood pouring from his body, Scythe and Greatsword in hand, he steadies for his last hurrah, his last stand in a losing battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Army Of Light takes the Shore, the combined might of the various factions of Azeroth, and the full weight of the Galactic Federation behind them are just <strong>barely </strong>enough to win the day. But the cost is high. Deaths are in the thousands, Killjoy isn&#8217;t special in this case, squad after squad is wiped out entirely, as the Deathlord walks through the now quiet battlefield to try and begin to tally the dead, a hand clings to his boot. A voice weakly calling to him amidst the carnage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Deathlord! I-I know you can hear me! They&#8217;re dead! All of them!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Malone?&#8221; He crouches down to comfort the shellshocked knight. &#8220;How badly are you injured? Speak to me, stay with me boy!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to make it. I can&#8217;t move, I can&#8217;t feel my legs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pall washes over his face, he knows that this is the end of the line. A quiet look of acceptance and resignation as he accepts his death, and maybe, just maybe getting to see Vera again. As he closes his eyes and tries to drift off, all he can see is the image of the Burning Legion ending her life, again, and again. He seems them cutting down his friends, all with the same deranged look of glee and satisfaction, not even in the name of Sargeras. His eyes open, acceptance and resignation turned into anger and a need for vengeance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Marnes. I&#8217;m not going to make it. Will you&#8230;will you raise me as a Death Knight?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Samuel, you know not what you ask for, you know that your soul will not rest, even should we defeat the Legion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t care. She&#8217;s gone, Deathlord. They killed her. They killed all of them. I&#8217;m not going to make it off this beach either&#8230;I&#8217;m bleeding out, I can&#8217;t move. So please, let me be of some use.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Deathlord raises one of his Blades of the Fallen Prince, &#8220;&#8230;it shall be done.&#8221; The blade pierces Eoghanan&#8217;s heart, ending his suffering, as a blue swirl of energy emanates from his body and the sword.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a (very) rough setup for how he gets from Point A to Point B, but the general bones are there. Legion, but Everything Goes Badly. Once he&#8217;s raised into Undeath by Bolvar Fordragon, he becomes the Deathlord&#8217;s right hand, carrying a Rune Forged incarnation of Balmung into battle, leaning into the Blood discipline. From there, he scours the Broken Isles, becoming a one-man army of vengeance toward the Legion. Gone are the jokes, gone is the light-hearted nature, gone is the need to hold back on those who wronged him. He becomes a terror in his own right, carving bloody swathes through the demonic hordes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he crosses over to the main universe in Fractures, his counterparts are horrified at what he&#8217;s become. Meeting himself, main Eoghanan sees what he could have become had he lost those closest to him. Highlord Marnes is shocked at the level of violence that The Death Rider is willing to go to in order to battle back the Void. In his universe, the Legion took an immeasurable toll on all those who walked out the other side. Azeroth, and countless other planets bearing the scars of their war. Even main Frostbane is saddened that someone he&#8217;s seen grow as a soldier and as a man, would willingly set himself down this awful path in order to avenge those he&#8217;s lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t a final draft of that concept that my brother came up with. Not even close, but, it is something that I can mentally chew on, an idea that I can just go a little nuts with, because it doesn&#8217;t tie into my internal, overarching narrative. It doesn&#8217;t conflict with anything I consider &#8220;canon&#8221;, and can use it as a way to explore different themes and motivations for characters I thought I&#8217;d known for as long as I&#8217;ve been doing this. It&#8217;s a fun little narrative experiment that I can go on, and for once, I kind of have to hand it to my brother for jumping on a really fun concept.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/26/blaugust2025-day-26-lets-get-edgy/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_1520-1.png'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_1520-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I&#8217;m not great at it, seeing as I&#8217;m the slowest person in the room in terms of pure reaction speed, but, I&#8217;m kind of holding my own. I did manage to take the first actual boss down along with me in one run last night, so, technically I&#8217;ve beaten the first area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an Early Access game that just hit its EA release in the past week (as of time of writing), so, it&#8217;s missing a lot of things. Weapons, levels, parts of its story, but having followed Ultrakill&#8217;s development like I have, it isn&#8217;t a huge deal. I can play what&#8217;s there, the rest when it&#8217;s added, and a full run once it&#8217;s all out. The way it plays reminds me of Ultrakill as well, with having to play aggressively to keep topped up on health, a grapple that you use to throw objects at targets, and me having to tap dance on my mouse and keyboard to keep up. I like it, even if it is physically demanding for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5197" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1984.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, I only have two weapons, the pistol and assault rifle, but you can only take one with you on a run. To compensate for your lack of firearms, you get a sword, grenades that recharge after a few seconds, and the ability to gain abilities to shoot at enemies. While you&#8217;re on a run, you&#8217;ll gain upgrades to attach to yourself and your weapons, that you&#8217;ll keep for the duration of said run. What I found worked really well for me was using a chain-lightning ability, increased grenade range and damage, along with stacking 60+ percent recoil reduction on my rifle as I technically cleared the first area, albeit dying right as I killed the boss.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5201" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1981.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;s the game about so far? You are Subject 1473, thrown onto a train and dumped off in an apartment-looking holding cell. Before you drop into your first run, you drop down to a secret area under your room, where the previous Subject 1473 brings you up to speed on why you&#8217;re here. He&#8217;s dead. He&#8217;s a disembodied voice telling you plug a chip into your head from a skeleton. It&#8217;s fine, don&#8217;t worry about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5198" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1980.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You are&#8230;somewhere. Somewhere under the watchful eye of IDRIS, an AI overlord obsessed with &#8220;testing&#8221; his subjects. Sounds like GLaDOS, except IDRIS &#8220;tests&#8221; by making them fight through waves upon waves of machines. You aren&#8217;t the first, nor are you the last. The previous 1473 says you <strong>can</strong> escape, but only by fighting your way to freedom. May as well get started, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5199" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1979.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally you&#8217;ll be shifted from the area you&#8217;re in, to what seems like an office complex, for a &#8220;Voidaxis Industries&#8221;, seems kind of specific, almost like they had a hand in&#8230;whatever this is. Logs will occasionally be found that talk about the beginning of whatever crisis this is, or notes from other, less fortunate test subjects. I found one who told that she was going to hole up under a rock, and left whoever found the note a upgrade item. I didn&#8217;t see her, so either she&#8217;s Hide And Seek Grand Champion, or she also fell to the same thing as the previous 1473.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5200" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1982.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, what&#8217;s so interesting about it? Well, it&#8217;s not like every run is the same, you&#8217;ll have branching paths after certain islands in the area you&#8217;re in. You&#8217;ll fight, you&#8217;ll traverse, and occasionally be given the option of going one way towards say, an Item Chest, or a Corruption that you can take on to give yourself a better shot at better rewards, should you survive. Or you can see splits for say, an Obelisk that will give you something, in exchange for possibly damaging you or taking an upgrade away. Or you can get something as simple as a shop that lets you pick from a range of upgrades in exchange for Credits you&#8217;ll pick up from crates and enemies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5202" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1985.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also enhance your character with Decryptors to unlock upgrades on three separate trees, but you aren&#8217;t pigeonholed down one path at a time, or in any particular order. Then once unlocked, you can upgrade those upgrades with Voidium, a resource you pick up from chests and crates, that does persist between runs. I don&#8217;t have many upgrades unlocked, but the ones for increased health, and health back after completing an island are almost invaluable. The most recent runs I&#8217;ve played have gone down much, much smoother with more health, and being able to heal between fights.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5203" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1986.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of, how <strong>do</strong> you heal? Well, you heal by staggering enemies, which you can do a couple different ways. First, you can stagger them with those grenades that charge back up after a few seconds, or, the even more fun way, by using the Gravity Tether. The Tether, lets you grab objects (or debris from the environments you can wreak havoc upon) and hurl them at enemies. If you get certain upgrades, you can trigger elemental effects on Tether throws, like freezing anything that was hit. So, if you <strong>really</strong> felt like it, you could log a canister of explosives at a group, and on top of blowing them up, staggering them, you can <strong>also</strong> freeze them to pick them off and grab the health and ammunition that drops for your specialized bullets. Regular ammo? Infinite, the specialized stuff? You need to find more of, but that limit can be enhanced with upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, it&#8217;s a really fun game that I&#8217;m finding more and more things out about the more that I play it. I&#8217;m finding synergies with abilities, weapon mods, grenades, all that open up new ways to play it and progress further in the story. Being able to power slide through a group of enemies, throw a chain-lightning bolt, and then lob a grenade at those stunned targets, then zip back in with a sword and hack them up is a fun time any way you, uh, &#8220;cut&#8221; it (thank you, I&#8217;ll be here all week, tip your waiter). The ability to blow up a building full of enemies, then lob chunks of that blown-up building at who&#8217;s left is a huge power-fantasy moment that you can just do, no special tricks involved. Even some of the Gamble/Relocation rooms you can go to are pretty clever, especially one that I want to spoil, but won&#8217;t. The only hint I&#8217;ll give is &#8220;don&#8217;t blink&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5204" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1983.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by the story so far with the game, I want to know who the last 1473 was, why I&#8217;m in whatever I&#8217;m in, what IDRIS is, all these things that I have questions about. Am I trapped in some kind of computer simulation? What&#8217;s the outside world look like? What is Voidaxis Industries, and what is their connection to IDRIS? I want to know, and they have me on the hook as to getting those answers because it&#8217;s all so vague and hazy at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add in that all of this is done by <strong>one guy</strong>, and I&#8217;m even more amazed at what developer Daniel Stubbington/Stubby Games has done so far, and I can&#8217;t wait to see the rest of the game. Because something like this, with a ton of intrigue, sci-fi weirdness, and questions I need answers for is <strong>so </strong>far up my alley that I bought the game without hesitation. I love FPS games that play with movement, and this game has it in spades. You move fast, you fight fast, you fight hard, and you have all these tricks that you can pull to even the odds in your favor, it&#8217;s a really fun time so far. I would most certainly recommend it to anyone who loves either genre.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/25/blaugust2025-day-25-void-breaker-impressions/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1987.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1987.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1984.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1981.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1980.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1979.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1982.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1985.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1986.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1983.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

No room for quibbling there. Later, there\'s another clause that says they may at any time stop supporting the game and that\'s an end to it. I imagine this is exactly the way the <i>Stop Killing Games </i>campaign was hoping developers would react. Nothing like a bit of clarity to calm things down.</p><p>There\'s a fair bit more about access and changes to the game and platforms and availability, all of which makes it very plain that you, the player, have some very limited rights only, to play whatever version of the game is made available to you, for as long as it\'s made available, where it\'s made available. And that\'s it.</p><p>Again, very reasonable. It just codifies in advance what has always been the reality of online gaming, that being that you have to have an up-to-date, patched version of the game to access the official servers on which the only legal version of the game will be running and that the service can be suspended or terminated at any time, with or without notice. Anyone playing any MMORPG will recognize that as their existing reality, I\'m sure.</p><p>For a demo, though, it feels a tad over the top. A demo is generally a throwaway experience, isn\'t it? Is anyone <i>really </i>expecting to be able to keep playing a demo indefinitely?</p><p>I wouldn\'t have bothered much about any of that. Par for the course for games, if not for demos. I was more interested what I could or couldn\'t say about it. And there\'s a lot about that in the small print, some of it quite unexpected.</p><p>It tells you what you can and can\'t do if you stream the game (Demo, I should say.) on <i>Twitch </i>or upload videos of you playing it to <i>YouTube</i>. It tells you how you can monetize your content via <i>Patreon </i>and how you can\'t.</p><p>I found these sections surprisingly chatty for a legal document but the intention was obviously to be helpful and supportive. Developers want people to make content about their games (By which they mean videos and streams, mainly.) and these devs also understand that people make a living doing it so they\'re willing to meet content creators halfway over monetization.</p><p>There\'s also a lengthy section about making Mods that I won\'t address because I know bugger all about Mods, neither creating them or using them. I will say that I can\'t remember seeing that aspect of the ecosystem being addressed in such detail in an EULA before but that\'s likely to be because I would have skipped right past it as irrelevant.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhP-UL1r4OMK3F4veopmKb5jqRHLxoJGKrDKIk7McoJ-WNo6SnRs6uWO1uCxMuqQIVcA9HDhi2keIZPqZzWwdJSo0HcJq_OsA_emhD-twERp9FBg8XoDJssXXYFXRs-EE0BhU8CpbuzQrRQ7RvEpKPJVkcUbwJl3PW6CY2FyFVVo9my_y4QjrsNe4KOkys/s1920/aei2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhP-UL1r4OMK3F4veopmKb5jqRHLxoJGKrDKIk7McoJ-WNo6SnRs6uWO1uCxMuqQIVcA9HDhi2keIZPqZzWwdJSo0HcJq_OsA_emhD-twERp9FBg8XoDJssXXYFXRs-EE0BhU8CpbuzQrRQ7RvEpKPJVkcUbwJl3PW6CY2FyFVVo9my_y4QjrsNe4KOkys/w640-h360/aei2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>So far, I hadn\'t seen anything that would prevent me from ticking the box and playing the demo. Or writing about it afterwards. And then I saw this:<p></p><p></p><blockquote><b><span style="font-size: medium;">"If your User Content contains "spoilers" of the story of our game, your content must contain an appropriate "spoiler warning" either at the beginning of your User Content (If your User Content contains spoilers throughout.) or at the beginning of a segment of your User Content (If the spoilers are contained within a segment of your User Content.)"</span></b></blockquote><p></p><p>That, I\'m afraid, is a condition up with which I am not prepared to put. Not for a demo, anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s a demand for editorial control, isn\'t it? It\'s telling the reviewer on what terms they may review the product. The fact that the request is entirely reasonable, in the best interest of the reviewer\'s readers or viewers and no more than any well-mannered, properly socialized reviewer would do without any prompting from anyone, is entirely irrelevant, especially when the demand is allegedly enforceable by law.</p><p>Also,<i> it\'s a demo <b>FFS!</b></i></p><p>If I was reviewing the finished game, I would without question employ spoiler warnings before getting into any detailed discussion of the plot. Not to do so would be plain rude.</p><p>But for a demo? The whole point of a demo is to showcase the game, drum up interest in it, get people excited and in the case of Steam encourage them to add it to their Wishlist. The demo should be specifically designed so that spoilers aren\'t relevant. You <i>want </i>everyone to know what\'s in it or else what the hell is the point? If you can\'t manage that, then it\'s <i>your </i>problem, not the reviewer\'s.</p><p>There aren\'t any spoilers in this post because once I read that clause I decided I wouldn\'t bother playing the demo at all. It\'s a shame because it looks like something I\'d enjoy but, hey, there are lots of games out there. It\'s not like I\'m going to miss one.&nbsp;</p><p>I might even still try it when it releases, supposedly next year. I won\'t get any reminders about it because I\'m not going to wishlist it either but if it\'s a big hit no doubt I\'ll get to hear about it anyway. I\'d have a lot fewer qualms about signing that EULA for a full game than for a demo although I still think the spoiler clause is unwarranted and presumptuous.&nbsp;</p><p>The last thing I have to say about all of this is something that actually annoyed me more than anything I\'ve mentioned so far. When you get to the end of the document there\'s a line thanking you for reading all the way through, which I couldn\'t help but read as ironic, although maybe it was meant to be taken straight, but there\'s no way to exit the EULA without agreeing to it.</p><p>Seriously? You\'re thanking me for reading it all but I\'m not allowed to say "<i>No</i>" to what I\'ve read? WTF!</p><p>There\'s no <i>Decline </i>option. Escape doesn\'t work, either. I had to close the demo from the taskbar to get back to Steam. That really pissed me off. I\'m still cross about it now.</p><p>I did at least get a blog post out of the experience so there\'s that. The Nighthawks post will have to wait until Wednesday now. Or maybe Thursday. It\'s going to be another busy week and this hasn\'t put me in any better a mood for it.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAPQUQ8ILTF4ffvcOJQPHdkprh6Fa1JvBH9jY4ZLfznCVst-kbJXnAKUiY8TGKv4Ccfov4SIvK028CwaiIXVwBW3XXA96bgD4twqXoNgLnITe01ZLXPdtMSIYqgEzy29qVI2jjh_qR3sqriUbR3bNJwv6o_Ceih_OVXGXq496qdyXbQ0wQ2x97fRBx7JA/s1920/aei1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAPQUQ8ILTF4ffvcOJQPHdkprh6Fa1JvBH9jY4ZLfznCVst-kbJXnAKUiY8TGKv4Ccfov4SIvK028CwaiIXVwBW3XXA96bgD4twqXoNgLnITe01ZLXPdtMSIYqgEzy29qVI2jjh_qR3sqriUbR3bNJwv6o_Ceih_OVXGXq496qdyXbQ0wQ2x97fRBx7JA/w640-h360/aei1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />Before I got started on my review of the <i>Nighthawks </i>demo this morning, I thought I\'d better play the last remaining demo on my list, <i>Æther&amp;Iron</i>.

Developers want people to make content about their games (By which they mean videos and streams, mainly.) and these devs also understand that people make a living doing it so they\'re willing to meet content creators halfway over monetization.</p><p>There\'s also a lengthy section about making Mods that I won\'t address because I know bugger all about Mods, neither creating them or using them. I will say that I can\'t remember seeing that aspect of the ecosystem being addressed in such detail in an EULA before but that\'s likely to be because I would have skipped right past it as irrelevant.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhP-UL1r4OMK3F4veopmKb5jqRHLxoJGKrDKIk7McoJ-WNo6SnRs6uWO1uCxMuqQIVcA9HDhi2keIZPqZzWwdJSo0HcJq_OsA_emhD-twERp9FBg8XoDJssXXYFXRs-EE0BhU8CpbuzQrRQ7RvEpKPJVkcUbwJl3PW6CY2FyFVVo9my_y4QjrsNe4KOkys/s1920/aei2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhP-UL1r4OMK3F4veopmKb5jqRHLxoJGKrDKIk7McoJ-WNo6SnRs6uWO1uCxMuqQIVcA9HDhi2keIZPqZzWwdJSo0HcJq_OsA_emhD-twERp9FBg8XoDJssXXYFXRs-EE0BhU8CpbuzQrRQ7RvEpKPJVkcUbwJl3PW6CY2FyFVVo9my_y4QjrsNe4KOkys/w640-h360/aei2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>So far, I hadn\'t seen anything that would prevent me from ticking the box and playing the demo. Or writing about it afterwards. And then I saw this:<p></p><p></p><blockquote><b><span style="font-size: medium;">"If your User Content contains "spoilers" of the story of our game, your content must contain an appropriate "spoiler warning" either at the beginning of your User Content (If your User Content contains spoilers throughout.) or at the beginning of a segment of your User Content (If the spoilers are contained within a segment of your User Content.)"</span></b></blockquote><p></p><p>That, I\'m afraid, is a condition up with which I am not prepared to put. Not for a demo, anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s a demand for editorial control, isn\'t it? It\'s telling the reviewer on what terms they may review the product. The fact that the request is entirely reasonable, in the best interest of the reviewer\'s readers or viewers and no more than any well-mannered, properly socialized reviewer would do without any prompting from anyone, is entirely irrelevant, especially when the demand is allegedly enforceable by law.</p><p>Also,<i> it\'s a demo <b>FFS!</b></i></p><p>If I was reviewing the finished game, I would without question employ spoiler warnings before getting into any detailed discussion of the plot. Not to do so would be plain rude.</p><p>But for a demo? The whole point of a demo is to showcase the game, drum up interest in it, get people excited and in the case of Steam encourage them to add it to their Wishlist. The demo should be specifically designed so that spoilers aren\'t relevant. You <i>want </i>everyone to know what\'s in it or else what the hell is the point? If you can\'t manage that, then it\'s <i>your </i>problem, not the reviewer\'s.</p><p>There aren\'t any spoilers in this post because once I read that clause I decided I wouldn\'t bother playing the demo at all. It\'s a shame because it looks like something I\'d enjoy but, hey, there are lots of games out there. It\'s not like I\'m going to miss one.&nbsp;</p><p>I might even still try it when it releases, supposedly next year. I won\'t get any reminders about it because I\'m not going to wishlist it either but if it\'s a big hit no doubt I\'ll get to hear about it anyway. I\'d have a lot fewer qualms about signing that EULA for a full game than for a demo although I still think the spoiler clause is unwarranted and presumptuous.&nbsp;</p><p>The last thing I have to say about all of this is something that actually annoyed me more than anything I\'ve mentioned so far. When you get to the end of the document there\'s a line thanking you for reading all the way through, which I couldn\'t help but read as ironic, although maybe it was meant to be taken straight, but there\'s no way to exit the EULA without agreeing to it.</p><p>Seriously? You\'re thanking me for reading it all but I\'m not allowed to say "<i>No</i>" to what I\'ve read? WTF!</p><p>There\'s no <i>Decline </i>option. Escape doesn\'t work, either. I had to close the demo from the taskbar to get back to Steam. That really pissed me off. I\'m still cross about it now.</p><p>I did at least get a blog post out of the experience so there\'s that. The Nighthawks post will have to wait until Wednesday now. Or maybe Thursday. It\'s going to be another busy week and this hasn\'t put me in any better a mood for it.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/next-fest-no-spoilers.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/next-fest-no-spoilers.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAPQUQ8ILTF4ffvcOJQPHdkprh6Fa1JvBH9jY4ZLfznCVst-kbJXnAKUiY8TGKv4Ccfov4SIvK028CwaiIXVwBW3XXA96bgD4twqXoNgLnITe01ZLXPdtMSIYqgEzy29qVI2jjh_qR3sqriUbR3bNJwv6o_Ceih_OVXGXq496qdyXbQ0wQ2x97fRBx7JA/s72-w640-h360-c/aei1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '5'}

One of the family has hired a detective\n  to investigate. That\'s you.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  The cat that hired you didn\'t bother to tell their siblings you were coming,\n  on the very valid grounds that if they had, most of them wouldn\'t have turned\n  up for the big family get-together. Consequently, none of them is very\n  favorably disposed to talk to you, although they certainly are happy enough to\n  talk <i>in front </i>of you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Listening to them doing that is most of the demo. The rest is a bit of\n  prowling around after they\'ve gone to bed, looking for clues in traditional\n  adventure game style. Except you don\'t actually move around the house as such. You just stand there and click some menu options. By co-incidence, this also turns out to\n  be how Nighthawks handles the same process, although that\'s a bit like saying\n  a butcher\'s bike is the same as a Harley-Davidson Electra Glide.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The cats themselves are all very distinctive individuals, fun to look at and\n  listen to. They look nothing like each other, which is explained by the possibility that their mother may have had many lovers. I did think\n  that went a little further toward the "<i>cat</i>" end of the spectrum than\n  anthropomorphised cat-people games usually tavel.\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQfGgOgRCrKSVTo76mAw323zY67x29Wvd7bO6-FdaF3umv-uaBvdW-fgRTavNAUpVHhUID5DABcUPphg1WtCbmmHa4QEEPWH-bfemK6wzbKKFOYbUUtKw3qYjly3iZjsOx2ds14_FYAryd5pr4UF-YNR7lzjNVHWfLc-1_tr0Cnn6WAQqGRJdOo3OL9Rg/s1920/cw5.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQfGgOgRCrKSVTo76mAw323zY67x29Wvd7bO6-FdaF3umv-uaBvdW-fgRTavNAUpVHhUID5DABcUPphg1WtCbmmHa4QEEPWH-bfemK6wzbKKFOYbUUtKw3qYjly3iZjsOx2ds14_FYAryd5pr4UF-YNR7lzjNVHWfLc-1_tr0Cnn6WAQqGRJdOo3OL9Rg/w640-h360/cw5.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>  One of the siblings is a loud-mouthed drunk, albeit good-natured with it. One\n  is some sort of goth-punk-emo teenager or twentysomething. Another is a dandy\n  and there\'s a tough-but-maternal-looking one. The worried-looking, apparently well-balanced cat is the one that\n  hired you. Oh, amd there\'s a cute kitten, too. Well, the game&nbsp;tells you&nbsp;he\'s cute.\n  I wasn\'t convinced.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p>\n<p>\n  In the seventeen minutes the demo gave me to do it, I didn\'t form much more of an\n  impression about any of them than that but according to the description on the\n  store page all eight of them are "<i>deep and flawed</i>". (Not the kitten.)\n  Also, I don\'t believe I met all eight, although I could be wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The whole thing feels a little ramshackle but not in a bad way. I wouldn\'t buy\n  it but if I got it as part of a <i>Prime Gaming</i> offer I\'d claim it and I\'d\n  probably end up playing it and enjoying it. The illustrations are charming and, if you allow\n  for the shaky translation, the writing isn\'t bad, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I haven\'t wish-listed it but that\'s not really a mark against it. If you like\n  quirky cat games, it\'d definitely be worth taking a look at the demo.

One of the family has hired a detective\n  to investigate. That\'s you.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  The cat that hired you didn\'t bother to tell their siblings you were coming,\n  on the very valid grounds that if they had, most of them wouldn\'t have turned\n  up for the big family get-together. Consequently, none of them is very\n  favorably disposed to talk to you, although they certainly are happy enough to\n  talk <i>in front </i>of you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Listening to them doing that is most of the demo. The rest is a bit of\n  prowling around after they\'ve gone to bed, looking for clues in traditional\n  adventure game style. Except you don\'t actually move around the house as such. You just stand there and click some menu options. By co-incidence, this also turns out to\n  be how Nighthawks handles the same process, although that\'s a bit like saying\n  a butcher\'s bike is the same as a Harley-Davidson Electra Glide.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The cats themselves are all very distinctive individuals, fun to look at and\n  listen to. They look nothing like each other, which is explained by the possibility that their mother may have had many lovers. I did think\n  that went a little further toward the "<i>cat</i>" end of the spectrum than\n  anthropomorphised cat-people games usually tavel.\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQfGgOgRCrKSVTo76mAw323zY67x29Wvd7bO6-FdaF3umv-uaBvdW-fgRTavNAUpVHhUID5DABcUPphg1WtCbmmHa4QEEPWH-bfemK6wzbKKFOYbUUtKw3qYjly3iZjsOx2ds14_FYAryd5pr4UF-YNR7lzjNVHWfLc-1_tr0Cnn6WAQqGRJdOo3OL9Rg/s1920/cw5.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQfGgOgRCrKSVTo76mAw323zY67x29Wvd7bO6-FdaF3umv-uaBvdW-fgRTavNAUpVHhUID5DABcUPphg1WtCbmmHa4QEEPWH-bfemK6wzbKKFOYbUUtKw3qYjly3iZjsOx2ds14_FYAryd5pr4UF-YNR7lzjNVHWfLc-1_tr0Cnn6WAQqGRJdOo3OL9Rg/w640-h360/cw5.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>  One of the siblings is a loud-mouthed drunk, albeit good-natured with it. One\n  is some sort of goth-punk-emo teenager or twentysomething. Another is a dandy\n  and there\'s a tough-but-maternal-looking one. The worried-looking, apparently well-balanced cat is the one that\n  hired you. Oh, amd there\'s a cute kitten, too. Well, the game&nbsp;tells you&nbsp;he\'s cute.\n  I wasn\'t convinced.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p>\n<p>\n  In the seventeen minutes the demo gave me to do it, I didn\'t form much more of an\n  impression about any of them than that but according to the description on the\n  store page all eight of them are "<i>deep and flawed</i>". (Not the kitten.)\n  Also, I don\'t believe I met all eight, although I could be wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The whole thing feels a little ramshackle but not in a bad way. I wouldn\'t buy\n  it but if I got it as part of a <i>Prime Gaming</i> offer I\'d claim it and I\'d\n  probably end up playing it and enjoying it. The illustrations are charming and, if you allow\n  for the shaky translation, the writing isn\'t bad, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I haven\'t wish-listed it but that\'s not really a mark against it. If you like\n  quirky cat games, it\'d definitely be worth taking a look at the demo.

I didn\'t\n  like them then and I don\'t much like those old, original versions now. That\'s\n  why, for a while, I thought I didn\'t like the modern take on the style,\n  either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Retro pixel graphics, though, don\'t really look that much like the ones I\n  remember from thirty years ago. They\'re much more nuanced and subtle and there\n  always seems to be a wealth of detail I can\'t remember noticing when the\n  originals were around. I suspect that has far more to do with the graphic\n  capabilities of the machines I play them on now, and especially the monitors,\n  than anything about the art itself. I would have been playing the old pixel\n  adventure games on a 14" CRT display at 640x480. It\'s no wonder I could hardly\n  tell what I was looking at, half the time.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So,<i> DRoA</i> looks good. That\'s a start. How does it read? After all,\n  reading the words is every bit as important as looking at the pictures in a\n  point and click adventure.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It is all reading, too. There\'s no voice acting, just a rather pleasant period\n  jazz soundtrack. The text, which displays quickly and legibly across the\n  screen, reads very well. The writing is solid, which is just as well because\n  the game opens with a fairly long dialog sequence, during which the detective\n  (<i>Jack Foster.</i>) spars with the landlord of a tenement apartment house\n  over access to a room a crime suspect is renting.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  This requires no input from the player whatsoever beyond pressing a key to\n  keep the conversation moving. It could very easily have felt frustrating as an\n  opening, were it not for the quality of that dialog, which zips along in a\n  lively, pulp-noir style.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZVA1HQx9rGjJ8sKMwwIsddD4bkQX2AG0KPZKYguqiY9WC8woOBTE0BWKuTUOCZhhVcFMJX9jVIr1w1MXRN2WhtFXzHUSa3d-jqeYul3-_Qb7PsCdWHqwhghWo-eQ1PPDa0KOUtmpfXp2IP0FjTaHuxEDTsffn9nm3Ya_Tbuiso71-f7MYTeXZWYZ-LAA/s1920/droa2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZVA1HQx9rGjJ8sKMwwIsddD4bkQX2AG0KPZKYguqiY9WC8woOBTE0BWKuTUOCZhhVcFMJX9jVIr1w1MXRN2WhtFXzHUSa3d-jqeYul3-_Qb7PsCdWHqwhghWo-eQ1PPDa0KOUtmpfXp2IP0FjTaHuxEDTsffn9nm3Ya_Tbuiso71-f7MYTeXZWYZ-LAA/w640-h360/droa2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  The writing may be retro but it\'s certainly not old-fashioned. No genuine\n  thirties pulp would have dared to be as sweary as this. In that sense - and\n  probably that sense alone - it feels extremely modern. I mean, it really\n  is&nbsp;<i>very </i>sweary indeed. Not quite <i>Roy Kent</i> in\n  <i>Ted Lasso </i>sweary but getting there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The setting is unrelentingly grim, as you\'d expect, but the tone is deftly\n  humorous. Black humor, that is. There\'s no attempt at Chandleresque pastiche,\n  thankfully. I\'ve seen enough of that to last me more than a lifetime. Instead,\n  the prose style remains grounded without ever feeling leaden. It keeps a nice\n  balance between the unpleasantness of what\'s happening and the matter-of-fact\n  reaction of the seasoned professionals who have to deal with it. Except for\n  the rookie who throws up when he sees his first decapitated corpse, of course.\n  That\'s a given.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What about the plot? Too early to say. The demo, which took me a shade under\n  half an hour to finish, doesn\'t really get far enough into the story to give\n  much away. In fact, I know little more, having played through it, than I could\n  have figured out from the title. We\'re in Arkham and there\'s been a ritual\n  murder. That\'s it. Still, enough for a demo.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Okay, then. The demo looks good, reads well, hits the right tone and\n  introduces its theme and plot effectively. That just leaves the gameplay.\n  How\'s that?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Again, solid. Maybe better than that makes it sound. It\'s not innovative,\n  original or exceptional but it doesn\'t need to be.&nbsp; It just needs to be\n  effective and familiar for what the game is aiming to be. Who wants innovation\n  or originality in a retro-noir point and click adventure, anyway? Not me and,\n  I\'d guess, very few of the players who are going to be interested enough in\n  the game to download the demo, either.\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8aPYfl0oEDQexQqIt6r1DoZ1pwbEKkq98PqMYwS71p-BhpuK-8CA2t3-Ev1gasHMHDXyRTwit7B1rFaN7wrwjW0I1w1cnfkXRj1mgtjJjDqO1JH1swS2wGLIsBgcMxA5szNmlyqK2C95Mse0dMZm2EmB0p04RcVsla8Ca8az8IaJuCocVjdS38Fb0w0Y/s1920/droa4.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8aPYfl0oEDQexQqIt6r1DoZ1pwbEKkq98PqMYwS71p-BhpuK-8CA2t3-Ev1gasHMHDXyRTwit7B1rFaN7wrwjW0I1w1cnfkXRj1mgtjJjDqO1JH1swS2wGLIsBgcMxA5szNmlyqK2C95Mse0dMZm2EmB0p04RcVsla8Ca8az8IaJuCocVjdS38Fb0w0Y/w640-h360/droa4.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  In contrast to several of the demos I\'ve reviewed so far, no-one at the\n  deliciously-named studio behind the game, <i>Postmodern Adventures</i>, is\n  attempting any wheel re-invention. The controls are just what you expect them\n  to be and the UI is minimalistic in a very unflashy fashion. At no point did I\n  have to delve into any settings to find out what something did or how to do\n  anything I wanted to do. It all just worked as should.\n</p>\n<p>\n  With the controls safely under control and out of mind, I was able to address\n  the puzzles with full concentration. There weren\'t many but I\'m pleased to be\n  able to say I figured all of them out on my own, without recourse to external\n  guides or hints. One or two took me a moment but that was only because I\n  hadn\'t passed the mouse pointer over the appropriate part of the screen\n  yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Better still, the solutions were all logical. Not <i>reasonable </i>- that\n  would be asking too much of any adventure game - but at least they made\n  sense.If you\'re a policeman with a gun, why wouldn\'t you shoot the lock off a\n  door? In fact, the solutions were so logical, I think all of them were the\n  first ideas I came up with, which really <i>is</i> unusual.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Working through the various obstacles standing in the way of investigating the\n  case was good fun and also satisfying. I figured out what to do each time well\n  before frustration or boredom began to leech the fun out of it and you can\'t\n  really ask for more from a point and click adventure.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The demo ends when you\'ve discovered the body and used your notebook to\n  recorded what little evidence there is. Then comes a slide show of images from\n  later in the game, just to give you some idea what comes next. That was\n  a&nbsp; nice touch.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a good demo. It\'s an odds-on bet that if you enjoy it you\'ll enjoy the\n  full game, so you might as well wish-list it.

I suspect that has far more to do with the graphic\n  capabilities of the machines I play them on now, and especially the monitors,\n  than anything about the art itself. I would have been playing the old pixel\n  adventure games on a 14" CRT display at 640x480. It\'s no wonder I could hardly\n  tell what I was looking at, half the time.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So,<i> DRoA</i> looks good. That\'s a start. How does it read? After all,\n  reading the words is every bit as important as looking at the pictures in a\n  point and click adventure.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It is all reading, too. There\'s no voice acting, just a rather pleasant period\n  jazz soundtrack. The text, which displays quickly and legibly across the\n  screen, reads very well. The writing is solid, which is just as well because\n  the game opens with a fairly long dialog sequence, during which the detective\n  (<i>Jack Foster.</i>) spars with the landlord of a tenement apartment house\n  over access to a room a crime suspect is renting.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  This requires no input from the player whatsoever beyond pressing a key to\n  keep the conversation moving. It could very easily have felt frustrating as an\n  opening, were it not for the quality of that dialog, which zips along in a\n  lively, pulp-noir style.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZVA1HQx9rGjJ8sKMwwIsddD4bkQX2AG0KPZKYguqiY9WC8woOBTE0BWKuTUOCZhhVcFMJX9jVIr1w1MXRN2WhtFXzHUSa3d-jqeYul3-_Qb7PsCdWHqwhghWo-eQ1PPDa0KOUtmpfXp2IP0FjTaHuxEDTsffn9nm3Ya_Tbuiso71-f7MYTeXZWYZ-LAA/s1920/droa2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZVA1HQx9rGjJ8sKMwwIsddD4bkQX2AG0KPZKYguqiY9WC8woOBTE0BWKuTUOCZhhVcFMJX9jVIr1w1MXRN2WhtFXzHUSa3d-jqeYul3-_Qb7PsCdWHqwhghWo-eQ1PPDa0KOUtmpfXp2IP0FjTaHuxEDTsffn9nm3Ya_Tbuiso71-f7MYTeXZWYZ-LAA/w640-h360/droa2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  The writing may be retro but it\'s certainly not old-fashioned. No genuine\n  thirties pulp would have dared to be as sweary as this. In that sense - and\n  probably that sense alone - it feels extremely modern. I mean, it really\n  is&nbsp;<i>very </i>sweary indeed. Not quite <i>Roy Kent</i> in\n  <i>Ted Lasso </i>sweary but getting there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The setting is unrelentingly grim, as you\'d expect, but the tone is deftly\n  humorous. Black humor, that is. There\'s no attempt at Chandleresque pastiche,\n  thankfully. I\'ve seen enough of that to last me more than a lifetime. Instead,\n  the prose style remains grounded without ever feeling leaden. It keeps a nice\n  balance between the unpleasantness of what\'s happening and the matter-of-fact\n  reaction of the seasoned professionals who have to deal with it. Except for\n  the rookie who throws up when he sees his first decapitated corpse, of course.\n  That\'s a given.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What about the plot? Too early to say. The demo, which took me a shade under\n  half an hour to finish, doesn\'t really get far enough into the story to give\n  much away. In fact, I know little more, having played through it, than I could\n  have figured out from the title. We\'re in Arkham and there\'s been a ritual\n  murder. That\'s it. Still, enough for a demo.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Okay, then. The demo looks good, reads well, hits the right tone and\n  introduces its theme and plot effectively. That just leaves the gameplay.\n  How\'s that?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Again, solid. Maybe better than that makes it sound. It\'s not innovative,\n  original or exceptional but it doesn\'t need to be.&nbsp; It just needs to be\n  effective and familiar for what the game is aiming to be. Who wants innovation\n  or originality in a retro-noir point and click adventure, anyway? Not me and,\n  I\'d guess, very few of the players who are going to be interested enough in\n  the game to download the demo, either.\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8aPYfl0oEDQexQqIt6r1DoZ1pwbEKkq98PqMYwS71p-BhpuK-8CA2t3-Ev1gasHMHDXyRTwit7B1rFaN7wrwjW0I1w1cnfkXRj1mgtjJjDqO1JH1swS2wGLIsBgcMxA5szNmlyqK2C95Mse0dMZm2EmB0p04RcVsla8Ca8az8IaJuCocVjdS38Fb0w0Y/s1920/droa4.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8aPYfl0oEDQexQqIt6r1DoZ1pwbEKkq98PqMYwS71p-BhpuK-8CA2t3-Ev1gasHMHDXyRTwit7B1rFaN7wrwjW0I1w1cnfkXRj1mgtjJjDqO1JH1swS2wGLIsBgcMxA5szNmlyqK2C95Mse0dMZm2EmB0p04RcVsla8Ca8az8IaJuCocVjdS38Fb0w0Y/w640-h360/droa4.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  In contrast to several of the demos I\'ve reviewed so far, no-one at the\n  deliciously-named studio behind the game, <i>Postmodern Adventures</i>, is\n  attempting any wheel re-invention. The controls are just what you expect them\n  to be and the UI is minimalistic in a very unflashy fashion. At no point did I\n  have to delve into any settings to find out what something did or how to do\n  anything I wanted to do. It all just worked as should.\n</p>\n<p>\n  With the controls safely under control and out of mind, I was able to address\n  the puzzles with full concentration. There weren\'t many but I\'m pleased to be\n  able to say I figured all of them out on my own, without recourse to external\n  guides or hints. One or two took me a moment but that was only because I\n  hadn\'t passed the mouse pointer over the appropriate part of the screen\n  yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Better still, the solutions were all logical. Not <i>reasonable </i>- that\n  would be asking too much of any adventure game - but at least they made\n  sense.If you\'re a policeman with a gun, why wouldn\'t you shoot the lock off a\n  door? In fact, the solutions were so logical, I think all of them were the\n  first ideas I came up with, which really <i>is</i> unusual.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Working through the various obstacles standing in the way of investigating the\n  case was good fun and also satisfying. I figured out what to do each time well\n  before frustration or boredom began to leech the fun out of it and you can\'t\n  really ask for more from a point and click adventure.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The demo ends when you\'ve discovered the body and used your notebook to\n  recorded what little evidence there is. Then comes a slide show of images from\n  later in the game, just to give you some idea what comes next. That was\n  a&nbsp; nice touch.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a good demo. It\'s an odds-on bet that if you enjoy it you\'ll enjoy the\n  full game, so you might as well wish-list it.

At that point, I\'d played for just under an\nhour. My played time on <i>Steam </i>now stands at 96 minutes but that extra half an\nhour or so has made a big difference to what I would have said about it. I\nalready liked it but having seen more, I&nbsp;<i>really</i> like it!\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Often I find demos that have been specifically created <i>as </i>demos give a\n  better indication of what the full game will be like than than those that just\n  give you the the opening chapter or two but this does appear to be the largely unedited opening of the game. If so, it works extremely well.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The demo opens with a disturbing black and white sequence in which the main\n  character, <i>Amelia</i>, is being interrogated by a bunch of shadowy figures, whose faces can\'t be seen. She\'s clearly under investigation for something she\'s done and they\'re looking for her to give a frank and full account of whatever it is that just happened.</p><p>\n  From there, the game moves into flashback, narrated by Amelia, as she attempts to explain everything to their satisfaction. Her flashbacks are where the bulk of the game takes place. Intermittently as you play, the scene shifts\n  back to the interrogation and Amelia has to justify her actions or\n  elaborate on them to the satisfaction of her interrogators. That makes for an atmospheric and somewhat unsettling start but things are\n  only going to get worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Amelia recalls leaving her evening classes around\n  eight in the evening on Friday 8 December, 2079, intending to go home to her&nbsp;very\n  exclusive and expensive Paris apartment, which we later learn her mother\n  bought seven years ago, when Amelia started secondary school. I\'m not\n  wholly up to speed with the French education system, even assuming it won\'t be\n  very different half a century from now, but I would guess that puts her in her very late teens or even her early twenties.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Amelia calls a self-driving car, one of her mother\'s. Amelia\'s family, we will\n  learn, is <i>very </i>rich. And very old. And very important. In the car, Amelia\n  calls her boyfriend and they have a long conversation about role-playing\n  games.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju0ejjVP_dKHy9Vf4lXKFtPmhsHUIvAlVtbFJOAx3E78n_abdWg9jJimFddtW4IrM1oNlakSUzbhBd5r_kfgFappslR4Pv90xXr3aPQMiW4alKT7bQxFqNjYeU4Fy8lkJ-cNx0NXyRiQR2xpkf-0SJHzQPDAjw1qeYvpXirHU7Y5Fb-kjm3xWDJ6G7JCY/s1920/disscar2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju0ejjVP_dKHy9Vf4lXKFtPmhsHUIvAlVtbFJOAx3E78n_abdWg9jJimFddtW4IrM1oNlakSUzbhBd5r_kfgFappslR4Pv90xXr3aPQMiW4alKT7bQxFqNjYeU4Fy8lkJ-cNx0NXyRiQR2xpkf-0SJHzQPDAjw1qeYvpXirHU7Y5Fb-kjm3xWDJ6G7JCY/w640-h360/disscar2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  This seemed quite unlikely and it gave me some mild\n  forebodings about how arch and fan-servicey the writing might get, all of which\n  turned out to be completely unfounded. The game is excellently written,\n  nuanced and layered, subtle and surprising. The translation is excellent, too.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>&nbsp;motif turns out to be entirely\n  relevant and not at all a fantasy about how you can have a hot, rich\n  girlfriend who invites you to come to her place and spend the night because her parents are away, even though your main interest in life is sitting in front of a screen, designing dungeon\n  levels. I mean, that\'s totally a thing that happens, right?</p>\n<p>\n  While she\'s speaking to her boyfriend, Amelia gets a call from her mother, who\n  I thought seemed oddly insistent on apologizing for decisions she made years\n  ago. It\'s very subtle but I think there\'s some kind of foreshadowing there. They have something of a rapprochement and Amelia gets\n  so caught up in the conversation, she doesn\'t even notice the car has left Paris\n  and is heading out into the night.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  When she does realize she\'s been kidnapped by a self-driving car, she panics a\n  bit but before she can get too distraught she gets yet another call, this time\n  from her good friend <i>Iris</i>, who tells her she\'s behind the unscheduled change\n  of destination. She won\'t tell Amelia much else except that she doesn\'t need\n  to freak out and that Iris needs her for some "s<i>pecial project</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s totally re-assuring, right? I mean, <i>you\'d</i> be fine with being abducted on that premise, wouldn\'t you? Especially by someone who, as we learn is the case with Iris and Amelia, you\'ve never actually met in in person, only online.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The car ends up at a castle deep in the countryside, which is where the game\n  finally lets the player into the action. It didn\'t feel like too long to wait\n  at all. I found the whole introduction compelling.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Amelia is less worried about being dropped in a deserted castle in the middle\n  of nowhere by a driver-less car that promptly leaves&nbsp;than you might expect and for good reason. It\'s\n  her castle.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLp2PMjh5Y_-Qszk8uwDU-Fz3JoD23fZPjfH2aTVj853wdkmI3MdJNwBQvZl3wzeJOzOreNKRJ5lSzTLOwmxCfDz96wZdASrouxgZfB4ZlvfalTGm5njUE1V7Csywz5zS4ABcDfOSymI2VTD8jvbJwThBW2gYsHqHiO6yBa5d1pi2pbTWJX3jye7pemfU/s1920/diss1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLp2PMjh5Y_-Qszk8uwDU-Fz3JoD23fZPjfH2aTVj853wdkmI3MdJNwBQvZl3wzeJOzOreNKRJ5lSzTLOwmxCfDz96wZdASrouxgZfB4ZlvfalTGm5njUE1V7Csywz5zS4ABcDfOSymI2VTD8jvbJwThBW2gYsHqHiO6yBa5d1pi2pbTWJX3jye7pemfU/w640-h360/diss1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</p>Well, her family\'s. They own it and it\'s where she spent many a happy family\n  holiday in her childhood. At this point she\'s suspecting her mother may have\n  something to do with what\'s going on (You think?) but she\'s understandably still not at\n  all happy about it.\n<p></p>\n\n<p>\n  From then on the player has full control over Amelia\'s movements and actions, at least when she\'s not in the interrogation room. The game uses a nice three-quarter\n  angle I found very easy to get on with and although there\'s a\n  warning that it was designed with a controller in mind, I found it very\n  comfortable to play with the keyboard. The mouse isn\'t used at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once in the castle, gameplay comes in two parts: exploration and turn-based\n  combat. Only part of the building is available to explore in the demo but even that seems\n  like a lot. There are a number of rooms you can go in right away and more that open\n  after certain criteria are met. There\'s also a large outdoor area with formal\n  gardens and a courtyard and a small observatory. And there\'s a\n  dungeon, although in the demo it only seems to exist to give the androids a place to hang out and... drink?</p>\n<p>\n  To save a lot of exposition and explanation, what happens is that Amelia finds\n  she\'s been brought to the castle to play a game. A kind of LARP with androids. She acquires a tablet device\n  that allows her to print copies of soldiers to fight for her. The tablet also protects her from attacks. When it\n  fails, the fight ends but Amelia cannot be harmed. Or so people kept telling\n  her. I\'m not sure she or I believed it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All fights have to be initiated by Amelia. She\'s never attacked. They\'re all\n  set-piece battles, clearly framed as some kind of test within the framework of the game. Both the game Amelia is playing and the actual video game. It\'s clever.</p><p>Initially, fights are mostly trial and error. There\'s little information about the opponents or their abilities&nbsp; but as soon as you defeat one you learn its\n  strategies, which you can apply to other, similar enemies. Or you could work\n  it out from observation. In these early stages, at least, it\'s usually something simple like "<i>Always attacks the person farthest away</i>". I imagine things get more complicated later on.</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjueXQyDCYZVCLhITSbVUffjw4M_ysop2hBcT3tBinu0meKf6u5mSZK-fdX7HgSxBFZJg_BGAP0f9HUfvS_D8RKrVD2FWV7COaIOG6pE1nW100VtrfmatEta0IHZmrvYl3rIJ9cec6HJ8oOcjPhq8juDB-VBtHx4g2df78SVMNcZThjl0_A4Xh_XDDfom0/s1920/diss2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjueXQyDCYZVCLhITSbVUffjw4M_ysop2hBcT3tBinu0meKf6u5mSZK-fdX7HgSxBFZJg_BGAP0f9HUfvS_D8RKrVD2FWV7COaIOG6pE1nW100VtrfmatEta0IHZmrvYl3rIJ9cec6HJ8oOcjPhq8juDB-VBtHx4g2df78SVMNcZThjl0_A4Xh_XDDfom0/w640-h360/diss2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n  The game isn\'t a roguelike per se but you can re-fight each battle as often as\n  you want and you learn from each loss, so in a way it\'s similar. I\n  found the fights very much scratched my itch for thoughtful, tactical,\n  turn-based combat. They were fun. I didn\'t mind repeating them.<p></p><p>Then again, there weren\'t enough of them for it to become tedious. I only saw three but there was at least one more I saw the set-up for but didn\'t do.\n  Although the thrust of the "<i>game</i>" Amelia is playing involves those\n  fights, the game<i> I </i>was playing had far more to do with Amelia\' trying to work out what the hell was going on. And it\'s a fascinating scenario.</p>\n<p>\n  The "<i>soldiers</i>" are AI-controlled robots. Or they might be. Amelia is\n  familiar with AI and works with it in her studies. Also, her mother is deeply involved it commercially and professionally. But these are far more sophisticated units than\n  she\'s used to seeing. They\'re so convincing, she wonders if they might be being remotely controlled\n  by humans but the AIs say not and eventually she believes them.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They are also humanoid, which apparently is absolutely illegal in 2079. Amelia\n  suspects they may be some outlaw work of her mother\'s. It&nbsp; certainly explains why\n  she\'s being interrogated.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Dissimilar is one of those games that doesn\'t give you much in the way of\n  exposition, relying instead on supposition and internal narrative. Everything\n  you learn comes from Amelia\'s interior monologue and the increasingly probing\n  questions she asks the AIs, none of which is able to answer her directly on\n  anything but the game she\'s supposed to be playing but some of whom reveal more than they mean to anyway.</p>\n<p>\n  I loved all of that. It\'s exactly my kind of story-telling. Abstruse, veiled and elliptical. I found the\n  world-building fascinating and the plot intriguing, too. Couple all of that to some\n  gorgeous graphics and entertaining gameplay and you have a game that\'s going\n  straight onto my wish-list.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The best part wasn\'t any of that, though. It was the way it ended.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgA1cOInGeqXsVkkkx1-QMgAFm5JfONJZOnJsPtquVAVFUx04xMGGbBPaPPZESAjjRdszAoeVN3Lw7dlU7VnfU5FcasS8aoHTUKSR2uniGL-8MJAeZN7RO3jtK4IA1K-fo-qZzrNKeWmKkF_oJHM2xSBJU1fVkkQj2O8lLKghgaY-RZmW0N98SFghxAgAE/s1920/diss3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgA1cOInGeqXsVkkkx1-QMgAFm5JfONJZOnJsPtquVAVFUx04xMGGbBPaPPZESAjjRdszAoeVN3Lw7dlU7VnfU5FcasS8aoHTUKSR2uniGL-8MJAeZN7RO3jtK4IA1K-fo-qZzrNKeWmKkF_oJHM2xSBJU1fVkkQj2O8lLKghgaY-RZmW0N98SFghxAgAE/w640-h360/diss3.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>There is a "<i>normal</i>" end to\n  the demo, where you meet some hidden criterion and the game gives you a score,\n  tells you you\'re done and invites you to carry on anyway to see anything you\n  might have missed. I got that one. Then I carried on.<p></p>\n<p>\n  Much better was learning I could can win the game by not playing at all.\n  Well, not "<i>win</i>" so much as "<i>finish</i>". But it felt like a win all\n  the same.\n</p><p>When I play pre-defined characters in narrative-driven games, I often find\n  myself wishing the character I\'m playing would just say no sometimes.

At that point, I\'d played for just under an\nhour. My played time on <i>Steam </i>now stands at 96 minutes but that extra half an\nhour or so has made a big difference to what I would have said about it. I\nalready liked it but having seen more, I&nbsp;<i>really</i> like it!\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Often I find demos that have been specifically created <i>as </i>demos give a\n  better indication of what the full game will be like than than those that just\n  give you the the opening chapter or two but this does appear to be the largely unedited opening of the game. If so, it works extremely well.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The demo opens with a disturbing black and white sequence in which the main\n  character, <i>Amelia</i>, is being interrogated by a bunch of shadowy figures, whose faces can\'t be seen. She\'s clearly under investigation for something she\'s done and they\'re looking for her to give a frank and full account of whatever it is that just happened.</p><p>\n  From there, the game moves into flashback, narrated by Amelia, as she attempts to explain everything to their satisfaction. Her flashbacks are where the bulk of the game takes place. Intermittently as you play, the scene shifts\n  back to the interrogation and Amelia has to justify her actions or\n  elaborate on them to the satisfaction of her interrogators. That makes for an atmospheric and somewhat unsettling start but things are\n  only going to get worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Amelia recalls leaving her evening classes around\n  eight in the evening on Friday 8 December, 2079, intending to go home to her&nbsp;very\n  exclusive and expensive Paris apartment, which we later learn her mother\n  bought seven years ago, when Amelia started secondary school. I\'m not\n  wholly up to speed with the French education system, even assuming it won\'t be\n  very different half a century from now, but I would guess that puts her in her very late teens or even her early twenties.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Amelia calls a self-driving car, one of her mother\'s. Amelia\'s family, we will\n  learn, is <i>very </i>rich. And very old. And very important. In the car, Amelia\n  calls her boyfriend and they have a long conversation about role-playing\n  games.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju0ejjVP_dKHy9Vf4lXKFtPmhsHUIvAlVtbFJOAx3E78n_abdWg9jJimFddtW4IrM1oNlakSUzbhBd5r_kfgFappslR4Pv90xXr3aPQMiW4alKT7bQxFqNjYeU4Fy8lkJ-cNx0NXyRiQR2xpkf-0SJHzQPDAjw1qeYvpXirHU7Y5Fb-kjm3xWDJ6G7JCY/s1920/disscar2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju0ejjVP_dKHy9Vf4lXKFtPmhsHUIvAlVtbFJOAx3E78n_abdWg9jJimFddtW4IrM1oNlakSUzbhBd5r_kfgFappslR4Pv90xXr3aPQMiW4alKT7bQxFqNjYeU4Fy8lkJ-cNx0NXyRiQR2xpkf-0SJHzQPDAjw1qeYvpXirHU7Y5Fb-kjm3xWDJ6G7JCY/w640-h360/disscar2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  This seemed quite unlikely and it gave me some mild\n  forebodings about how arch and fan-servicey the writing might get, all of which\n  turned out to be completely unfounded. The game is excellently written,\n  nuanced and layered, subtle and surprising. The translation is excellent, too.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>&nbsp;motif turns out to be entirely\n  relevant and not at all a fantasy about how you can have a hot, rich\n  girlfriend who invites you to come to her place and spend the night because her parents are away, even though your main interest in life is sitting in front of a screen, designing dungeon\n  levels. I mean, that\'s totally a thing that happens, right?</p>\n<p>\n  While she\'s speaking to her boyfriend, Amelia gets a call from her mother, who\n  I thought seemed oddly insistent on apologizing for decisions she made years\n  ago. It\'s very subtle but I think there\'s some kind of foreshadowing there. They have something of a rapprochement and Amelia gets\n  so caught up in the conversation, she doesn\'t even notice the car has left Paris\n  and is heading out into the night.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  When she does realize she\'s been kidnapped by a self-driving car, she panics a\n  bit but before she can get too distraught she gets yet another call, this time\n  from her good friend <i>Iris</i>, who tells her she\'s behind the unscheduled change\n  of destination. She won\'t tell Amelia much else except that she doesn\'t need\n  to freak out and that Iris needs her for some "s<i>pecial project</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s totally re-assuring, right? I mean, <i>you\'d</i> be fine with being abducted on that premise, wouldn\'t you? Especially by someone who, as we learn is the case with Iris and Amelia, you\'ve never actually met in in person, only online.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The car ends up at a castle deep in the countryside, which is where the game\n  finally lets the player into the action. It didn\'t feel like too long to wait\n  at all. I found the whole introduction compelling.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Amelia is less worried about being dropped in a deserted castle in the middle\n  of nowhere by a driver-less car that promptly leaves&nbsp;than you might expect and for good reason. It\'s\n  her castle.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLp2PMjh5Y_-Qszk8uwDU-Fz3JoD23fZPjfH2aTVj853wdkmI3MdJNwBQvZl3wzeJOzOreNKRJ5lSzTLOwmxCfDz96wZdASrouxgZfB4ZlvfalTGm5njUE1V7Csywz5zS4ABcDfOSymI2VTD8jvbJwThBW2gYsHqHiO6yBa5d1pi2pbTWJX3jye7pemfU/s1920/diss1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLp2PMjh5Y_-Qszk8uwDU-Fz3JoD23fZPjfH2aTVj853wdkmI3MdJNwBQvZl3wzeJOzOreNKRJ5lSzTLOwmxCfDz96wZdASrouxgZfB4ZlvfalTGm5njUE1V7Csywz5zS4ABcDfOSymI2VTD8jvbJwThBW2gYsHqHiO6yBa5d1pi2pbTWJX3jye7pemfU/w640-h360/diss1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</p>Well, her family\'s. They own it and it\'s where she spent many a happy family\n  holiday in her childhood. At this point she\'s suspecting her mother may have\n  something to do with what\'s going on (You think?) but she\'s understandably still not at\n  all happy about it.\n<p></p>\n\n<p>\n  From then on the player has full control over Amelia\'s movements and actions, at least when she\'s not in the interrogation room. The game uses a nice three-quarter\n  angle I found very easy to get on with and although there\'s a\n  warning that it was designed with a controller in mind, I found it very\n  comfortable to play with the keyboard. The mouse isn\'t used at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once in the castle, gameplay comes in two parts: exploration and turn-based\n  combat. Only part of the building is available to explore in the demo but even that seems\n  like a lot. There are a number of rooms you can go in right away and more that open\n  after certain criteria are met. There\'s also a large outdoor area with formal\n  gardens and a courtyard and a small observatory. And there\'s a\n  dungeon, although in the demo it only seems to exist to give the androids a place to hang out and... drink?</p>\n<p>\n  To save a lot of exposition and explanation, what happens is that Amelia finds\n  she\'s been brought to the castle to play a game. A kind of LARP with androids. She acquires a tablet device\n  that allows her to print copies of soldiers to fight for her. The tablet also protects her from attacks. When it\n  fails, the fight ends but Amelia cannot be harmed. Or so people kept telling\n  her. I\'m not sure she or I believed it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All fights have to be initiated by Amelia. She\'s never attacked. They\'re all\n  set-piece battles, clearly framed as some kind of test within the framework of the game. Both the game Amelia is playing and the actual video game. It\'s clever.</p><p>Initially, fights are mostly trial and error. There\'s little information about the opponents or their abilities&nbsp; but as soon as you defeat one you learn its\n  strategies, which you can apply to other, similar enemies. Or you could work\n  it out from observation. In these early stages, at least, it\'s usually something simple like "<i>Always attacks the person farthest away</i>". I imagine things get more complicated later on.</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjueXQyDCYZVCLhITSbVUffjw4M_ysop2hBcT3tBinu0meKf6u5mSZK-fdX7HgSxBFZJg_BGAP0f9HUfvS_D8RKrVD2FWV7COaIOG6pE1nW100VtrfmatEta0IHZmrvYl3rIJ9cec6HJ8oOcjPhq8juDB-VBtHx4g2df78SVMNcZThjl0_A4Xh_XDDfom0/s1920/diss2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjueXQyDCYZVCLhITSbVUffjw4M_ysop2hBcT3tBinu0meKf6u5mSZK-fdX7HgSxBFZJg_BGAP0f9HUfvS_D8RKrVD2FWV7COaIOG6pE1nW100VtrfmatEta0IHZmrvYl3rIJ9cec6HJ8oOcjPhq8juDB-VBtHx4g2df78SVMNcZThjl0_A4Xh_XDDfom0/w640-h360/diss2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n  The game isn\'t a roguelike per se but you can re-fight each battle as often as\n  you want and you learn from each loss, so in a way it\'s similar. I\n  found the fights very much scratched my itch for thoughtful, tactical,\n  turn-based combat. They were fun. I didn\'t mind repeating them.<p></p><p>Then again, there weren\'t enough of them for it to become tedious. I only saw three but there was at least one more I saw the set-up for but didn\'t do.\n  Although the thrust of the "<i>game</i>" Amelia is playing involves those\n  fights, the game<i> I </i>was playing had far more to do with Amelia\' trying to work out what the hell was going on. And it\'s a fascinating scenario.</p>\n<p>\n  The "<i>soldiers</i>" are AI-controlled robots. Or they might be. Amelia is\n  familiar with AI and works with it in her studies. Also, her mother is deeply involved it commercially and professionally. But these are far more sophisticated units than\n  she\'s used to seeing. They\'re so convincing, she wonders if they might be being remotely controlled\n  by humans but the AIs say not and eventually she believes them.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They are also humanoid, which apparently is absolutely illegal in 2079. Amelia\n  suspects they may be some outlaw work of her mother\'s. It&nbsp; certainly explains why\n  she\'s being interrogated.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Dissimilar is one of those games that doesn\'t give you much in the way of\n  exposition, relying instead on supposition and internal narrative. Everything\n  you learn comes from Amelia\'s interior monologue and the increasingly probing\n  questions she asks the AIs, none of which is able to answer her directly on\n  anything but the game she\'s supposed to be playing but some of whom reveal more than they mean to anyway.</p>\n<p>\n  I loved all of that. It\'s exactly my kind of story-telling. Abstruse, veiled and elliptical. I found the\n  world-building fascinating and the plot intriguing, too. Couple all of that to some\n  gorgeous graphics and entertaining gameplay and you have a game that\'s going\n  straight onto my wish-list.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The best part wasn\'t any of that, though. It was the way it ended.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgA1cOInGeqXsVkkkx1-QMgAFm5JfONJZOnJsPtquVAVFUx04xMGGbBPaPPZESAjjRdszAoeVN3Lw7dlU7VnfU5FcasS8aoHTUKSR2uniGL-8MJAeZN7RO3jtK4IA1K-fo-qZzrNKeWmKkF_oJHM2xSBJU1fVkkQj2O8lLKghgaY-RZmW0N98SFghxAgAE/s1920/diss3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgA1cOInGeqXsVkkkx1-QMgAFm5JfONJZOnJsPtquVAVFUx04xMGGbBPaPPZESAjjRdszAoeVN3Lw7dlU7VnfU5FcasS8aoHTUKSR2uniGL-8MJAeZN7RO3jtK4IA1K-fo-qZzrNKeWmKkF_oJHM2xSBJU1fVkkQj2O8lLKghgaY-RZmW0N98SFghxAgAE/w640-h360/diss3.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>There is a "<i>normal</i>" end to\n  the demo, where you meet some hidden criterion and the game gives you a score,\n  tells you you\'re done and invites you to carry on anyway to see anything you\n  might have missed. I got that one. Then I carried on.<p></p>\n<p>\n  Much better was learning I could can win the game by not playing at all.\n  Well, not "<i>win</i>" so much as "<i>finish</i>". But it felt like a win all\n  the same.\n</p><p>When I play pre-defined characters in narrative-driven games, I often find\n  myself wishing the character I\'m playing would just say no sometimes.

Things went much faster than I was expecting, although not for the reason I might have wished. I didn\'t really get into it and spend a lot longer playing than I thought I would. Just the opposite, in fact, as we\'re about to find out.<p></p><p>Here are the four demos I\'ve played so far, in descending order by how long Steam tells me I spent playing each of them:</p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Dissimilar</span></i> - 59 minutes&nbsp;</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Nova Antarctica</span></i> - 31 minutes</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Atomic Age</span></i> - 23 minutes</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Magic World</span></i> - 5 minutes</b></p><p>Let me break those timings down a little.&nbsp;</p><p>I haven\'t finished playing the <i>Dissimilar </i>demo. I stopped at a convenient point because it was getting late. I was having a pretty good time with it and the only reason I haven\'t gone back to finish it is because I thought I ought to get some of the others out of the way first.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, I\'ve played the whole of the <i>Nova Antarctica</i> demo twice. It has a fifteen-minute lockout.</p><p>The <i>Atomic Ag</i>e demo might last any amount of time. I wouldn\'t know. I got stuck in the very first location and decided enough was enough.</p><p>And the <i>Magic World</i> demo turned out not to be a demo of the game at all.</p><p>Now the reviews. I\'ll take them in reverse order, saving the best for last.&nbsp;</p><p><i><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Magic World </b></span></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is a demo for a game that supposed to be an open world MMORPG. Maybe it will be, one day. I wouldn\'t put my money on it. Certainly no-one, not even the developers, are claiming its an MMORPG yet.</p><p>The first thing you see when you hit Play is this warning:</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjAWIDnuKmTgky8wgnrZCLlR9ojA_LI_xeUymUYl72sB6yr-nTXrKOLUO0iDUq2OWLX8Iwfx6dHEqVeHFhwLySW6-gXGwZskPEMnbgQUrfhwkeuz-iag-wx511GcAxknxbRixJY4m608q6UnpGHPJNwIjxpkY29IQGnPvteU5DpMAmWVDXWF_48njgoDk/s1241/mwdemo1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="244" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjAWIDnuKmTgky8wgnrZCLlR9ojA_LI_xeUymUYl72sB6yr-nTXrKOLUO0iDUq2OWLX8Iwfx6dHEqVeHFhwLySW6-gXGwZskPEMnbgQUrfhwkeuz-iag-wx511GcAxknxbRixJY4m608q6UnpGHPJNwIjxpkY29IQGnPvteU5DpMAmWVDXWF_48njgoDk/w640-h244/mwdemo1.png" width="640" /></a></div>At best, it\'s a tech demo, although even that\'s pushing it. It\'s a very basic draft of the proposed magic system as it relates to combat. There\'s a short tutorial, using placeholder graphics, in which you move through a series of featureless corridors and open spaces, following instructions on how to move your mouse and press keys to fire spells at an opponent or protect yourself from attacks. There are also options to duel other players and fight NPC opponents, neither of which I felt the slightest inclination to do.<p></p><p>Steam tells me it took five minutes to get to the end of the tutorial but it felt a lot longer than that. I never expected to enjoy the gimmick of moving my mouse while pressing a key in order to cast a spell but this was even less fun than I thought it would be. No fun at all, in fact.</p><p>I can easily imagine a VR game, where you have to wave a wand around to cast spells, being both exciting and immersive but this is neither. The idea of simulating somatic gestures by moving your mouse left and right or up and down seems doomed to failure form the start. Who would find that more enjoyable than any of many variations on action combat we have already?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhT0li4geRjg_nG3toOLCKQ__5JtqjXDrkKKOwRUwsSZQSWZ299zBgUEecths-cDYsVKUAlem4rzPid90pks8VtzEPq0kzqeGr03agOQdv8hyphenhyphenCRw7OtfUOrQi2tuTtH2yIzb-wosqbCZtJOC4VvyuPvgaldUsD2oN0Nrhr_nWd5RH7F8YbWEc28xHYJbo/s1920/mw3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhT0li4geRjg_nG3toOLCKQ__5JtqjXDrkKKOwRUwsSZQSWZ299zBgUEecths-cDYsVKUAlem4rzPid90pks8VtzEPq0kzqeGr03agOQdv8hyphenhyphenCRw7OtfUOrQi2tuTtH2yIzb-wosqbCZtJOC4VvyuPvgaldUsD2oN0Nrhr_nWd5RH7F8YbWEc28xHYJbo/w640-h360/mw3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Not me, that\'s for sure. As for the demo not including anything that makes the game an MMORPG, I think it\'s perfectly reasonable for the devs to put up a tech demo and ask for feedback. I just don\'t want to be the one playing it. Looking at the game\'s store page, it does explain that\'s what it is (Kind of...). I didn\'t see that when I chose it and if I had I would never have downloaded it. I don\'t think it was made clear in the Next Fest entry but I might just have missed it.</p><p>Also, to answer a question that came up in the comments last time, the store page clarifies that the images they\'re currently using to promote it <i>are </i>indeed generated by AI but they promise no AI content will be used in the game itself. Judging by what\'s available so far, I would imagine by the time the actual game arrives, AI will be so embedded in game development generally, no-one will care any more.</p><p><b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Atomic Age</i></span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i></i></span></b></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5m-RNqzTC5Ut786esSyOgbspLUXuAR3wYCEPV2slI5aGBTZ6sWfSpg_-thVc-F6oJ4eJhloC4CdPEfJy5iV67HDcxBr3zSh93EFLSnYyNVcfcZb0vLt7skHfdaf8bHnHuNJbrZL1r4qYuP2L-KaS9dT2zuBgl26K3vFbJ5dmGBtWI7XTG9ws03Hq8MqU/s1924/aa2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="354" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5m-RNqzTC5Ut786esSyOgbspLUXuAR3wYCEPV2slI5aGBTZ6sWfSpg_-thVc-F6oJ4eJhloC4CdPEfJy5iV67HDcxBr3zSh93EFLSnYyNVcfcZb0vLt7skHfdaf8bHnHuNJbrZL1r4qYuP2L-KaS9dT2zuBgl26K3vFbJ5dmGBtWI7XTG9ws03Hq8MqU/w640-h354/aa2.jpg" width="640" /></a></i></span></b></div><b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i><br /></i></span></b>This one looked every bit as good as I hoped it would. Well, it did in the one location I ever got to see...&nbsp;<p></p><p>It begins with the main character addressing the player directly, telling you who he is and what he does as he sets up the premise for the game. The dialog is solid enough and the voice actor does a good job putting it across. I was feeling like this might go well.</p><p>Then there came a couple of opportunities for me, the player, to ask questions in the traditional "<i>Pick one response from three</i>" mode and those started to give me some concerns. All three options felt a little off, somehow. They didn\'t feel like they\'d been written by the same person who\'d done the dialog. They had a different tone altogether, one I didn\'t much take to.</p><p>That discomfiting dissonance continued once the introduction ended and the game itself began. There was some conversation between the character I was playing and the mustachioed gentleman I\'d come to see for an interview. None of it felt quite right. Then the gent and his female companion left, locking the door behind them and leaving me trapped in the room</p><p>Side-stepping the issue of how wildly unrealistic this is (Have <i>you </i>ever been for an interview that ended with the interviewer, accidentally-or-otherwise, locking you in the interview room?) the real problem was that I couldn\'t get out. I\'m used to adventure game logic, where I end up trying every interactable object with every other interactable object until some entirely ridiculous combination does the trick although usually I don\'t have the patience for trial and error and just look it up.</p><p>This time, there were few enough objects that it seemed quite feasible to try every combination. The problem was none of them worked.</p><p>I opened the cupboard and took the rope. I found the Personal Assistant robot in the bin full of spare parts. I found the Operating Manual on the shelf. I attached the rope to the fruit machine that dispenses batteries as prizes. (Best not ask too many questions about that.) I got a battery, which I put into the PA to get it working.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-DPjSqQnLE9uLtq323EmWhDQg1wsh5Y0BmeV5aIAjIYK9Xj8srjaP_AIyTqZU_3nKt9Ljn0oU1C0pDlW62Jsb4EbFAcz7zB6PctrwR4VvW8T5w_48yIJexQRcWN1bK0dPAhoOZBC-rkm2wDRhfNFb9_Gm8eh-NvdAh1ezL-GJR9Ct9nWcICcmzjUk2V4/s1924/aa3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="354" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-DPjSqQnLE9uLtq323EmWhDQg1wsh5Y0BmeV5aIAjIYK9Xj8srjaP_AIyTqZU_3nKt9Ljn0oU1C0pDlW62Jsb4EbFAcz7zB6PctrwR4VvW8T5w_48yIJexQRcWN1bK0dPAhoOZBC-rkm2wDRhfNFb9_Gm8eh-NvdAh1ezL-GJR9Ct9nWcICcmzjUk2V4/w640-h354/aa3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>And then I was stumped. Those were all the usable items I could find apart from a gramophone and the door. Using the gramophone caused a drawer at the bottom to open and close and that was all. No item would interact with it, open or closed. Nothing would interact with the door. None of the items worked on or with each other.</p><p>I googled for a walkthrough but it seems no-one has bothered to write one. Or even complain about being stuck. At which point, I decided I had better things to do with my time and called it a day.</p><p>Apart from the unplayabilty of it all, I found the controls annoying. In most point&amp;click adventures, you <i>Examine </i>with RMB and <i>Use </i>with LMB. This one does the opposite. Either I or B usually opens your inventory. Here, neither does. I could only open it by clicking on the icon at the bottom left of the screen and once the inventory was open it obscured most of the middle of the picture, making it very awkward to hand anything to anyone or use an object in the backpack on anything in the room.</p><p>None of these idiosyncrasies presented an insurmountable problem but all put together they added up to a constant background of mild irritation. Compounded with the major frustration of being stuck in the first room, it was more than enough to make me want to quit, which I did.</p><p>I wouldn\'t write the game off for that, though. A walkthrough or even an in-game hint would have gotten me over the hump and the odd UI choices are something I\'d have become used to as I went along. The visuals are very appealing and the voice acting was more than decent. I\'ll give it another go if I find out how to get past the opening screen.&nbsp;</p><p><i><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Nova Antarctica</span></b></i></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMII3t0ivJAor2Er2BG_3aBLM5huPE-6lO8yzNSRwwb_jS-ZzzYH4j5Wx-_AB-_yWoBFwHOT2cFoDGhCj9XQkK_Dceh2fSuT3ryyo7UNoIlOVsz4ibCtcoT028fi4qFiHH_FqWpwavHbm73lDuEJbr2sguXwA-HAGmmACiCaUGWO5BaCt4dtJ3Wu53W40/s1920/narc1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMII3t0ivJAor2Er2BG_3aBLM5huPE-6lO8yzNSRwwb_jS-ZzzYH4j5Wx-_AB-_yWoBFwHOT2cFoDGhCj9XQkK_Dceh2fSuT3ryyo7UNoIlOVsz4ibCtcoT028fi4qFiHH_FqWpwavHbm73lDuEJbr2sguXwA-HAGmmACiCaUGWO5BaCt4dtJ3Wu53W40/w640-h360/narc1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />This demo felt much more polished, finished and complete than the other two. It ran flawlessly and everything was clearly explained. The game plays well and looks great.&nbsp;<p></p><p>I didn\'t enjoy it all that much, for two main reasons:</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>It\'s a true survival game</li><li>It\'s on a timer.</li></ol><p>Yes, I knew it was a survival game, going in. Yes, I have played quite a few survival games and enjoyed them. Even so, I wasn\'t ready for such a harsh, unforgiving experience.</p><p>At the start of the demo you arrive in the Antarctic by boat. According to the game\'s description, you\'re a child although, since the character is dressed in an all-over environment suit, complete with helmet, that looks exactly like a space-suit, you could be a gnome or a dwarf or anything less than four foot tall, it\'s impossible to tell.</p><p>The suit has a backpack life-support system powered by batteries. If the temperature drops below zero it uses power. (It\'s the Antarctic. It\'s <i>always </i>below zero.) If there\'s a blizzard, power use increases enormously (It\'s the Antarctic. There are <i>always </i>blizzards.)&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLrtDkoCSLoBlisQaP27V2-xIpNL_VdYtTgDexuEXoWU_4pTujIJ7sCMP5pSpOuvL8GVQpn_pc0LxB-D6H63Tbqi11U5sd1uvIuuztZ0jgJIiWVylgor8-49x9lpIaOvfh4rvjT8hekB-yc1t-2q2k3jXL27WCfKFnnfQ72uLtG6IF5YL-1evXtbO6A_o/s1920/narc2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLrtDkoCSLoBlisQaP27V2-xIpNL_VdYtTgDexuEXoWU_4pTujIJ7sCMP5pSpOuvL8GVQpn_pc0LxB-D6H63Tbqi11U5sd1uvIuuztZ0jgJIiWVylgor8-49x9lpIaOvfh4rvjT8hekB-yc1t-2q2k3jXL27WCfKFnnfQ72uLtG6IF5YL-1evXtbO6A_o/w640-h360/narc2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>You follow some glowing footprints. You pick up everything you find - wood, rocks, meal packs, plant life - as you pass by the remnants of previous expeditions, including the corpses. You can even activate holograms that give you some idea what happened to them.</p><p>At various points the game instructs you on how to craft useful items from the detritus you\'ve found. A crate, so you can clamber over obstacles. A new battery to replace the one that\'s just about to run out. A pick to mine ore. You find a penguin you can pick up and carry to give you additional body heat.</p><p>All of which is quite good fun. Until you die. Which you will.</p><p>On my first run, I failed to replace my battery fast enough. I froze to death in a blizzard. I had learned quite a bit, though, and I was sure I could do better.</p><p>I was right. I did much better. I got a lot further, saw a lot more, managed to replace the battery several times. I was just at the point when the game was telling me I ought to be making some kind of shelter when I died. My battery hadn\'t run out this time (Although it was damn close.) The timer had.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7YPhyphenhyphenlLimo8idOMfXqgValzw2kyeHmB_5G38xUlQYtfPDK1iGvzHeBrR5MFHZglh_yXIhHZQ3zCVuKhYTovyfF0PGOgTdoFYOxz9sLsMK3qGRxuchoMywGWuC0rp_AwF4j9_XvfoABtnrJo25Xw70E0vGFbPR2_y8rVP-GzKgCfPK_-JCBFI-yl-rSKE/s1920/narc3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7YPhyphenhyphenlLimo8idOMfXqgValzw2kyeHmB_5G38xUlQYtfPDK1iGvzHeBrR5MFHZglh_yXIhHZQ3zCVuKhYTovyfF0PGOgTdoFYOxz9sLsMK3qGRxuchoMywGWuC0rp_AwF4j9_XvfoABtnrJo25Xw70E0vGFbPR2_y8rVP-GzKgCfPK_-JCBFI-yl-rSKE/w640-h360/narc3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>You get fifteen minutes. Andy Warhol would love it. (Actually, he\'d hate it but anyone over about fifty is culturally obliged to name-check the great man whenever the words "<i>fifteen minutes</i>" are mentioned, regardless of context.)</p><p>Fifteen minutes is not long enough for a demo in my opinion. I\'d say you need twice that long to get the feel of most games and probably longer for anything in the survival genre. I\'m sure, having played survival games before, that gameplay gets easier the longer you last, or at least the survival aspects will fade into the background. All this does is highlight the extreme difficulty of getting started in a game like this, which is the part most people would probably prefer to forget.</p><p>Also, similarly to Atomic Age, the controls were non-standard. Again, not a major problem. I was already adapting to them even in the short time I played. I do often wish there was an industry standard for these things that developers would adhere to, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn\'t be at all surprised if Nova Antarctica turns out to be a good game. I just don\'t think you can tell all that much about it from the demo. I wouldn\'t say it was a particularly good demo although it\'s not <i>bad </i>in any obvious way.

Things went much faster than I was expecting, although not for the reason I might have wished. I didn\'t really get into it and spend a lot longer playing than I thought I would. Just the opposite, in fact, as we\'re about to find out.<p></p><p>Here are the four demos I\'ve played so far, in descending order by how long Steam tells me I spent playing each of them:</p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Dissimilar</span></i> - 59 minutes&nbsp;</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Nova Antarctica</span></i> - 31 minutes</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Atomic Age</span></i> - 23 minutes</b></p><p><b><i><span style="font-size: large;">Magic World</span></i> - 5 minutes</b></p><p>Let me break those timings down a little.&nbsp;</p><p>I haven\'t finished playing the <i>Dissimilar </i>demo. I stopped at a convenient point because it was getting late. I was having a pretty good time with it and the only reason I haven\'t gone back to finish it is because I thought I ought to get some of the others out of the way first.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, I\'ve played the whole of the <i>Nova Antarctica</i> demo twice. It has a fifteen-minute lockout.</p><p>The <i>Atomic Ag</i>e demo might last any amount of time. I wouldn\'t know. I got stuck in the very first location and decided enough was enough.</p><p>And the <i>Magic World</i> demo turned out not to be a demo of the game at all.</p><p>Now the reviews. I\'ll take them in reverse order, saving the best for last.&nbsp;</p><p><i><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Magic World </b></span></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is a demo for a game that supposed to be an open world MMORPG. Maybe it will be, one day. I wouldn\'t put my money on it. Certainly no-one, not even the developers, are claiming its an MMORPG yet.</p><p>The first thing you see when you hit Play is this warning:</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjAWIDnuKmTgky8wgnrZCLlR9ojA_LI_xeUymUYl72sB6yr-nTXrKOLUO0iDUq2OWLX8Iwfx6dHEqVeHFhwLySW6-gXGwZskPEMnbgQUrfhwkeuz-iag-wx511GcAxknxbRixJY4m608q6UnpGHPJNwIjxpkY29IQGnPvteU5DpMAmWVDXWF_48njgoDk/s1241/mwdemo1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="244" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjAWIDnuKmTgky8wgnrZCLlR9ojA_LI_xeUymUYl72sB6yr-nTXrKOLUO0iDUq2OWLX8Iwfx6dHEqVeHFhwLySW6-gXGwZskPEMnbgQUrfhwkeuz-iag-wx511GcAxknxbRixJY4m608q6UnpGHPJNwIjxpkY29IQGnPvteU5DpMAmWVDXWF_48njgoDk/w640-h244/mwdemo1.png" width="640" /></a></div>At best, it\'s a tech demo, although even that\'s pushing it. It\'s a very basic draft of the proposed magic system as it relates to combat. There\'s a short tutorial, using placeholder graphics, in which you move through a series of featureless corridors and open spaces, following instructions on how to move your mouse and press keys to fire spells at an opponent or protect yourself from attacks. There are also options to duel other players and fight NPC opponents, neither of which I felt the slightest inclination to do.<p></p><p>Steam tells me it took five minutes to get to the end of the tutorial but it felt a lot longer than that. I never expected to enjoy the gimmick of moving my mouse while pressing a key in order to cast a spell but this was even less fun than I thought it would be. No fun at all, in fact.</p><p>I can easily imagine a VR game, where you have to wave a wand around to cast spells, being both exciting and immersive but this is neither. The idea of simulating somatic gestures by moving your mouse left and right or up and down seems doomed to failure form the start. Who would find that more enjoyable than any of many variations on action combat we have already?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhT0li4geRjg_nG3toOLCKQ__5JtqjXDrkKKOwRUwsSZQSWZ299zBgUEecths-cDYsVKUAlem4rzPid90pks8VtzEPq0kzqeGr03agOQdv8hyphenhyphenCRw7OtfUOrQi2tuTtH2yIzb-wosqbCZtJOC4VvyuPvgaldUsD2oN0Nrhr_nWd5RH7F8YbWEc28xHYJbo/s1920/mw3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhT0li4geRjg_nG3toOLCKQ__5JtqjXDrkKKOwRUwsSZQSWZ299zBgUEecths-cDYsVKUAlem4rzPid90pks8VtzEPq0kzqeGr03agOQdv8hyphenhyphenCRw7OtfUOrQi2tuTtH2yIzb-wosqbCZtJOC4VvyuPvgaldUsD2oN0Nrhr_nWd5RH7F8YbWEc28xHYJbo/w640-h360/mw3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Not me, that\'s for sure. As for the demo not including anything that makes the game an MMORPG, I think it\'s perfectly reasonable for the devs to put up a tech demo and ask for feedback. I just don\'t want to be the one playing it. Looking at the game\'s store page, it does explain that\'s what it is (Kind of...). I didn\'t see that when I chose it and if I had I would never have downloaded it. I don\'t think it was made clear in the Next Fest entry but I might just have missed it.</p><p>Also, to answer a question that came up in the comments last time, the store page clarifies that the images they\'re currently using to promote it <i>are </i>indeed generated by AI but they promise no AI content will be used in the game itself. Judging by what\'s available so far, I would imagine by the time the actual game arrives, AI will be so embedded in game development generally, no-one will care any more.</p><p><b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Atomic Age</i></span></b></p><p><b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i></i></span></b></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5m-RNqzTC5Ut786esSyOgbspLUXuAR3wYCEPV2slI5aGBTZ6sWfSpg_-thVc-F6oJ4eJhloC4CdPEfJy5iV67HDcxBr3zSh93EFLSnYyNVcfcZb0vLt7skHfdaf8bHnHuNJbrZL1r4qYuP2L-KaS9dT2zuBgl26K3vFbJ5dmGBtWI7XTG9ws03Hq8MqU/s1924/aa2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="354" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5m-RNqzTC5Ut786esSyOgbspLUXuAR3wYCEPV2slI5aGBTZ6sWfSpg_-thVc-F6oJ4eJhloC4CdPEfJy5iV67HDcxBr3zSh93EFLSnYyNVcfcZb0vLt7skHfdaf8bHnHuNJbrZL1r4qYuP2L-KaS9dT2zuBgl26K3vFbJ5dmGBtWI7XTG9ws03Hq8MqU/w640-h354/aa2.jpg" width="640" /></a></i></span></b></div><b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i><br /></i></span></b>This one looked every bit as good as I hoped it would. Well, it did in the one location I ever got to see...&nbsp;<p></p><p>It begins with the main character addressing the player directly, telling you who he is and what he does as he sets up the premise for the game. The dialog is solid enough and the voice actor does a good job putting it across. I was feeling like this might go well.</p><p>Then there came a couple of opportunities for me, the player, to ask questions in the traditional "<i>Pick one response from three</i>" mode and those started to give me some concerns. All three options felt a little off, somehow. They didn\'t feel like they\'d been written by the same person who\'d done the dialog. They had a different tone altogether, one I didn\'t much take to.</p><p>That discomfiting dissonance continued once the introduction ended and the game itself began. There was some conversation between the character I was playing and the mustachioed gentleman I\'d come to see for an interview. None of it felt quite right. Then the gent and his female companion left, locking the door behind them and leaving me trapped in the room</p><p>Side-stepping the issue of how wildly unrealistic this is (Have <i>you </i>ever been for an interview that ended with the interviewer, accidentally-or-otherwise, locking you in the interview room?) the real problem was that I couldn\'t get out. I\'m used to adventure game logic, where I end up trying every interactable object with every other interactable object until some entirely ridiculous combination does the trick although usually I don\'t have the patience for trial and error and just look it up.</p><p>This time, there were few enough objects that it seemed quite feasible to try every combination. The problem was none of them worked.</p><p>I opened the cupboard and took the rope. I found the Personal Assistant robot in the bin full of spare parts. I found the Operating Manual on the shelf. I attached the rope to the fruit machine that dispenses batteries as prizes. (Best not ask too many questions about that.) I got a battery, which I put into the PA to get it working.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-DPjSqQnLE9uLtq323EmWhDQg1wsh5Y0BmeV5aIAjIYK9Xj8srjaP_AIyTqZU_3nKt9Ljn0oU1C0pDlW62Jsb4EbFAcz7zB6PctrwR4VvW8T5w_48yIJexQRcWN1bK0dPAhoOZBC-rkm2wDRhfNFb9_Gm8eh-NvdAh1ezL-GJR9Ct9nWcICcmzjUk2V4/s1924/aa3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="354" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-DPjSqQnLE9uLtq323EmWhDQg1wsh5Y0BmeV5aIAjIYK9Xj8srjaP_AIyTqZU_3nKt9Ljn0oU1C0pDlW62Jsb4EbFAcz7zB6PctrwR4VvW8T5w_48yIJexQRcWN1bK0dPAhoOZBC-rkm2wDRhfNFb9_Gm8eh-NvdAh1ezL-GJR9Ct9nWcICcmzjUk2V4/w640-h354/aa3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>And then I was stumped. Those were all the usable items I could find apart from a gramophone and the door. Using the gramophone caused a drawer at the bottom to open and close and that was all. No item would interact with it, open or closed. Nothing would interact with the door. None of the items worked on or with each other.</p><p>I googled for a walkthrough but it seems no-one has bothered to write one. Or even complain about being stuck. At which point, I decided I had better things to do with my time and called it a day.</p><p>Apart from the unplayabilty of it all, I found the controls annoying. In most point&amp;click adventures, you <i>Examine </i>with RMB and <i>Use </i>with LMB. This one does the opposite. Either I or B usually opens your inventory. Here, neither does. I could only open it by clicking on the icon at the bottom left of the screen and once the inventory was open it obscured most of the middle of the picture, making it very awkward to hand anything to anyone or use an object in the backpack on anything in the room.</p><p>None of these idiosyncrasies presented an insurmountable problem but all put together they added up to a constant background of mild irritation. Compounded with the major frustration of being stuck in the first room, it was more than enough to make me want to quit, which I did.</p><p>I wouldn\'t write the game off for that, though. A walkthrough or even an in-game hint would have gotten me over the hump and the odd UI choices are something I\'d have become used to as I went along. The visuals are very appealing and the voice acting was more than decent. I\'ll give it another go if I find out how to get past the opening screen.&nbsp;</p><p><i><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Nova Antarctica</span></b></i></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMII3t0ivJAor2Er2BG_3aBLM5huPE-6lO8yzNSRwwb_jS-ZzzYH4j5Wx-_AB-_yWoBFwHOT2cFoDGhCj9XQkK_Dceh2fSuT3ryyo7UNoIlOVsz4ibCtcoT028fi4qFiHH_FqWpwavHbm73lDuEJbr2sguXwA-HAGmmACiCaUGWO5BaCt4dtJ3Wu53W40/s1920/narc1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMII3t0ivJAor2Er2BG_3aBLM5huPE-6lO8yzNSRwwb_jS-ZzzYH4j5Wx-_AB-_yWoBFwHOT2cFoDGhCj9XQkK_Dceh2fSuT3ryyo7UNoIlOVsz4ibCtcoT028fi4qFiHH_FqWpwavHbm73lDuEJbr2sguXwA-HAGmmACiCaUGWO5BaCt4dtJ3Wu53W40/w640-h360/narc1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />This demo felt much more polished, finished and complete than the other two. It ran flawlessly and everything was clearly explained. The game plays well and looks great.&nbsp;<p></p><p>I didn\'t enjoy it all that much, for two main reasons:</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>It\'s a true survival game</li><li>It\'s on a timer.</li></ol><p>Yes, I knew it was a survival game, going in. Yes, I have played quite a few survival games and enjoyed them. Even so, I wasn\'t ready for such a harsh, unforgiving experience.</p><p>At the start of the demo you arrive in the Antarctic by boat. According to the game\'s description, you\'re a child although, since the character is dressed in an all-over environment suit, complete with helmet, that looks exactly like a space-suit, you could be a gnome or a dwarf or anything less than four foot tall, it\'s impossible to tell.</p><p>The suit has a backpack life-support system powered by batteries. If the temperature drops below zero it uses power. (It\'s the Antarctic. It\'s <i>always </i>below zero.) If there\'s a blizzard, power use increases enormously (It\'s the Antarctic. There are <i>always </i>blizzards.)&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLrtDkoCSLoBlisQaP27V2-xIpNL_VdYtTgDexuEXoWU_4pTujIJ7sCMP5pSpOuvL8GVQpn_pc0LxB-D6H63Tbqi11U5sd1uvIuuztZ0jgJIiWVylgor8-49x9lpIaOvfh4rvjT8hekB-yc1t-2q2k3jXL27WCfKFnnfQ72uLtG6IF5YL-1evXtbO6A_o/s1920/narc2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLrtDkoCSLoBlisQaP27V2-xIpNL_VdYtTgDexuEXoWU_4pTujIJ7sCMP5pSpOuvL8GVQpn_pc0LxB-D6H63Tbqi11U5sd1uvIuuztZ0jgJIiWVylgor8-49x9lpIaOvfh4rvjT8hekB-yc1t-2q2k3jXL27WCfKFnnfQ72uLtG6IF5YL-1evXtbO6A_o/w640-h360/narc2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>You follow some glowing footprints. You pick up everything you find - wood, rocks, meal packs, plant life - as you pass by the remnants of previous expeditions, including the corpses. You can even activate holograms that give you some idea what happened to them.</p><p>At various points the game instructs you on how to craft useful items from the detritus you\'ve found. A crate, so you can clamber over obstacles. A new battery to replace the one that\'s just about to run out. A pick to mine ore. You find a penguin you can pick up and carry to give you additional body heat.</p><p>All of which is quite good fun. Until you die. Which you will.</p><p>On my first run, I failed to replace my battery fast enough. I froze to death in a blizzard. I had learned quite a bit, though, and I was sure I could do better.</p><p>I was right. I did much better. I got a lot further, saw a lot more, managed to replace the battery several times. I was just at the point when the game was telling me I ought to be making some kind of shelter when I died. My battery hadn\'t run out this time (Although it was damn close.)

Andy Warhol would love it. (Actually, he\'d hate it but anyone over about fifty is culturally obliged to name-check the great man whenever the words "<i>fifteen minutes</i>" are mentioned, regardless of context.)</p><p>Fifteen minutes is not long enough for a demo in my opinion. I\'d say you need twice that long to get the feel of most games and probably longer for anything in the survival genre. I\'m sure, having played survival games before, that gameplay gets easier the longer you last, or at least the survival aspects will fade into the background. All this does is highlight the extreme difficulty of getting started in a game like this, which is the part most people would probably prefer to forget.</p><p>Also, similarly to Atomic Age, the controls were non-standard. Again, not a major problem. I was already adapting to them even in the short time I played. I do often wish there was an industry standard for these things that developers would adhere to, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn\'t be at all surprised if Nova Antarctica turns out to be a good game.

The visuals did\n  contribute a lot to my choices as they always do but there\'s no point trying\n  to play a great-looking game in a genre for which you have no affinity, so\n  even the greatest pictures have to take second place to the gameplay. This\n  one\'s "<i>A futuristic, humorous, slapstick based point &amp; click adventure in the\n    shape of the 50th and 60th years.</i>" All of that sounds right up my street except maybe the slapstick.

Confusingly, <a href="https://www.mmorpg.com/magic-world-online"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">not the first</span></a> to call itself "<i>Magic World</i>", either. There were several MMOs in this Next Fest but this is the only one I went for and I\'m not\n  confident about it at all but the rest looked even less likely to be fun and I felt I really ought to try at least one of them. This one has a fairly\n  traditional setting: "<i>Expansive Open World – Explore mysterious lands, ancient ruins, hidden\n    treasures, and battle dangerous creatures.</i>" Unfortunately, the devs also appear to want to re-invent the wheel by\n  replacing all the tried and tested methods of combat with one that has you "<i>drawing magical symbols with your mouse and combining them with key presses\n    to unleash devastating abilities.</i>" I have seen this tried before and it was not a success. Also, I don\'t have\n  room on my desk for drawing symbols with the mouse...\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Dissimilar</span></b><br />\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I have a lot more faith in this one. It\'s "<i>A unique blend of mystery, turn-based combat, and exploration</i>" with gorgeous, hand-drawn art. I\'m always looking for games with the kind\n  of turn-based combat I so much enjoyed in the <i>Dungeon of Naheulbeuk</i> but\n  they\'re very hard to find. This isn\'t exactly the same but it looks like it\n  might have a similar feel. And even if it doesn\'t, the detection and\n  exploration looks like it\'ll be fun.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">A Tale Of Dirty Whiskers</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaZFGkWPW75Z1A3zXXv9EHfJ8stxLia6xOo0mpdIykY4Ci_v6DG1-W-_EhWHh8I32bWEVC3ZmmqXtLWwSpPfjr71Lv_4D3ulQx21AmGy82-CzXwU7Qrdd2jwWoMSZ-0Ok33qxQybkNYN8SdNlJ8sOXWR2stSH2wrHuJPRGfSKnBsSfP151SAmDCb68fMQ/s1251/cw1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaZFGkWPW75Z1A3zXXv9EHfJ8stxLia6xOo0mpdIykY4Ci_v6DG1-W-_EhWHh8I32bWEVC3ZmmqXtLWwSpPfjr71Lv_4D3ulQx21AmGy82-CzXwU7Qrdd2jwWoMSZ-0Ok33qxQybkNYN8SdNlJ8sOXWR2stSH2wrHuJPRGfSKnBsSfP151SAmDCb68fMQ/w640-h358/cw1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  There are always loads of demos featuring cats in every Next Fest, aren\'t\n  there? Anyone would think there was some connection between owning a cat and\n  playing video games. Hard to imagine. It was the feline factor that drew this\n  to my attention but the main reason I picked it was that the demo seems to be\n  in Spanish. Not the text, which is definitely English, but the voice acting. I\n  don\'t speak Spanish but I know enough to pick out a few words and I was\n  wondering if playing a whole game where the translation of what I\'m hearing is\n  right there in front of me might work like some half-assed kind of language course. <i>And </i>it\'s another point&amp;click murder mystery, so there\'s\n  that...\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Aether and Iron</span></b><br />\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Not exactly leaving the best to last but quite possibly the\n  best-looking.&nbsp;Gameplay-wise, it\'s a "<i>decopunk Narrative RPG set in an alternate 1930s</i>" with turn-based combat between flying cars, which sounds amazing and&nbsp;looking at the raves\n  from the likes of PCGamer (<i>“This tactics RPG set on a floating New York City could be the next great\n    noir videogame.”</i>) I guess it might turn out to be the best after all. Here are a couple more\n  tantalizing comparisons:\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>“Aether and Iron Is Like Disco Elysium, Citizen Sleeper, and BioShock All\n    at Once” -&nbsp;GameRant</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>“Aether and Iron has lashings of Bioshock and Baldur’s Gate 3...” -\n    PCGamesN&nbsp;</i>\n</p>\n<p>That\'s some heavy praise.

Confusingly, <a href="https://www.mmorpg.com/magic-world-online"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">not the first</span></a> to call itself "<i>Magic World</i>", either. There were several MMOs in this Next Fest but this is the only one I went for and I\'m not\n  confident about it at all but the rest looked even less likely to be fun and I felt I really ought to try at least one of them. This one has a fairly\n  traditional setting: "<i>Expansive Open World – Explore mysterious lands, ancient ruins, hidden\n    treasures, and battle dangerous creatures.</i>" Unfortunately, the devs also appear to want to re-invent the wheel by\n  replacing all the tried and tested methods of combat with one that has you "<i>drawing magical symbols with your mouse and combining them with key presses\n    to unleash devastating abilities.</i>" I have seen this tried before and it was not a success.

It\'s "<i>A unique blend of mystery, turn-based combat, and exploration</i>" with gorgeous, hand-drawn art. I\'m always looking for games with the kind\n  of turn-based combat I so much enjoyed in the <i>Dungeon of Naheulbeuk</i> but\n  they\'re very hard to find. This isn\'t exactly the same but it looks like it\n  might have a similar feel. And even if it doesn\'t, the detection and\n  exploration looks like it\'ll be fun.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">A Tale Of Dirty Whiskers</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaZFGkWPW75Z1A3zXXv9EHfJ8stxLia6xOo0mpdIykY4Ci_v6DG1-W-_EhWHh8I32bWEVC3ZmmqXtLWwSpPfjr71Lv_4D3ulQx21AmGy82-CzXwU7Qrdd2jwWoMSZ-0Ok33qxQybkNYN8SdNlJ8sOXWR2stSH2wrHuJPRGfSKnBsSfP151SAmDCb68fMQ/s1251/cw1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaZFGkWPW75Z1A3zXXv9EHfJ8stxLia6xOo0mpdIykY4Ci_v6DG1-W-_EhWHh8I32bWEVC3ZmmqXtLWwSpPfjr71Lv_4D3ulQx21AmGy82-CzXwU7Qrdd2jwWoMSZ-0Ok33qxQybkNYN8SdNlJ8sOXWR2stSH2wrHuJPRGfSKnBsSfP151SAmDCb68fMQ/w640-h358/cw1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  There are always loads of demos featuring cats in every Next Fest, aren\'t\n  there?

Unfotunately, in making that plan I hadn\'t allowed for the fact that it doesn\'t kick off until 10AM PAcific, which is six o\'clock in the evening here. That wouldn\'t be too late for me to pick and post but it would turn the whole thing into a bit of a race so I\'m going to leave it for tomorrow.<p></p><p>All of which means it\'s yet another First impressions post for <i>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</i>. Yay!</p><p>I guess at some point First Impressions have to give way to plain old Impressions. I think we might be getting close to that point now. I\'ve racked up just short of five hours, which is nothing for an MMORPG, but I\'m level 26 and I\'ve finished the first chapter of the main story quest so it feels as though I\'m well into the game.</p><p>And so far I\'m really enjoying it. I realised yesterday why I\'ve seen several reviews comparing it to<i> Final Fantasy XIV</i>.&nbsp; I though at first it was just that it\'s an MMO and that happened to be the one those reviewers knew best because certainly <i>BP:SR</i> doesn\'t seem to play much like the <i>FFXIV </i>I remember. Then, as I was trotting around <i>Asterleeds</i>, the main city, I started to notice how similar the architecture is to some of the locations I vaguely remember from that game.</p><p>It\'s been a long time since I saw any of the cities of <i>Eorzea </i>so I\'m vague on which, if any, Asterleeds might specifically ressemble. It\'s more the look and feel, all that wood paneling, the way the NPCs stand behind counters, the wide streets... True, lots of cities in lots of MMOs have a similar design aesthetic but I can\'t say any of them have reminded me of FFXIV quite as much as this.</p><p>There\'s also the catalog of creatures to kill, something I recall playing a significant part in FFXIV but again, lots of games have something similar. If there are any more specific similarities, I imagine you\'d need to be more tuned in to <i>Square Enix</i>\'s game than I am to spot them. Still, it\'s a factor for some people, clearly.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiK6PIW2i8LDi2eDn8ahpUaUYgoLKXxcWNl5HQ0rOpCPKclp3CN5_6UAc5-iFz6Kx0YNR2AA-1AEKTmFfzuFpOQtfAWWZvSLaidrV_EjT9-h8asSzfOFjHc49NTJpP8d0H5ZqiZt4_HwS2DYmUxO-e3mdWV6viOCS2Bd3cYnerk_LO6W8cUigV_fuJYmd4/s1620/bpfw1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="394" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiK6PIW2i8LDi2eDn8ahpUaUYgoLKXxcWNl5HQ0rOpCPKclp3CN5_6UAc5-iFz6Kx0YNR2AA-1AEKTmFfzuFpOQtfAWWZvSLaidrV_EjT9-h8asSzfOFjHc49NTJpP8d0H5ZqiZt4_HwS2DYmUxO-e3mdWV6viOCS2Bd3cYnerk_LO6W8cUigV_fuJYmd4/w640-h394/bpfw1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div><br /><p></p><br /><br />One thing BP:SR doesn\'t seem to do all that well is introduce players to new features and systems as they come up. It\'s not that it doesn\'t do it at all, more that it tends to mention them and move on quite quickly to something else. <p>Arguably, that\'s a positive rather than a negative. The usual tendency for modern games is to keep banging on about things until you never want to hear about them ever again. This way, it\'s left up to the player to do something with the information, which at least suggests some agency.</p><p>For example, I\'m pretty sure there was a suggestion at some point that I go speak to some NPC about crafting. It wasn\'t put as obviously as that and I didn\'t do anything about it but later, as I was going through some icons and menus to see what was there, I came across a whole page of Life Skills, all with details of who to speak to to get started.</p><p>That led me to check my Quest Journal for the first time, where I found I had no fewer than sixteen pending quests, only two of which I remembered acquiring. There\'s a quest tracker but it only seems to highlight a couple of quests at a time.</p><p>Most of this is my fault, not the game\'s. For a few years now, I seem to have slipped into the habit of pursuing the MSQ or core storyline in every new game I try, very much to the detriment of the game as a whole. It\'s not something I ever used to do and I\'m not really sure when or why I changed my behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>I suspect it\'s simply because most modern MMORPGs and open-world RPGs have strong central storylines and put them in front of you from the get-go. If you don\'t actively choose to step off the moving walkway, it will carry you through the content it wants you to be consuming without giving you much choice.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFCk94bExK7eGdsjpFFD1sytbZi9JRnZkfo5y_fHHGTJkmO5g8N_JQpbYUBUvHTnug_SZyQPyBAZVsNNzWJDW6t3Tc7HwGDQwZk-U0FC9CZ7AFWw57yrMoJ45Mbbmz9AwaASkLByNfUmLylQ2r-A38EYeibPVt5X-g47kDsqv9P3oAd01NrbD_LUo3G7E/s1920/bpls2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFCk94bExK7eGdsjpFFD1sytbZi9JRnZkfo5y_fHHGTJkmO5g8N_JQpbYUBUvHTnug_SZyQPyBAZVsNNzWJDW6t3Tc7HwGDQwZk-U0FC9CZ7AFWw57yrMoJ45Mbbmz9AwaASkLByNfUmLylQ2r-A38EYeibPVt5X-g47kDsqv9P3oAd01NrbD_LUo3G7E/w640-h360/bpls2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>It\'s probably one reason why there\'s a perception that these kinds of games don\'t have as much going on in them as they once did. As you complete chapter after chapter of the big storyline, there\'s an inevitable sense that you\'re making your way along a linear path, exactly like watching a movie or reading a book. When you get to the credits or turn the final page, it feels like the game is over.</p><p>That\'s possibly also why side quests seem to be so looked down upon these days. It\'s quite common to hear people complaining about them in the way they complain about trash mobs. There are too many; it\'s boring to have to go through them; why can\'t it all just be the MSQ?</p><p>If you go back far enough, there didn\'t used to be such a harsh definition, either of quests or mobs. Without a dominant central questline, quests were more likely to seem interesting or worthwhile in their own right, either for the smaller stories they told, or for the xp or rewards they gave. Mobs, similarly, were more likely to have drops you might want or to give xp you might need, so it didn\'t seem like such an imposition to have to kill them on the way to doing other things.</p><p>I\'ve always thought the increased focus on story and on a central, obligatory MSQ was as much a problem as a solution. Yes, it keeps players both engaged and occupied but it also fosters the idea that once you\'re done with the story, you\'re done with the game. All that\'s left after that is a so-called end-game that\'s inevitably and unavoidably repetitive. For all the complaints about the "<i>grind</i>" of leveling in old-school MMORPGs , it\'s hard to see the current version as very much of an improvement. Or even all that different.</p><p>This, I\'m uncomfortably aware, is the hole I\'ve lowered myself into in <i>Wuthering Waves</i>. That game has a wealth of very satisfying and engaging content beyond the excellent MSQ and when I first started playing it I was having a fine old time exploring it all. At some point, though, I locked myself into the central storyline and the rest of the fascinating world disappeared behind a screen of (Admittedly first-rate.) cut scenes and set pieces.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPrO2_6Mk0mF3OKBxBM2yK3GsNl1tiOKVQ2cORgUef77YQ2c9sTM7sKwq6o8LuErwKbs7T57GyHe4-caguO7QsU7gJlVjJTU0z8OBI4CHtJDNRuaCxC-F0YCKQdFl3p8CUQ6tUkwHFUHg2BMxv1fSGE3ZN2PlFUm58PrRQB9jPuc6Xysn7RpT52Q0cXBQ/s1920/bpfish1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPrO2_6Mk0mF3OKBxBM2yK3GsNl1tiOKVQ2cORgUef77YQ2c9sTM7sKwq6o8LuErwKbs7T57GyHe4-caguO7QsU7gJlVjJTU0z8OBI4CHtJDNRuaCxC-F0YCKQdFl3p8CUQ6tUkwHFUHg2BMxv1fSGE3ZN2PlFUm58PrRQB9jPuc6Xysn7RpT52Q0cXBQ/w640-h360/bpfish1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>BP:SR is never going to have the same inherent literary or aesthetic value as the exceptional WW but the story running through the middle of it is still interesting enough to hold my attention and the game constantly nudges me to keep on with it to the exclusion of all else. Those nudges, though, are gentler and less persistent than in most games and that\'s why I\'m here now, considering my options.</p><p>When I play again later today, I think I\'m going to open up my Journal and start working through a few of those quests I seem to have picked up without even noticing. Maybe they\'ll be filler I wish I\'d skipped or maybe they\'ll be satisfying vignettes that shed light on the world <i>Floradelle </i>finds herself living in. Mostly, I suspect, they\'ll introduce me to aspects of the game I ought to know about.</p><p>One of them, for instance, introduces Fishing, which appears to be something entirely separate from Life Skills. There\'s another similarity with FFXIV.&nbsp; At least Fishing is always pretty straightforward. You know where you are with a fish.</p><p>Life Skills or Crafts are always a problem. In some games they\'re barely more than amusements and it makes no real difference which you pick but in others choosing the wrong one can be almost game-breaking. I\'ve never known any game give sufficient information up front to make that choice a truly informed one. It\'s always outside sources that tell you Class A <i>must </i>take Craft B and Craft B <i>needs</i> Secondary Craft C.</p><p>All of which means I\'ve already reached the point where I ought to do some research outside the game before I make any final decisions. Luckily, BP:SR is one of those games where there\'s plenty of advice available.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpwxvIJJFoLCpWu8XVwbEG66t6YyBD9MA5BDPJTPZ7sHjavscKON-BV5aK2QVBQT6Y0bL5hHeT9JxVD6wwWGKV0LZ81aRXoqm39D9jFHKhbl2JfXQg3Mo4A4XT-SrslofXsUID_xLhpcd_lna3oXcPALX01Us39VB8xCIGebhblUaBk3OIqwmL6cdJ3Ho/s1920/bpls1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpwxvIJJFoLCpWu8XVwbEG66t6YyBD9MA5BDPJTPZ7sHjavscKON-BV5aK2QVBQT6Y0bL5hHeT9JxVD6wwWGKV0LZ81aRXoqm39D9jFHKhbl2JfXQg3Mo4A4XT-SrslofXsUID_xLhpcd_lna3oXcPALX01Us39VB8xCIGebhblUaBk3OIqwmL6cdJ3Ho/w640-h360/bpls1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Here\'s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/blue-protocol/resources/life-skills-system-guide"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">an overview</span></a> of Life Skills. You\'ll note it says right at the start that they\'re "<i>a core part</i>" of the game, "<i>important for progressing your character</i>". Not just fluff for fun, then. <a href="https://maxroll.gg/blue-protocol/resources/weaving-guide"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">A detailed guide</span></a> to one of them, Weaving, makes it clear why that is: "<i>Weaving allows you to craft Epic and Legendary quality Intellect and Agility Helmets, Armor, Gauntlets, and Boots for the Verdant Oracle, Beat Performer, Frost Mage, Stormblade, and Marksman classes, as well as Strength, Intellect, and Agility Charms.</i>"</p><p>That does sound like it would be important. Fortunately, as <i>Icy Veins</i> <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/other-games/news/mastering-life-skills-in-blue-protocol-star-resonance/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">explains</span></a>, "<i>You’re not locked into just one or two professions. You can pick up as many Life Skills as you want</i>". The real limitation here is something called <i>Focus</i>, one of those infamous time-gated resources.&nbsp;</p><p>I think I prefer being able to learn all the crafts but not always having the energy to do them to always having enough puff but being locked into specific skills. I suppose being able to take them all and never having any limitations on their use would be the ideal but even that would present problems of its own in terms of the investment and commitment required to take advantage of that degree of freedom.</p><p>There\'s probably no perfect solution. So long as whatever\'s there seems fair within its context, it ought to be acceptable. Based on previous experiences in similar games, in my case, it\'s highly unlikely I\'ll ever do enough crafting to run up against the timegates, so from my perspective it will probably seem like I have complete freedom anyway.</p><p>Unless I really get into the housing, that is. Oh yes, there\'s housing! And you can craft furniture.

Unfotunately, in making that plan I hadn\'t allowed for the fact that it doesn\'t kick off until 10AM PAcific, which is six o\'clock in the evening here. That wouldn\'t be too late for me to pick and post but it would turn the whole thing into a bit of a race so I\'m going to leave it for tomorrow.<p></p><p>All of which means it\'s yet another First impressions post for <i>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</i>. Yay!</p><p>I guess at some point First Impressions have to give way to plain old Impressions. I think we might be getting close to that point now. I\'ve racked up just short of five hours, which is nothing for an MMORPG, but I\'m level 26 and I\'ve finished the first chapter of the main story quest so it feels as though I\'m well into the game.</p><p>And so far I\'m really enjoying it. I realised yesterday why I\'ve seen several reviews comparing it to<i> Final Fantasy XIV</i>.&nbsp; I though at first it was just that it\'s an MMO and that happened to be the one those reviewers knew best because certainly <i>BP:SR</i> doesn\'t seem to play much like the <i>FFXIV </i>I remember. Then, as I was trotting around <i>Asterleeds</i>, the main city, I started to notice how similar the architecture is to some of the locations I vaguely remember from that game.</p><p>It\'s been a long time since I saw any of the cities of <i>Eorzea </i>so I\'m vague on which, if any, Asterleeds might specifically ressemble. It\'s more the look and feel, all that wood paneling, the way the NPCs stand behind counters, the wide streets... True, lots of cities in lots of MMOs have a similar design aesthetic but I can\'t say any of them have reminded me of FFXIV quite as much as this.</p><p>There\'s also the catalog of creatures to kill, something I recall playing a significant part in FFXIV but again, lots of games have something similar. If there are any more specific similarities, I imagine you\'d need to be more tuned in to <i>Square Enix</i>\'s game than I am to spot them. Still, it\'s a factor for some people, clearly.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiK6PIW2i8LDi2eDn8ahpUaUYgoLKXxcWNl5HQ0rOpCPKclp3CN5_6UAc5-iFz6Kx0YNR2AA-1AEKTmFfzuFpOQtfAWWZvSLaidrV_EjT9-h8asSzfOFjHc49NTJpP8d0H5ZqiZt4_HwS2DYmUxO-e3mdWV6viOCS2Bd3cYnerk_LO6W8cUigV_fuJYmd4/s1620/bpfw1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="394" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiK6PIW2i8LDi2eDn8ahpUaUYgoLKXxcWNl5HQ0rOpCPKclp3CN5_6UAc5-iFz6Kx0YNR2AA-1AEKTmFfzuFpOQtfAWWZvSLaidrV_EjT9-h8asSzfOFjHc49NTJpP8d0H5ZqiZt4_HwS2DYmUxO-e3mdWV6viOCS2Bd3cYnerk_LO6W8cUigV_fuJYmd4/w640-h394/bpfw1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div><br /><p></p><br /><br />One thing BP:SR doesn\'t seem to do all that well is introduce players to new features and systems as they come up. It\'s not that it doesn\'t do it at all, more that it tends to mention them and move on quite quickly to something else. <p>Arguably, that\'s a positive rather than a negative. The usual tendency for modern games is to keep banging on about things until you never want to hear about them ever again. This way, it\'s left up to the player to do something with the information, which at least suggests some agency.</p><p>For example, I\'m pretty sure there was a suggestion at some point that I go speak to some NPC about crafting. It wasn\'t put as obviously as that and I didn\'t do anything about it but later, as I was going through some icons and menus to see what was there, I came across a whole page of Life Skills, all with details of who to speak to to get started.</p><p>That led me to check my Quest Journal for the first time, where I found I had no fewer than sixteen pending quests, only two of which I remembered acquiring. There\'s a quest tracker but it only seems to highlight a couple of quests at a time.</p><p>Most of this is my fault, not the game\'s. For a few years now, I seem to have slipped into the habit of pursuing the MSQ or core storyline in every new game I try, very much to the detriment of the game as a whole. It\'s not something I ever used to do and I\'m not really sure when or why I changed my behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>I suspect it\'s simply because most modern MMORPGs and open-world RPGs have strong central storylines and put them in front of you from the get-go. If you don\'t actively choose to step off the moving walkway, it will carry you through the content it wants you to be consuming without giving you much choice.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFCk94bExK7eGdsjpFFD1sytbZi9JRnZkfo5y_fHHGTJkmO5g8N_JQpbYUBUvHTnug_SZyQPyBAZVsNNzWJDW6t3Tc7HwGDQwZk-U0FC9CZ7AFWw57yrMoJ45Mbbmz9AwaASkLByNfUmLylQ2r-A38EYeibPVt5X-g47kDsqv9P3oAd01NrbD_LUo3G7E/s1920/bpls2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFCk94bExK7eGdsjpFFD1sytbZi9JRnZkfo5y_fHHGTJkmO5g8N_JQpbYUBUvHTnug_SZyQPyBAZVsNNzWJDW6t3Tc7HwGDQwZk-U0FC9CZ7AFWw57yrMoJ45Mbbmz9AwaASkLByNfUmLylQ2r-A38EYeibPVt5X-g47kDsqv9P3oAd01NrbD_LUo3G7E/w640-h360/bpls2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>It\'s probably one reason why there\'s a perception that these kinds of games don\'t have as much going on in them as they once did. As you complete chapter after chapter of the big storyline, there\'s an inevitable sense that you\'re making your way along a linear path, exactly like watching a movie or reading a book. When you get to the credits or turn the final page, it feels like the game is over.</p><p>That\'s possibly also why side quests seem to be so looked down upon these days. It\'s quite common to hear people complaining about them in the way they complain about trash mobs. There are too many; it\'s boring to have to go through them; why can\'t it all just be the MSQ?</p><p>If you go back far enough, there didn\'t used to be such a harsh definition, either of quests or mobs. Without a dominant central questline, quests were more likely to seem interesting or worthwhile in their own right, either for the smaller stories they told, or for the xp or rewards they gave. Mobs, similarly, were more likely to have drops you might want or to give xp you might need, so it didn\'t seem like such an imposition to have to kill them on the way to doing other things.</p><p>I\'ve always thought the increased focus on story and on a central, obligatory MSQ was as much a problem as a solution. Yes, it keeps players both engaged and occupied but it also fosters the idea that once you\'re done with the story, you\'re done with the game. All that\'s left after that is a so-called end-game that\'s inevitably and unavoidably repetitive. For all the complaints about the "<i>grind</i>" of leveling in old-school MMORPGs , it\'s hard to see the current version as very much of an improvement. Or even all that different.</p><p>This, I\'m uncomfortably aware, is the hole I\'ve lowered myself into in <i>Wuthering Waves</i>. That game has a wealth of very satisfying and engaging content beyond the excellent MSQ and when I first started playing it I was having a fine old time exploring it all. At some point, though, I locked myself into the central storyline and the rest of the fascinating world disappeared behind a screen of (Admittedly first-rate.) cut scenes and set pieces.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPrO2_6Mk0mF3OKBxBM2yK3GsNl1tiOKVQ2cORgUef77YQ2c9sTM7sKwq6o8LuErwKbs7T57GyHe4-caguO7QsU7gJlVjJTU0z8OBI4CHtJDNRuaCxC-F0YCKQdFl3p8CUQ6tUkwHFUHg2BMxv1fSGE3ZN2PlFUm58PrRQB9jPuc6Xysn7RpT52Q0cXBQ/s1920/bpfish1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPrO2_6Mk0mF3OKBxBM2yK3GsNl1tiOKVQ2cORgUef77YQ2c9sTM7sKwq6o8LuErwKbs7T57GyHe4-caguO7QsU7gJlVjJTU0z8OBI4CHtJDNRuaCxC-F0YCKQdFl3p8CUQ6tUkwHFUHg2BMxv1fSGE3ZN2PlFUm58PrRQB9jPuc6Xysn7RpT52Q0cXBQ/w640-h360/bpfish1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>BP:SR is never going to have the same inherent literary or aesthetic value as the exceptional WW but the story running through the middle of it is still interesting enough to hold my attention and the game constantly nudges me to keep on with it to the exclusion of all else. Those nudges, though, are gentler and less persistent than in most games and that\'s why I\'m here now, considering my options.</p><p>When I play again later today, I think I\'m going to open up my Journal and start working through a few of those quests I seem to have picked up without even noticing. Maybe they\'ll be filler I wish I\'d skipped or maybe they\'ll be satisfying vignettes that shed light on the world <i>Floradelle </i>finds herself living in. Mostly, I suspect, they\'ll introduce me to aspects of the game I ought to know about.</p><p>One of them, for instance, introduces Fishing, which appears to be something entirely separate from Life Skills. There\'s another similarity with FFXIV.&nbsp; At least Fishing is always pretty straightforward. You know where you are with a fish.</p><p>Life Skills or Crafts are always a problem. In some games they\'re barely more than amusements and it makes no real difference which you pick but in others choosing the wrong one can be almost game-breaking. I\'ve never known any game give sufficient information up front to make that choice a truly informed one. It\'s always outside sources that tell you Class A <i>must </i>take Craft B and Craft B <i>needs</i> Secondary Craft C.</p><p>All of which means I\'ve already reached the point where I ought to do some research outside the game before I make any final decisions. Luckily, BP:SR is one of those games where there\'s plenty of advice available.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpwxvIJJFoLCpWu8XVwbEG66t6YyBD9MA5BDPJTPZ7sHjavscKON-BV5aK2QVBQT6Y0bL5hHeT9JxVD6wwWGKV0LZ81aRXoqm39D9jFHKhbl2JfXQg3Mo4A4XT-SrslofXsUID_xLhpcd_lna3oXcPALX01Us39VB8xCIGebhblUaBk3OIqwmL6cdJ3Ho/s1920/bpls1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpwxvIJJFoLCpWu8XVwbEG66t6YyBD9MA5BDPJTPZ7sHjavscKON-BV5aK2QVBQT6Y0bL5hHeT9JxVD6wwWGKV0LZ81aRXoqm39D9jFHKhbl2JfXQg3Mo4A4XT-SrslofXsUID_xLhpcd_lna3oXcPALX01Us39VB8xCIGebhblUaBk3OIqwmL6cdJ3Ho/w640-h360/bpls1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Here\'s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/blue-protocol/resources/life-skills-system-guide"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">an overview</span></a> of Life Skills. You\'ll note it says right at the start that they\'re "<i>a core part</i>" of the game, "<i>important for progressing your character</i>". Not just fluff for fun, then. <a href="https://maxroll.gg/blue-protocol/resources/weaving-guide"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">A detailed guide</span></a> to one of them, Weaving, makes it clear why that is: "<i>Weaving allows you to craft Epic and Legendary quality Intellect and Agility Helmets, Armor, Gauntlets, and Boots for the Verdant Oracle, Beat Performer, Frost Mage, Stormblade, and Marksman classes, as well as Strength, Intellect, and Agility Charms.</i>"</p><p>That does sound like it would be important. Fortunately, as <i>Icy Veins</i> <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/other-games/news/mastering-life-skills-in-blue-protocol-star-resonance/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">explains</span></a>, "<i>You’re not locked into just one or two professions. You can pick up as many Life Skills as you want</i>". The real limitation here is something called <i>Focus</i>, one of those infamous time-gated resources.&nbsp;</p><p>I think I prefer being able to learn all the crafts but not always having the energy to do them to always having enough puff but being locked into specific skills. I suppose being able to take them all and never having any limitations on their use would be the ideal but even that would present problems of its own in terms of the investment and commitment required to take advantage of that degree of freedom.</p><p>There\'s probably no perfect solution. So long as whatever\'s there seems fair within its context, it ought to be acceptable. Based on previous experiences in similar games, in my case, it\'s highly unlikely I\'ll ever do enough crafting to run up against the timegates, so from my perspective it will probably seem like I have complete freedom anyway.</p><p>Unless I really get into the housing, that is. Oh yes, there\'s housing! And you can craft furniture. That is the one place where I\'ve found myself hitting the limits in the past.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5gc2RrypZkbDsvcavXxcgbf0lqqm6AtOf-qHIp477EnYN2P5R4P263lfyKX7ZNdqdVJN8-bcum3MFcPBFUVt-9LsMk9tcTX6QLM9emXDKOO2UFtAnqCW9uLKIvtV1X5ee09Vc-ewRpTyG-RcI1Z3vLy5PqPYEZ84Bc4O1uNh3tq4eswYfl5LMC4ySTlE/s1920/bproom4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5gc2RrypZkbDsvcavXxcgbf0lqqm6AtOf-qHIp477EnYN2P5R4P263lfyKX7ZNdqdVJN8-bcum3MFcPBFUVt-9LsMk9tcTX6QLM9emXDKOO2UFtAnqCW9uLKIvtV1X5ee09Vc-ewRpTyG-RcI1Z3vLy5PqPYEZ84Bc4O1uNh3tq4eswYfl5LMC4ySTlE/w640-h360/bproom4.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>I thought I\'d gained access to the housing feature yesterday, when the Mayor of Asterleeds gave me a rent-free room in the inn for as long as I needed it, in gratitude for a service I\'d done the city.

That\'s what your all asking, isn\'t it? Isn\'t it? Well, I\'m going to tell you anyway.</p><p>It\'s going pretty well as far as I can make out. As I write, at just before nine in the morning, UK time, on a Sunday, there are almost forty-six thousand people playing on <i>Steam</i> (Sixty-two thousand as I edit this at five PM.)&nbsp;from an all-time peak of just under eighty thousand. It\'s clearly holding an audience for the time being. Recent history for just about all MMORPGs released on Steam in the last couple of years suggests another month will see a huge fall-off in numbers but maybe this will be the sticky exception to that unfortunate trend.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, I was going to make a comparison with <i>Crystal of Atlan</i>, a somewhat similar game that launched back at the beginning of summer and which I was playing quite regularly, until suddenly I wasn\'t. Unfortunately, the Steam chart for that game isn\'t working. It brings up an "<i>Internal Server Error</i>", something I\'ve never seen before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And guess why that is. I just figured it out. Crystal of Atlan isn\'t on Steam! I\'ve been playing it through it\'s own standalone launcher for which I have a desktop icon. But I have lots of desktop icons for Steam games too so that\'s easy to forgive. I\'m so used to everything I play being on Steam I just assume that\'s where everything that\'s not really old is going, even if I\'m clicking my desktop to get there.</p><p>So how if it\'s not on Steam, how come the Steam chart even recognizes Crystal of Atlan to give me the error message? Shouldn\'t it just be telling me it doesn\'t exist? That turns out to be because <i>CoA </i>is coming to Steam in just over two weeks, on the 30 October.&nbsp; I don\'t know if it\'s going to be possible to link an existing account to Steam when it happens but I hope so. I might start playing again then.</p><p>Let\'s get back to BP:SR. That\'s what we\'re here for, after all. The numbers look good. How about the reviews? Those were very bad for a while. Have they improved?</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2drcdmDq9Uvtu7-arzZBhCVpebUBLdNmFG36aa-V4vZInFqkW5iVCtRE9lQoOW02MPs434OFO8ltXE-WQXiz4Wucb_tJD6ec3ID3q8rpDdf0CEdiO_UldY7CLfYKXmzPeUQSJqX3f6M3OWryBBtaJx0zld-QpMTJDnNzDlG6rmGrWOteWYG775gcvTiw/s1920/bproom2.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2drcdmDq9Uvtu7-arzZBhCVpebUBLdNmFG36aa-V4vZInFqkW5iVCtRE9lQoOW02MPs434OFO8ltXE-WQXiz4Wucb_tJD6ec3ID3q8rpDdf0CEdiO_UldY7CLfYKXmzPeUQSJqX3f6M3OWryBBtaJx0zld-QpMTJDnNzDlG6rmGrWOteWYG775gcvTiw/w640-h360/bproom2.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>Yep. A lot. The overall rating is "<i>Mixed</i>" now from a shade under five thousand reviews, of which 48% are positive. That\'s not so much mixed as polarized. It\'s too soon for there to be a "<i>Recent</i>" filter - all the reviews are "<i>recent</i>", the game not having been out for a week yet - but the selection of new reviews highlighted on the main page seem far less hysterical, whether they recommend the game or not.</p><p>It would seem logical that all the pile-ons who never planned on playing the game, the ones who only wanted to have a bit of cruel fun poking it with a stick, have moved on to the next target, leaving mostly people who actually want to give the game a fair shake. And most of those players are saying things like "<i>It\'s pretty fun for what it is: a casual oriented F2P anime MMO</i>" and "<i>Free to play anime mmo with gatch. Not bad for what it is.</i>"&nbsp;</p><p>Even the negative reviews are far more balanced now, often making some positive points before concluding the game isn\'t for them. There\'s praise for the visuals, the cosmetics, the world-building, the characters and even, in a minority of cases, the gameplay and combat. The main issues people can\'t seem to get over are the time-gating, the myriad currencies and the general mobile free-to-playness of the whole shebang.</p><p>Which is fair. Both the negatives and the positives are in harmony there. It\'s a port of a Chinese F2P mobile MMO that\'s had some, but not a lot, of work done to fit it for a PC audience. If you\'re cool with that, then BP:SR is a decent game. If you\'re not, it\'s annoying and not worth your time. Seems reasonable.</p><p>There was one review that really stood out for me, though. It\'s very short. I\'ll quote it in full.</p><p></p><blockquote><b><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really boring game I ever played. Just more talk than action anything. This game really not interesting if just more talk and no action."</span></b></blockquote><p></p><p></p><blockquote></blockquote><p></p><p>I totally see where the writer is coming from, although I disagree strongly with their conclusion. I have just over three and a half hours played now and I would estimate no more than ten or fifteen minutes of that has been spent fighting mobs or bosses. An action MMO it is not.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd32SkEzL4kjWKuR6syRzCTJp_A7G6ijERhDxyvUp-iQPMf-jnFNLa1oA4-P1iNDvBhn6dXY-Z9cs_D-Lwg5Bs9bHFe_xJ_UjxkZyX1NXAi16p08RTWvkeT_1e4HWg0Vb_l1hs48JtqNBGHxhGgLPUt9KUInCtuiKJXPuwKBkQ-YkNrpSMTq6KIiLdX88/s1920/bplight1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd32SkEzL4kjWKuR6syRzCTJp_A7G6ijERhDxyvUp-iQPMf-jnFNLa1oA4-P1iNDvBhn6dXY-Z9cs_D-Lwg5Bs9bHFe_xJ_UjxkZyX1NXAi16p08RTWvkeT_1e4HWg0Vb_l1hs48JtqNBGHxhGgLPUt9KUInCtuiKJXPuwKBkQ-YkNrpSMTq6KIiLdX88/w640-h360/bplight1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p></p><p>Travel, which often bulks out the played time in any kind of open world game, isn\'t taking up the slack either. There\'s the usual amount of running about but the distances involved are very small. Frequently, the next person you need to speak to is standing right across the street from where you are. New locations you have to visit are often less than fifty yards away. There are teleport points everywhere but as yet it hasn\'t even been worth using them.</p><p>No, almost all of my three and a half hours has been spent either talking to NPCs or listening to them talk to each other. There are some proper, animated cut scenes but far more of those tableaus where you see all the characters standing in the foreground having long conversations to which you are occasionally invited to contribute.</p><p>"<i>More talk than action</i>" is a very accurate description of the gameplay so far. Whether you find that boring or entertaining will be entirely down to your personal preferences. Personally, I\'ve been enjoying it quite a bit. It\'s not great literature, even by gaming standards, but it\'s witty in places, light-hearted and cheerful and it\'s largely been a pleasure letting it all drift past as I watch and read.</p><p>I see from some of the other reviews that the "<i>end game</i>" involves a lot of repeated dungeon-running, for which you need energy of some kind as is the norm in these games. That\'s why people are complaining about the time-gating. I don\'t know how long it takes to get to that point, although if people are complaining about it already it can\'t be very long. I\'ve seen five hours mentioned although that seems very fast to complete a full main story quest.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s very likely my experience is going to be the reverse of what the commenter I quoted above was complaining about. I imagine I\'ll find the part when the talk stops and the action begins to be the boring bit. I certainly won\'t be running any dungeons more than once or twice, that\'s for sure. It\'s more likely I won\'t set foot in them at all unless the story demands it and even then they\'d better be easy or I\'ll be off.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT3y1io-xpPXdJdJXlR7ZkOO7DcN_G3668WaptMsLe0stKrrUOT-lg44iHg9sclNqZWDBxqQoAtTtODdSqaJKcEazWhNUW3CLX9iBd5l_MltTGT-gFCUX2dvzQ5byLN6goiJvlDLdEa9hBY8F_pTZtkg1cbfWY5hiiVMJiLaNMH4FT2uqfG-AAAXOeruc/s1920/bpbar1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT3y1io-xpPXdJdJXlR7ZkOO7DcN_G3668WaptMsLe0stKrrUOT-lg44iHg9sclNqZWDBxqQoAtTtODdSqaJKcEazWhNUW3CLX9iBd5l_MltTGT-gFCUX2dvzQ5byLN6goiJvlDLdEa9hBY8F_pTZtkg1cbfWY5hiiVMJiLaNMH4FT2uqfG-AAAXOeruc/w640-h360/bpbar1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I am clearly not the real target market for the games I enjoy, which is a bit weird when I think about it. It\'s not just that I\'m too old for them, although obviously I am. I completed a survey for the game last night and the upper age limit was 36+. I was older than that when I started playing online games, back in the 90s!</p><p>I tend to like the parts of these games I suspect the intended audience would prefer weren\'t there at all. The pointless busy-work of the side quests, the derivitive and poorly-writen storylines, the unecessary cross-country travel, the myriad crafting mats I pick up and then leave in storage and never use...</p><p>And I like seeing the sights and taking holiday snaps with the quirky in-game cameras. BP:SR has one of those and it\'s quite good although I haven\'t quite figured out exactly how all the controls work quite yet. I\'m having fun playing around with them though. I\'ll be trying the Selfie option next so there\'s something to look forward to.</p><p>Another thing I\'ve seen plenty of complaints about are the many currencies the game uses. Someone on Steam made a handy list:</p><p><b>Rose Orb<br />Rose Orb (Bound)<br />Luno<br />Luno (Bound)<br />Meowlux Premium Card<br />Meow Coin<br />Meowlux Vault Card<br />Meowlux Wish Coin<br />Homestead Coins<br />Friendship Points<br />Honor Coin<br />Will Wish Coin<br />Asteria Reputation<br />Season 1 Points (SRP)<br />Silver Star Badge</b></p><p>My reaction on seeing it? You call that a <i>lot</i>?? Also, you think it\'s just imported mobile F2P games that do this?? Think again, pal!</p><p><a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Currency"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Here\'s a link</span></a> to the wiki page listing all the <i>EverQuest II</i> currencies. There are sixty-seven of them and I\'m not convinced that list is complete.

What about me?&nbsp;<p></p><p>I\'ve been having fun. I\'m looking forward to getting back to... erm, what\'s the world called again... ah, yes, <i>Regnus</i>, that\'s it. (Had to look it up...) Levels come very fast, which is nice, although it also suggests the leveling process is short and that "<i>end game</i>" (Which I keep putting in quotes because if people are in it a matter of hours or even days from launch, it probably ought just to be called "<i>the game</i>".) is going to arrive all too soon.</p><p>Levels come so fast I can\'t keep up. I believe I dinged Level 20 just before I logged out last night. I have a ton of skills and talents and other stuff to upgrade that I\'ve been trying to ignore because to me<i> that\'s </i>the boring part. Fortunately I noticed right at the end that there\'s an auto-upgrade option for at least some of it, something I will most definitely be using.</p><p>Much more exciting than stats and skills are the mounts and accessories I\'ve been getting. So far I\'ve received three mounts. One, a boarlet, is from the storyline but it\'s the slowest and I haven\'t tried it yet. There\'s a wolf which I think is a pre-registration reward and a bunny that comes from one or other of the many "<i>Events</i>", by which they mostly mean log-in and attendance rewards. I didn\'t notice which of them it was. I just clicked Claim and it appeared.</p><p>The Wolf and the Bunny are identical in speed and they both look great. I\'m swapping between them at the moment although the rabbit has the edge due to looking goofier.&nbsp;</p><p>As for cosmetics, so far I\'ve received a bizarre monocle, a much nicer pair of spectacles, some headphones, a full set of street clothes and a leaf for my character to hold in her mouth like some kind of... well, I was going to say yokel but really, who <i>does </i>walk around with a leaf sticking out of their mouth? I\'m pretty sure I\'ve never seen anything like it in a game before, so it is at least original.</p><p>This, of course, is exactly what I want from a game like this and so far I\'m getting it in spades so I\'m happy. How long it\'s going to last is anyone\'s guess but I\'m riding the train until runs into the aforementioned "<i>end game</i>" buffers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Or until I get distracted by the next shiny, new toy and wander off, never to return, which seems to be who I am these days.&nbsp;</p><p>Could be worse.&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5J4-sFMZfWWn69PK6BVWA9NixZAjze3Lg4CIsN24UYQHQNzUt-iBJsTUf1bzeip2DpcX7vt38NLTAiIc9eV_fQxD1rmJby-huG2q0FRwDk3XT7p81XcZBA7mKdHs-roz9vBzGBuXN3x5VFBSOReabAxUd4m1_MDUaViEfdZrcwlxyWDYI9PduXDV6PzY/s1920/bpbunny1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5J4-sFMZfWWn69PK6BVWA9NixZAjze3Lg4CIsN24UYQHQNzUt-iBJsTUf1bzeip2DpcX7vt38NLTAiIc9eV_fQxD1rmJby-huG2q0FRwDk3XT7p81XcZBA7mKdHs-roz9vBzGBuXN3x5VFBSOReabAxUd4m1_MDUaViEfdZrcwlxyWDYI9PduXDV6PzY/w640-h360/bpbunny1.png" width="640" /></a>How\'s <i>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</i> going then?

There\'s the usual amount of running about but the distances involved are very small. Frequently, the next person you need to speak to is standing right across the street from where you are. New locations you have to visit are often less than fifty yards away. There are teleport points everywhere but as yet it hasn\'t even been worth using them.</p><p>No, almost all of my three and a half hours has been spent either talking to NPCs or listening to them talk to each other. There are some proper, animated cut scenes but far more of those tableaus where you see all the characters standing in the foreground having long conversations to which you are occasionally invited to contribute.</p><p>"<i>More talk than action</i>" is a very accurate description of the gameplay so far. Whether you find that boring or entertaining will be entirely down to your personal preferences. Personally, I\'ve been enjoying it quite a bit. It\'s not great literature, even by gaming standards, but it\'s witty in places, light-hearted and cheerful and it\'s largely been a pleasure letting it all drift past as I watch and read.</p><p>I see from some of the other reviews that the "<i>end game</i>" involves a lot of repeated dungeon-running, for which you need energy of some kind as is the norm in these games. That\'s why people are complaining about the time-gating. I don\'t know how long it takes to get to that point, although if people are complaining about it already it can\'t be very long. I\'ve seen five hours mentioned although that seems very fast to complete a full main story quest.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s very likely my experience is going to be the reverse of what the commenter I quoted above was complaining about. I imagine I\'ll find the part when the talk stops and the action begins to be the boring bit. I certainly won\'t be running any dungeons more than once or twice, that\'s for sure. It\'s more likely I won\'t set foot in them at all unless the story demands it and even then they\'d better be easy or I\'ll be off.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT3y1io-xpPXdJdJXlR7ZkOO7DcN_G3668WaptMsLe0stKrrUOT-lg44iHg9sclNqZWDBxqQoAtTtODdSqaJKcEazWhNUW3CLX9iBd5l_MltTGT-gFCUX2dvzQ5byLN6goiJvlDLdEa9hBY8F_pTZtkg1cbfWY5hiiVMJiLaNMH4FT2uqfG-AAAXOeruc/s1920/bpbar1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgT3y1io-xpPXdJdJXlR7ZkOO7DcN_G3668WaptMsLe0stKrrUOT-lg44iHg9sclNqZWDBxqQoAtTtODdSqaJKcEazWhNUW3CLX9iBd5l_MltTGT-gFCUX2dvzQ5byLN6goiJvlDLdEa9hBY8F_pTZtkg1cbfWY5hiiVMJiLaNMH4FT2uqfG-AAAXOeruc/w640-h360/bpbar1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I am clearly not the real target market for the games I enjoy, which is a bit weird when I think about it. It\'s not just that I\'m too old for them, although obviously I am. I completed a survey for the game last night and the upper age limit was 36+. I was older than that when I started playing online games, back in the 90s!</p><p>I tend to like the parts of these games I suspect the intended audience would prefer weren\'t there at all. The pointless busy-work of the side quests, the derivitive and poorly-writen storylines, the unecessary cross-country travel, the myriad crafting mats I pick up and then leave in storage and never use...</p><p>And I like seeing the sights and taking holiday snaps with the quirky in-game cameras. BP:SR has one of those and it\'s quite good although I haven\'t quite figured out exactly how all the controls work quite yet. I\'m having fun playing around with them though. I\'ll be trying the Selfie option next so there\'s something to look forward to.</p><p>Another thing I\'ve seen plenty of complaints about are the many currencies the game uses. Someone on Steam made a handy list:</p><p><b>Rose Orb<br />Rose Orb (Bound)<br />Luno<br />Luno (Bound)<br />Meowlux Premium Card<br />Meow Coin<br />Meowlux Vault Card<br />Meowlux Wish Coin<br />Homestead Coins<br />Friendship Points<br />Honor Coin<br />Will Wish Coin<br />Asteria Reputation<br />Season 1 Points (SRP)<br />Silver Star Badge</b></p><p>My reaction on seeing it? You call that a <i>lot</i>?? Also, you think it\'s just imported mobile F2P games that do this?? Think again, pal!</p><p><a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Currency"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Here\'s a link</span></a> to the wiki page listing all the <i>EverQuest II</i> currencies.

What about me?&nbsp;<p></p><p>I\'ve been having fun. I\'m looking forward to getting back to... erm, what\'s the world called again... ah, yes, <i>Regnus</i>, that\'s it. (Had to look it up...) Levels come very fast, which is nice, although it also suggests the leveling process is short and that "<i>end game</i>" (Which I keep putting in quotes because if people are in it a matter of hours or even days from launch, it probably ought just to be called "<i>the game</i>".) is going to arrive all too soon.</p><p>Levels come so fast I can\'t keep up. I believe I dinged Level 20 just before I logged out last night. I have a ton of skills and talents and other stuff to upgrade that I\'ve been trying to ignore because to me<i> that\'s </i>the boring part. Fortunately I noticed right at the end that there\'s an auto-upgrade option for at least some of it, something I will most definitely be using.</p><p>Much more exciting than stats and skills are the mounts and accessories I\'ve been getting. So far I\'ve received three mounts. One, a boarlet, is from the storyline but it\'s the slowest and I haven\'t tried it yet. There\'s a wolf which I think is a pre-registration reward and a bunny that comes from one or other of the many "<i>Events</i>", by which they mostly mean log-in and attendance rewards. I didn\'t notice which of them it was. I just clicked Claim and it appeared.</p><p>The Wolf and the Bunny are identical in speed and they both look great. I\'m swapping between them at the moment although the rabbit has the edge due to looking goofier.&nbsp;</p><p>As for cosmetics, so far I\'ve received a bizarre monocle, a much nicer pair of spectacles, some headphones, a full set of street clothes and a leaf for my character to hold in her mouth like some kind of... well, I was going to say yokel but really, who <i>does </i>walk around with a leaf sticking out of their mouth? I\'m pretty sure I\'ve never seen anything like it in a game before, so it is at least original.</p><p>This, of course, is exactly what I want from a game like this and so far I\'m getting it in spades so I\'m happy. How long it\'s going to last is anyone\'s guess but I\'m riding the train until runs into the aforementioned "<i>end game</i>" buffers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Or until I get distracted by the next shiny, new toy and wander off, never to return, which seems to be who I am these days.&nbsp;</p><p>Could be worse.&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/blue-protocol-star-resonance-more-first.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/blue-protocol-star-resonance-more-first.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5J4-sFMZfWWn69PK6BVWA9NixZAjze3Lg4CIsN24UYQHQNzUt-iBJsTUf1bzeip2DpcX7vt38NLTAiIc9eV_fQxD1rmJby-huG2q0FRwDk3XT7p81XcZBA7mKdHs-roz9vBzGBuXN3x5VFBSOReabAxUd4m1_MDUaViEfdZrcwlxyWDYI9PduXDV6PzY/s72-w640-h360-c/bpbunny1.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '1'}

If they\'d make an album I\'d add it to my\n  wishlist so someone could give it to me but so far there\'s only one EP and I\n  can listen to that for nothing.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  How do bands <i>expect </i>make money these days? No wonder they\'re all\n  complaining how it\'s just for middle-class kids with rich, indulgent parents\n  or nepo babies with connections.

No wonder everyone has to have a day job.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I mean, that\'s been the life of every writer, artist and musician for\n  centuries but I\'m sure it\'s worse now. When I was in my twenties,\n  <i>Margaret Thatche</i>r used to personally pay for rehearsal rooms and beer\n  for every aspiring indie band in the country, by way of the Enterprise\n  Allowance Scheme. And she funded all the wannabe comic artists scrawling inept\n  cartoons about how awful she was, too. Seriously, half the people I knew in\n  the \'eighties were on that scheme.

Balance, they call it. Here\'s my\n  version.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, <i>the Dollheads</i>\n  <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://devolutionmagazine.co.uk/2024/08/27/interview-the-rebellion-tapes-the-dollheads-we-grew-up-around-a-lot-of-music-and-a-lot-of-punk-that-our-parents-played/">are</a></span><i>&nbsp;"three siblings under twenty from Las Vegas with two UK tours under\n    their belts, an EP, an album...</i>" in fact, you can make that three tours of the UK because the only reason I\n  know they exist is because I was walking through town a couple of months ago\n  and I stopped to read one of those posters for a small venue (Back room of a\n  pub, near enough.) with&nbsp; a list of bands that were going to be on in the\n  coming weeks and one of them was called the Dollheads and the poster said\n  something like "<i>From Las Vegas, back for their third time...</i>" and I\n  thought that seemed a bit weird, to come all the way from the US to the UK to\n  play a venue I know for a fact has only ever hosted very small acts, barely\n  even on the circuit, in all the time I\'ve lived here, which is thirty years\n  now, so when I got home I looked them up and it got even weirder because\n  they\'re basically children, so how is this even possible?\n</p>\n<p>\n  I do love a good run-on sentence, don\'t you? Anyway, I have no explanation as\n  to how this band can keep criss-crossing the Atlantic to play in pubs in small\n  cities that barely even have a rock scene to begin with but they\'re doing it, so it happens, so everyone else can stop whining. Or something. That\'s how\n  balance works, isn\'t it?\n</p>\n<p>\n  As to why I\'ve waited this long to mention it, it\'s because I don\'t actually\n  like what they sound like much.

No video for this one. Won\'t bother some people. (Hi, <i>Redbeard</i>!) Also we\'ve had some\n  good videos already. We can afford to give our eyes a rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t know why but I keep thinking <i>Miya Folick</i>\'s an actor with a\n  side-hustle as a pop star, like a lot of them. She\'s not. She\'s a full-time singer-songwriter.

Just this week I was having a chat with someone at work about AI, warning\n  them to double-check everything, which of course means doing the work yourself\n  so why even bother asking AI to begin with? I mention it because it just\n  occurred to me to I probably ought to check Miya\'s pronouns before I go to\n  print so I ran "<i>Miya Folick pronouns</i>" through Google and the helpful AI\n  summary at the top confidently told me "<i>Miya Folick uses they/them pronouns. This is most clearly stated in a\n    profile that identifies them under their musical moniker Babebee.</i>" Gemini then clarified its position: "<i>Other sources refer to Miya Folick without mentioning their pronouns\n    explicitly, using "she/her" based on the name "Miya," but this is not\n    confirmed by the artist themselves and is therefore less reliable.</i>"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Her Wikipedia entry would beg to differ. It refers to her as "<i>she/her</i>"\n  throughout. And so does Miya (Who\'d also like you know her name is pronounced\n  Meee-yaaa, not Maya.)&nbsp; In an interview she gave only this summer to\n  <i><a href="https://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/I1939600"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Chicago\'s GoPride</span></a></i>\n  she answered a direct question about her pronouns with&nbsp; "<i>...she/her, thank you for asking.</i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I know there are a lot of people who\'d like us to stop caring about pronouns\n  and another bunch who\'d like us to believe Gemini getting it wrong is a\n  conspiracy but actually AI just isn\'t very good, still. That\'s the takeaway.\n  Use it but never, ever trust it. Always verify.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that kind of got us away from the song, which is just gorgeous. And\n  boy, I\'m editorializing a lot today, aren\'t I? We\'ll run out of time for tunes\n  if I go on like this.

I might be the last person left in Britain who\'s never watched a single\n  episode of <i>Bake-Off</i> but you\'d have had to been living in an Antarctic Survey\n  Station for the last fifteen years, with only enough fuel left in the generators to keep the heating on, not\n  to know exactly how it works.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Also, in the interests of journalistic accuracy, I <i>have </i>seen bits of it\n  because Mrs. Bhagpuss watches it sometimes. It\'s not her favorite crafting\n  competition by a very long way but she\'ll watch just about anyone making\n  anything while she\'s making things herself.\n</p>\n<p>The song\'s pretty good, too.

And\n  so far they\'ve never disappointed. If they\'d make an album I\'d add it to my\n  wishlist so someone could give it to me but so far there\'s only one EP and I\n  can listen to that for nothing.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  How do bands <i>expect </i>make money these days? No wonder they\'re all\n  complaining how it\'s just for middle-class kids with rich, indulgent parents\n  or nepo babies with connections. No wonder everyone\'s cancelling all the time,\n  saying they can\'t afford to tour. No wonder everyone has to have a day job.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I mean, that\'s been the life of every writer, artist and musician for\n  centuries but I\'m sure it\'s worse now. When I was in my twenties,\n  <i>Margaret Thatche</i>r used to personally pay for rehearsal rooms and beer\n  for every aspiring indie band in the country, by way of the Enterprise\n  Allowance Scheme. And she funded all the wannabe comic artists scrawling inept\n  cartoons about how awful she was, too. Seriously, half the people I knew in\n  the \'eighties were on that scheme. I felt like an idiot for not giving up my\n  job and joining them, sometimes.\n</p>\n<p>Sorry, I seem to have fallen down a memory hole and I can\'t get up.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>&nbsp;Burger King Is Hiring</i> - The Dollheads</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  You know how some media channels do that really irritating thing, where\n  they get someone on to refute the previous speaker, even when everyone knows\n  what they were saying was irrefutable? Balance, they call it. Here\'s my\n  version.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, <i>the Dollheads</i>\n  <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://devolutionmagazine.co.uk/2024/08/27/interview-the-rebellion-tapes-the-dollheads-we-grew-up-around-a-lot-of-music-and-a-lot-of-punk-that-our-parents-played/">are</a></span><i>&nbsp;"three siblings under twenty from Las Vegas with two UK tours under\n    their belts, an EP, an album...</i>" in fact, you can make that three tours of the UK because the only reason I\n  know they exist is because I was walking through town a couple of months ago\n  and I stopped to read one of those posters for a small venue (Back room of a\n  pub, near enough.) with&nbsp; a list of bands that were going to be on in the\n  coming weeks and one of them was called the Dollheads and the poster said\n  something like "<i>From Las Vegas, back for their third time...</i>" and I\n  thought that seemed a bit weird, to come all the way from the US to the UK to\n  play a venue I know for a fact has only ever hosted very small acts, barely\n  even on the circuit, in all the time I\'ve lived here, which is thirty years\n  now, so when I got home I looked them up and it got even weirder because\n  they\'re basically children, so how is this even possible?\n</p>\n<p>\n  I do love a good run-on sentence, don\'t you? Anyway, I have no explanation as\n  to how this band can keep criss-crossing the Atlantic to play in pubs in small\n  cities that barely even have a rock scene to begin with but they\'re doing it, so it happens, so everyone else can stop whining. Or something. That\'s how\n  balance works, isn\'t it?\n</p>\n<p>\n  As to why I\'ve waited this long to mention it, it\'s because I don\'t actually\n  like what they sound like much. This is pretty much the only song of theirs\n  I\'ve heard that I\'d want to share and I\'ve been waiting for the right moment,\n  which apparently this was.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>Now we can move on.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>&nbsp;<i>He\'s My Man {The Anniversary}&nbsp;</i></b></span>\n</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>&nbsp;Luvcat with Dr. John Cooper Clarke</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  There are a lot of surprising things about <i>Dr. John Cooper Clarke</i>, not\n  the least of them being that he\'s still alive, let alone making new music with\n  people a quarter his age.

We can afford to give our eyes a rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t know why but I keep thinking <i>Miya Folick</i>\'s an actor with a\n  side-hustle as a pop star, like a lot of them. She\'s not. She\'s a full-time singer-songwriter. She did study\n  acting but I don\'t think she\'s ever done it for a living.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I got that from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miya_Folick"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">her Wikipedia page</span></a>. Just this week I was having a chat with someone at work about AI, warning\n  them to double-check everything, which of course means doing the work yourself\n  so why even bother asking AI to begin with? I mention it because it just\n  occurred to me to I probably ought to check Miya\'s pronouns before I go to\n  print so I ran "<i>Miya Folick pronouns</i>" through Google and the helpful AI\n  summary at the top confidently told me "<i>Miya Folick uses they/them pronouns. This is most clearly stated in a\n    profile that identifies them under their musical moniker Babebee.</i>" Gemini then clarified its position: "<i>Other sources refer to Miya Folick without mentioning their pronouns\n    explicitly, using "she/her" based on the name "Miya," but this is not\n    confirmed by the artist themselves and is therefore less reliable.</i>"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Her Wikipedia entry would beg to differ. It refers to her as "<i>she/her</i>"\n  throughout. And so does Miya (Who\'d also like you know her name is pronounced\n  Meee-yaaa, not Maya.)&nbsp; In an interview she gave only this summer to\n  <i><a href="https://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/I1939600"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Chicago\'s GoPride</span></a></i>\n  she answered a direct question about her pronouns with&nbsp; "<i>...she/her, thank you for asking.</i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I know there are a lot of people who\'d like us to stop caring about pronouns\n  and another bunch who\'d like us to believe Gemini getting it wrong is a\n  conspiracy but actually AI just isn\'t very good, still. That\'s the takeaway.\n  Use it but never, ever trust it. Always verify.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that kind of got us away from the song, which is just gorgeous. And\n  boy, I\'m editorializing a lot today, aren\'t I? We\'ll run out of time for tunes\n  if I go on like this.

What are people complaining about? Yes, it exists but it\'s off by default. Are they switching it on just so they can complain about it? (I imagine that\'s exactly what\'s happening.)</p><p>I\'ve been reading about auto-battle in mobile ports for ages but so far I can\'t remember playing any that had it. I wish they did. I\'d love to be able to let the game deal with all those open-world Tacet Discords in <i>Wuthering Waves</i>, for example.</p><p>I was positively excited to try the feature out in <i>BP:SR</i>.&nbsp; When I arrived at my first combat moment in the game, something that\'s a surprisingly long time coming, I waited to see what would happen.

You do have to remember to toggle it off again when you\'re done or else your character will just charge from mob to mob in a never-ending killing spree but I even liked that part. It made me feel like I had some agency, without needing to make an effort, which is pretty much perfect gameplay from my perspective.</p><p>I doubt auto-battling is going to cut it in whatever passes for difficult group content in this game but since I\'m extremely unlikely ever to engage in any of that, why would I care?

Conversely, if I\'m in the mood to do my own running and fighting, as I sometimes am, I\'ll do them. This game gives me the choice and I cannot for the life of me see why anyone would claim that\'s a Bad Thing, let alone rant about it in a review. (Erm... didn\'t you just do exactly that yourself, only in reverse?)</p><p>Speaking of doing dumb quests for dumb NPCs, that\'s another of the sticks being used to beat the game. When I was skimming the Steam reviews yesterday I saw several negative comments about how boring the quests were and how the cut scenes weren\'t worth watching. Related complaints involved poor translations and completely untranslated voice acting.</p><p>Based on my experience so far (Which is about four or five times longer than that of many of the people making those comments, many of whom had spent barely half an hour in the game.) only one of those observations is true. There is no English dub for the Chinese voice acting.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s not at all unusual in imported MMORPGs and I\'m in two minds about whether it\'s a problem or not. Voice acting is a bit of a double-edged sword in that, when done well, it does add hugely to both immersion and storytelling, but when done badly (Or even averagely.) it\'s often more annoying than not having it at all.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiB7hB8PwwkwiWaBnFy5UcXls1sCgt-JxlVsI1YoX6PHBsXHdq_qYzbpReKJh3-fq8k_-pBFpIqMzcqCsWMtopNr1QjW1hYKWXM2dyJ8TSUONFDOwqnEoPAxqJiRRoXE-xKhN9FVelz1FDo4bZ5OgFzECZvFHQ9dd4DH5vfMnxIcN-VRpZ4c1sW0XGAcps/s1043/bpstreet1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiB7hB8PwwkwiWaBnFy5UcXls1sCgt-JxlVsI1YoX6PHBsXHdq_qYzbpReKJh3-fq8k_-pBFpIqMzcqCsWMtopNr1QjW1hYKWXM2dyJ8TSUONFDOwqnEoPAxqJiRRoXE-xKhN9FVelz1FDo4bZ5OgFzECZvFHQ9dd4DH5vfMnxIcN-VRpZ4c1sW0XGAcps/w400-h388/bpstreet1.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>And even good voice acting slows everything down. I can read the text in maybe a quarter of the time it takes to listen to it. Cutting actors off mid-speech is jarring and anyway, if the acting is good, I feel I ought to keep it on and appreciate it, but even then I\'m often twitching to get on with things.&nbsp;<p></p><p>Only when the writing and the voice acting are both well above average, as for example in <i>Wuthering Waves</i>, does it feel like time well-spent to pay them each full attention. And as I\'ve said numerous times, that in itself is enervating.&nbsp;</p><p>Probably the main reason I play Wuthering Waves so infrequently is because the writing and voice acting are too good for what I want from that kind of video game. It\'s a level of quality that actually puts me off engaging with it because of the commitment it demands. I mean, if I wanted to watch a pretty good movie, I\'d do that instead.</p><p>For that reason, I was actively pleased to be able to go into the settings for BP:SR and switch NPC voices off. I couldn\'t understand them and the audio was carrying on long after I\'d finished reading the text, so it seemed like the obvious choice. I\'d rate the lack of English voices as at worst a neutral factor but probably a positive for the game as a whole. I kind of hope they never add them although by my own previous argument I guess I have to accept that it would be better to have the option.</p><p>How about the text, though? <i>Is </i>it badly translated? And those quests. <i>Are </i>they boring? The cut scenes, too. Is the only sensible choice to skip them?</p><p>No, no and no.&nbsp;</p><p>The dialog is well-translated, albeit with that odd lilt that\'s become so very familiar. It\'s idiomatic and grammatically correct and yet it still somehow has a slight off-kilter feel to it. And I like that. It\'s like hearing someone speak excellent English, only with a very slight, pleasant accent. What\'s the problem?</p><p>As for content, the quests are no more boring than any other quest in any other game of this stripe and considerably less boring than many. So far it\'s all been very standard stuff, although starting with the equivalent of half a dozen quests of the type you\'d normally find in an in-game holiday is a brave opening move.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the first half-hour of the game proper <i>is </i>a holiday event, to all intents and purposes. I\'m guessing that quite a bit of BP:SR is going to revolve around non-combat activities so it makes sense to introduce that style of gameplay early. I certainly enjoyed it.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju5hWMmQWMtiAi5XJtkqEPZF-ZOf14nffIIA98pv1weBrTwpofGRUVAl3wUyCWRjzDEa4AkBHqdEzKsw0Z8fP9DUBxnDw7OMxi5XYfGgqgFQDcV_rlgTTLGWUZP2Tv9OWTfqzzXgIys8Hak60fkYlHE_WEWwbazlMV4J3A2sF0j8n6acYhqu35o82YT9U/s1076/bppillar1.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju5hWMmQWMtiAi5XJtkqEPZF-ZOf14nffIIA98pv1weBrTwpofGRUVAl3wUyCWRjzDEa4AkBHqdEzKsw0Z8fP9DUBxnDw7OMxi5XYfGgqgFQDcV_rlgTTLGWUZP2Tv9OWTfqzzXgIys8Hak60fkYlHE_WEWwbazlMV4J3A2sF0j8n6acYhqu35o82YT9U/w392-h640/bppillar1.png" width="392" /></a></div>When the storyline does move on to killing mobs, first some harmless deer-creatures just outside the city and then some corrupted creatures and the aforementioned bad guy responsible for creating them, the quests involved are precisely what you\'d expect. They\'re wholly unoriginal and they very definitely aren\'t going to win any prizes.<p></p><p>But who would expect anything else? The dialog is sprightly and sparkling, the NPCs are quirky and <br />amusing, the stakes are low, the action is straightforward and we all had a jolly good time. Isn\'t that the what we\'re here for? It\'s a light-hearted video game, designed to be played in short bursts on a mobile phone, now also made available for the convenience and pleasure of PC users. What were you expecting?</p><p>I liked the quests. I liked the NPCs. I liked the dialog. I liked the story. I am clearly very easy to please and glad of it, too. So much better than the other way around.</p><p>As for the cut-scenes, there weren\'t many but they were fine. I didn\'t skip any nor feel the need to. You\'d need to be a lot more impatient than I am to find them too tedious to sit through. Or have much higher cultural and aesthetic standards, I suppose. In which case, I\'d politely ask you what the hell you thought you were doing when you downloaded this game.</p><p>And there we have it. The main reasons I\'ve seen for rubbishing Blue Protocol: Star Resonance, all comprehensively rubbished themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s not going to win any awards. It\'s not going to change the medium or even the genre. It\'s not going to challenge you or inspire you or bring you to some sort of emotional catharsis. If any of that is what you\'re looking for, there are plenty of other games that would suit you better.</p><p>This one is merely capable of entertaining and amusing in the moment, which is a lot more than nothing. It\'s also pretty to look at, fun to play and it has a welcome feel-good attitude. If that\'s what you want, you could do worse.

Voice acting is a bit of a double-edged sword in that, when done well, it does add hugely to both immersion and storytelling, but when done badly (Or even averagely.) it\'s often more annoying than not having it at all.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiB7hB8PwwkwiWaBnFy5UcXls1sCgt-JxlVsI1YoX6PHBsXHdq_qYzbpReKJh3-fq8k_-pBFpIqMzcqCsWMtopNr1QjW1hYKWXM2dyJ8TSUONFDOwqnEoPAxqJiRRoXE-xKhN9FVelz1FDo4bZ5OgFzECZvFHQ9dd4DH5vfMnxIcN-VRpZ4c1sW0XGAcps/s1043/bpstreet1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiB7hB8PwwkwiWaBnFy5UcXls1sCgt-JxlVsI1YoX6PHBsXHdq_qYzbpReKJh3-fq8k_-pBFpIqMzcqCsWMtopNr1QjW1hYKWXM2dyJ8TSUONFDOwqnEoPAxqJiRRoXE-xKhN9FVelz1FDo4bZ5OgFzECZvFHQ9dd4DH5vfMnxIcN-VRpZ4c1sW0XGAcps/w400-h388/bpstreet1.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>And even good voice acting slows everything down. I can read the text in maybe a quarter of the time it takes to listen to it. Cutting actors off mid-speech is jarring and anyway, if the acting is good, I feel I ought to keep it on and appreciate it, but even then I\'m often twitching to get on with things.&nbsp;<p></p><p>Only when the writing and the voice acting are both well above average, as for example in <i>Wuthering Waves</i>, does it feel like time well-spent to pay them each full attention. And as I\'ve said numerous times, that in itself is enervating.&nbsp;</p><p>Probably the main reason I play Wuthering Waves so infrequently is because the writing and voice acting are too good for what I want from that kind of video game. It\'s a level of quality that actually puts me off engaging with it because of the commitment it demands. I mean, if I wanted to watch a pretty good movie, I\'d do that instead.</p><p>For that reason, I was actively pleased to be able to go into the settings for BP:SR and switch NPC voices off. I couldn\'t understand them and the audio was carrying on long after I\'d finished reading the text, so it seemed like the obvious choice. I\'d rate the lack of English voices as at worst a neutral factor but probably a positive for the game as a whole. I kind of hope they never add them although by my own previous argument I guess I have to accept that it would be better to have the option.</p><p>How about the text, though? <i>Is </i>it badly translated? And those quests. <i>Are </i>they boring? The cut scenes, too. Is the only sensible choice to skip them?</p><p>No, no and no.&nbsp;</p><p>The dialog is well-translated, albeit with that odd lilt that\'s become so very familiar. It\'s idiomatic and grammatically correct and yet it still somehow has a slight off-kilter feel to it. And I like that. It\'s like hearing someone speak excellent English, only with a very slight, pleasant accent. What\'s the problem?</p><p>As for content, the quests are no more boring than any other quest in any other game of this stripe and considerably less boring than many. So far it\'s all been very standard stuff, although starting with the equivalent of half a dozen quests of the type you\'d normally find in an in-game holiday is a brave opening move.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the first half-hour of the game proper <i>is </i>a holiday event, to all intents and purposes. I\'m guessing that quite a bit of BP:SR is going to revolve around non-combat activities so it makes sense to introduce that style of gameplay early. I certainly enjoyed it.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju5hWMmQWMtiAi5XJtkqEPZF-ZOf14nffIIA98pv1weBrTwpofGRUVAl3wUyCWRjzDEa4AkBHqdEzKsw0Z8fP9DUBxnDw7OMxi5XYfGgqgFQDcV_rlgTTLGWUZP2Tv9OWTfqzzXgIys8Hak60fkYlHE_WEWwbazlMV4J3A2sF0j8n6acYhqu35o82YT9U/s1076/bppillar1.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju5hWMmQWMtiAi5XJtkqEPZF-ZOf14nffIIA98pv1weBrTwpofGRUVAl3wUyCWRjzDEa4AkBHqdEzKsw0Z8fP9DUBxnDw7OMxi5XYfGgqgFQDcV_rlgTTLGWUZP2Tv9OWTfqzzXgIys8Hak60fkYlHE_WEWwbazlMV4J3A2sF0j8n6acYhqu35o82YT9U/w392-h640/bppillar1.png" width="392" /></a></div>When the storyline does move on to killing mobs, first some harmless deer-creatures just outside the city and then some corrupted creatures and the aforementioned bad guy responsible for creating them, the quests involved are precisely what you\'d expect. They\'re wholly unoriginal and they very definitely aren\'t going to win any prizes.<p></p><p>But who would expect anything else? The dialog is sprightly and sparkling, the NPCs are quirky and <br />amusing, the stakes are low, the action is straightforward and we all had a jolly good time. Isn\'t that the what we\'re here for? It\'s a light-hearted video game, designed to be played in short bursts on a mobile phone, now also made available for the convenience and pleasure of PC users. What were you expecting?</p><p>I liked the quests. I liked the NPCs. I liked the dialog. I liked the story. I am clearly very easy to please and glad of it, too. So much better than the other way around.</p><p>As for the cut-scenes, there weren\'t many but they were fine. I didn\'t skip any nor feel the need to. You\'d need to be a lot more impatient than I am to find them too tedious to sit through. Or have much higher cultural and aesthetic standards, I suppose. In which case, I\'d politely ask you what the hell you thought you were doing when you downloaded this game.</p><p>And there we have it. The main reasons I\'ve seen for rubbishing Blue Protocol: Star Resonance, all comprehensively rubbished themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s not going to win any awards. It\'s not going to change the medium or even the genre. It\'s not going to challenge you or inspire you or bring you to some sort of emotional catharsis. If any of that is what you\'re looking for, there are plenty of other games that would suit you better.</p><p>This one is merely capable of entertaining and amusing in the moment, which is a lot more than nothing. It\'s also pretty to look at, fun to play and it has a welcome feel-good attitude. If that\'s what you want, you could do worse.

I\'ve only ever mentioned it two or three times here on the blog and not at all for a couple of years.&nbsp;</p><p>The most interested in it I ever sounded was <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2022/12/you-watch-too-much-tv-you-play-too-many.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">at the back end of 2022</span></a>, when it had been picked up by <i>Amazon Games </i>as the global publisher. At the time, I said I hadn\'t been planning on playing it, even though I knew there was a lot of hype around the title, but since I had an Amazon Games account already set up, it seemed it might be worth taking a look when it arrived.</p><p>It never did arrive, of course. Not through Amazon, anyway. That all fell through for reasons I\'m not sure I knew even while it was happening and certainly don\'t remember now. The game was released in Japan but didn\'t last long there, closing at the beginning of this year.</p><p>And that seemed to be the end of it. Until fairly recently, at least, when I started hearing rumblings about something called <i><a href="https://www.playbpsr.com/">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</a></i>.&nbsp; That seemed to be a mobile game at first but then it became apparent there was a PC version or a port or something. Reports on its progress drifted in, here and there, and in that way the name and my recognition of it were kept alive.</p><p> I didn\'t keep a mental note of when it was going to launch.&nbsp;I still had no special plans to play it but I did think maybe I\'d take a look when it arrived, if it was on Steam or something and I didn\'t have to make a new account. Same logic as when Amazon was going to be doing the paperwork, basically.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip_62RE1FXst6fNdjrFRQvba1hsm0jgf4p6dVOMzWLMwATunU0NOnqLEtouvnQmARKCbIrihgl8_AVLQEeabH1SgDGtTXOivgkNCzugyoGHQ4KxOUGImeGl3GuN7DYoYG41T0_P5JjdKC8hI3Kirh6rowsOwvnsEcPtHkmRlD6v4lalGKFTq9Ec2SO7PU/s1364/bpcc2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="316" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip_62RE1FXst6fNdjrFRQvba1hsm0jgf4p6dVOMzWLMwATunU0NOnqLEtouvnQmARKCbIrihgl8_AVLQEeabH1SgDGtTXOivgkNCzugyoGHQ4KxOUGImeGl3GuN7DYoYG41T0_P5JjdKC8hI3Kirh6rowsOwvnsEcPtHkmRlD6v4lalGKFTq9Ec2SO7PU/w400-h316/bpcc2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>Then earlier today I saw <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/10/09/anime-mmorpg-blue-protocol-star-resonance-makes-its-western-debut-on-pc-and-mobile/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">this news item</span></a> at <i>MassivelyOP</i>, just as I was wondering what I could find to write about today and I thought<i> there\'s</i> an idea...<p></p><p>I do enjoy doing First Impressions pieces. They\'re easy to write and they seem to go down quite well. Usually, I like at least to get through the tutorial before I do one but as I may have mentioned, opportunities to sit down and play three-hour gaming sessions and then spend three more hours turning them into detailed posts are pretty thin on the ground around here just now.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, today I had to drive to the next city over to do some stuff for my aged mother and tomorrow we have a bunch of workmen turning up at the crack of dawn to tear out the old heating system and start putting in a new one, so the first chance I\'m likely to get to give the game a decent shake will be Saturday.</p><p>But I can download it and make a character. That won\'t take three hours, will it?&nbsp;OK, I know there have been plenty of times in the past when doing something similar took at least that long but we\'re past that now, aren\'t we?&nbsp;</p><p>Nice tee-up for an anecdote about how it took three hours just to download the game and make a character there...</p><p>Except the download took about fifteen or twenty minutes and the game installed perfectly and I was able to log straight in and get stuck into making a character right away. Which was fun.</p><p><i>BP:SR</i> is referred to in everything I\'ve read about it as an "<i>anime MMORPG</i>", which could mean a lot of things. In this context, I often feel "<i>Anime</i>" means a look more than anything. I\'m not even sure what anime gameplay would be. There as many genres of anime as there are novels or Western games, aren\'t there? It could be scifi or fantasy or high school drama or historical or... well, anything.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEioc7-CUaLYMC0IxD9hgHfdlDArgGXH1wq7U12tfdguQqh1WrS1O_unz3tAGOY79gTgoF9XEiijem9qIMb064YnqyrMFD154Wr6pM3yQX2DIXbWGadZ2DomFUCOXVnQvaVCNIfWDzF-gSkAL5ln0qjHzemH5gjB5Hnz1jrfLoJ-5evX_CfoAjnWqbNLAkM/s1093/bpbt1.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="383" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEioc7-CUaLYMC0IxD9hgHfdlDArgGXH1wq7U12tfdguQqh1WrS1O_unz3tAGOY79gTgoF9XEiijem9qIMb064YnqyrMFD154Wr6pM3yQX2DIXbWGadZ2DomFUCOXVnQvaVCNIfWDzF-gSkAL5ln0qjHzemH5gjB5Hnz1jrfLoJ-5evX_CfoAjnWqbNLAkM/w400-h383/bpbt1.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>So that\'s not much to go on. Visually, though, anime does have a certain look and feel, regardless of the subject matter, and judging purely on Character Creation, which is almost all I\'ve seen of the game so far, this definitely <i>looks </i>like an anime MMORPG.<p></p><p>I really enjoyed making my character even though most of the text was untranslated from the original... Mandarin?&nbsp;</p><p><i>Sidebar:</i> I\'m going to look this up in a moment but I realize all of a sudden that I don\'t know if this is a Chinese or a Japanese game. I do know the only servers are in China because everyone outside South-East Asia has been complaining about it bitterly and review-bombing the game on Steam for it. On the other hand, every time I saw anything about the original Blue Protocol it always seemed to involve Japan somewhow, right up to the game launching, then closing, there and nowhere else.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Protocol:_Star_Resonance"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">On investigation</span></a>, it seems Blue Protocol itself was Japanese but Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is "<i>developed by Shanghai Bokura Network Technology and published by A Plus Japan</i>". So I guess it\'s Chinese <i>and </i>Japanese. That\'s cleared that up, then.</p><p>Whatever the language, in Character Creation all the pertinent parts have been translated and the icons <br />are more than adequate to explain the rest. Well, most of them. I was somewhat at a loss to figure out the meaning of the five symbols that show your character in a variety of poses when you click them but then again that part didn\'t seem to require any input from the player so it didn\'t really matter whether I understood them or not.</p><p>Character Creation starts with a choice of Body Type and Gender, although the word Gender isn\'t used and come to think of it I didn\'t click on the downard-pointing triangle. I just assumed it meant "<i>male</i>". Clearly I need to work on my assumptions some more.</p><p>The Body Type is labeled as such but it looks more like an age choice to me, with the options appearing to be Child, Adolescent and Adult. Or I guess they could be Petite, Slim and Well-Built. Depends how you look at it. I went for the middle option, whatever it\'s supposed to be.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzEMvvpKLACEmQNO1PxpKpctojrotANLi3EhkzKUWEycK-PREpdRjskzEKYHn1-FVOT-7a4MRo5heoVxM4J9ygAfuXXMKo4WBxQ7NIam4FV_YDHBNevU1G5dHK9azoJgagV9n30gQg1F7-bTyrO2sInohvSgrnXxfAmnFD8dk9xjxA1Ec9yq0f-Wsou_w/s1732/bpcc3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="318" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzEMvvpKLACEmQNO1PxpKpctojrotANLi3EhkzKUWEycK-PREpdRjskzEKYHn1-FVOT-7a4MRo5heoVxM4J9ygAfuXXMKo4WBxQ7NIam4FV_YDHBNevU1G5dHK9azoJgagV9n30gQg1F7-bTyrO2sInohvSgrnXxfAmnFD8dk9xjxA1Ec9yq0f-Wsou_w/w640-h318/bpcc3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>From there you get a fairly wide range of Presets and quite a few chances to fine-tune your facial appearance. There are no sliders, other than for color. It\'s all identikit mixing and matching, which I think I probably prefer to sliders.&nbsp;</p><p>Sliders are far more versatile and you can get much more nuanced results but you can also get sucked into some completely pointless, time-wasting rabbit holes as you try to get exactly the chin density or temple curvature you want, all the time forgetting that no matter how good it looks in Character Creation, you\'ll never see any of it ever again, once you log into the actual game. It\'s something of a relief just to pick from a menu and even then I found myself trying to make tiny adjustments that are never going to have any impact on my experience when I start playing the game proper.</p><p>I was in character creation for close on half an hour, something I can be reasonably sure of by my Steam played time of 35 minutes. The only other thing I did was watch the very short opening cut scene, then read a short note and put on my starting gear in the room where my character woke up after drowning or whatever it was that happened to her.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr1HLx7T7YQwPmILTzrVOzRHL-L9trm8TMJCEBBkUyvh4V07K9e1ut5hKUNDMfhT5nL7ED1PX8bYQEKmwiifzMRpTcmt1rIFQp_MYVGqA_brrtbHxu79GCWQZCyDL3n5TvLKBVMrlzt08ABobM3g3sXTPFE9hpHaAqZjMtgKjEabcVbvpgqR1iUddy7ws/s560/bpdog1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr1HLx7T7YQwPmILTzrVOzRHL-L9trm8TMJCEBBkUyvh4V07K9e1ut5hKUNDMfhT5nL7ED1PX8bYQEKmwiifzMRpTcmt1rIFQp_MYVGqA_brrtbHxu79GCWQZCyDL3n5TvLKBVMrlzt08ABobM3g3sXTPFE9hpHaAqZjMtgKjEabcVbvpgqR1iUddy7ws/w353-h400/bpdog1.jpg" width="353" /></a></div>Honestly, I don\'t know what happened. I wasn\'t paying attention because Mrs Bhagpuss came in in the middle of the cut scene and asked me a question and I turned round to answer her and neither saw nor heard what happened next, after my character dived down deep into the ocean.&nbsp;When I looked back at the screen, she was in a room somewhere.&nbsp;<p></p><p>All of that, including what I did when I got to the room, can\'t have taken much over five minutes, so the rest has to have been making the character. It didn\'t feel anything like that long, though, which is a strong point in favor of both the tools and the character design.</p><p>Oh, and I opened the claim window and got some freebies for pre-registering, which I never did, so I assume everyone gets them. One was a dog you can ride on. looking forward to trying that out.&nbsp;</p><p>Going back to the look of the thing, the character models certainly do scream "<i>anime</i>". There\'s no doubt about that. I didn\'t take any of them, but there are plenty of options to have the huge anime-style eyes and the many hair-styles all have that flick-away look that\'s so familiar. You even get to choose what your teeth look like, which I think may be a first for me.</p><p>Hair and eyes are always the two I spend most time on. There are a whole load of pupil choices, which for once actually look reasonable. That took me a while.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting the hair right took longer. You can just take a preset hairstyle but again you can mix and match from "<i>Front</i>", "<i>Back</i>" and "<i>Crown</i>" to get something a little less generic. I was curious about the Crown option. It turns out to be one or two strands of flyaway hair that stick up or out and wave about in the breeze. I toyed with the idea but I suspect it would become quite annoying after the novelty wore off so I settled for the neat and tidy look.&nbsp;</p><p>I have to keep calling her "<i>my character</i>" because one oddity of the process was that at no point did I get a chance to give her a name. I have come across that in other games. It usually means there\'s some point early on, where naming your character becomes a storyline choice, like when some official asks you to identify yourself or you have to sign some sort of document. We\'ll see if that happens next time I play.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5AdVye-zINhk4RBG40zFRtutJ2MbsMDCHJKN6xhx7-KoO17QAoQFLQMm84Z2qZUzCmb3-UU4pQPzg-WfzQUKOzBVRidln4X-93Si2GYRtqXzHJ2qL3KwWpl8_XGIJ1Ak5-bGYFbwyrCyusfI3nKfmq5lqyFlMibDvTLxgg_3qiTJ4D1esBbHPjY-0WP4/s1079/bproom1.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5AdVye-zINhk4RBG40zFRtutJ2MbsMDCHJKN6xhx7-KoO17QAoQFLQMm84Z2qZUzCmb3-UU4pQPzg-WfzQUKOzBVRidln4X-93Si2GYRtqXzHJ2qL3KwWpl8_XGIJ1Ak5-bGYFbwyrCyusfI3nKfmq5lqyFlMibDvTLxgg_3qiTJ4D1esBbHPjY-0WP4/w325-h400/bproom1.jpg" width="325" /></a></div>Which is also when I\'ll find out if the game has any stickiness I guess. I\'m hoping it may be at least as sticky as<i> Crystal of Atlan</i>, which I am theoretically, although not actually, still playing. I did get to about Level 50 or so in that one, which isn\'t nothing.<p></p><p>The last thing I did before the game dumped me into the opening cut scene was pick a class. There were quite a few to choose from. Maybe ten? I picked the ranged fighter that uses a bow and has a pet that fights for her because I always pick that one. And almost always regret it. The fighter with the giant sword is always more fun. I\'ll never learn.</p><p>All the classes get a difficulty rating. Mine was two stars out of five, so towards the easy end but not the easiest.

I\'ve only ever mentioned it two or three times here on the blog and not at all for a couple of years.&nbsp;</p><p>The most interested in it I ever sounded was <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2022/12/you-watch-too-much-tv-you-play-too-many.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">at the back end of 2022</span></a>, when it had been picked up by <i>Amazon Games </i>as the global publisher. At the time, I said I hadn\'t been planning on playing it, even though I knew there was a lot of hype around the title, but since I had an Amazon Games account already set up, it seemed it might be worth taking a look when it arrived.</p><p>It never did arrive, of course. Not through Amazon, anyway. That all fell through for reasons I\'m not sure I knew even while it was happening and certainly don\'t remember now. The game was released in Japan but didn\'t last long there, closing at the beginning of this year.</p><p>And that seemed to be the end of it. Until fairly recently, at least, when I started hearing rumblings about something called <i><a href="https://www.playbpsr.com/">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</a></i>.&nbsp; That seemed to be a mobile game at first but then it became apparent there was a PC version or a port or something. Reports on its progress drifted in, here and there, and in that way the name and my recognition of it were kept alive.</p><p> I didn\'t keep a mental note of when it was going to launch.&nbsp;I still had no special plans to play it but I did think maybe I\'d take a look when it arrived, if it was on Steam or something and I didn\'t have to make a new account. Same logic as when Amazon was going to be doing the paperwork, basically.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip_62RE1FXst6fNdjrFRQvba1hsm0jgf4p6dVOMzWLMwATunU0NOnqLEtouvnQmARKCbIrihgl8_AVLQEeabH1SgDGtTXOivgkNCzugyoGHQ4KxOUGImeGl3GuN7DYoYG41T0_P5JjdKC8hI3Kirh6rowsOwvnsEcPtHkmRlD6v4lalGKFTq9Ec2SO7PU/s1364/bpcc2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="316" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip_62RE1FXst6fNdjrFRQvba1hsm0jgf4p6dVOMzWLMwATunU0NOnqLEtouvnQmARKCbIrihgl8_AVLQEeabH1SgDGtTXOivgkNCzugyoGHQ4KxOUGImeGl3GuN7DYoYG41T0_P5JjdKC8hI3Kirh6rowsOwvnsEcPtHkmRlD6v4lalGKFTq9Ec2SO7PU/w400-h316/bpcc2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>Then earlier today I saw <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/10/09/anime-mmorpg-blue-protocol-star-resonance-makes-its-western-debut-on-pc-and-mobile/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">this news item</span></a> at <i>MassivelyOP</i>, just as I was wondering what I could find to write about today and I thought<i> there\'s</i> an idea...<p></p><p>I do enjoy doing First Impressions pieces. They\'re easy to write and they seem to go down quite well. Usually, I like at least to get through the tutorial before I do one but as I may have mentioned, opportunities to sit down and play three-hour gaming sessions and then spend three more hours turning them into detailed posts are pretty thin on the ground around here just now.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, today I had to drive to the next city over to do some stuff for my aged mother and tomorrow we have a bunch of workmen turning up at the crack of dawn to tear out the old heating system and start putting in a new one, so the first chance I\'m likely to get to give the game a decent shake will be Saturday.</p><p>But I can download it and make a character. That won\'t take three hours, will it?&nbsp;OK, I know there have been plenty of times in the past when doing something similar took at least that long but we\'re past that now, aren\'t we?&nbsp;</p><p>Nice tee-up for an anecdote about how it took three hours just to download the game and make a character there...</p><p>Except the download took about fifteen or twenty minutes and the game installed perfectly and I was able to log straight in and get stuck into making a character right away. Which was fun.</p><p><i>BP:SR</i> is referred to in everything I\'ve read about it as an "<i>anime MMORPG</i>", which could mean a lot of things. In this context, I often feel "<i>Anime</i>" means a look more than anything. I\'m not even sure what anime gameplay would be. There as many genres of anime as there are novels or Western games, aren\'t there? It could be scifi or fantasy or high school drama or historical or... well, anything.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEioc7-CUaLYMC0IxD9hgHfdlDArgGXH1wq7U12tfdguQqh1WrS1O_unz3tAGOY79gTgoF9XEiijem9qIMb064YnqyrMFD154Wr6pM3yQX2DIXbWGadZ2DomFUCOXVnQvaVCNIfWDzF-gSkAL5ln0qjHzemH5gjB5Hnz1jrfLoJ-5evX_CfoAjnWqbNLAkM/s1093/bpbt1.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="383" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEioc7-CUaLYMC0IxD9hgHfdlDArgGXH1wq7U12tfdguQqh1WrS1O_unz3tAGOY79gTgoF9XEiijem9qIMb064YnqyrMFD154Wr6pM3yQX2DIXbWGadZ2DomFUCOXVnQvaVCNIfWDzF-gSkAL5ln0qjHzemH5gjB5Hnz1jrfLoJ-5evX_CfoAjnWqbNLAkM/w400-h383/bpbt1.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>So that\'s not much to go on. Visually, though, anime does have a certain look and feel, regardless of the subject matter, and judging purely on Character Creation, which is almost all I\'ve seen of the game so far, this definitely <i>looks </i>like an anime MMORPG.<p></p><p>I really enjoyed making my character even though most of the text was untranslated from the original... Mandarin?&nbsp;</p><p><i>Sidebar:</i> I\'m going to look this up in a moment but I realize all of a sudden that I don\'t know if this is a Chinese or a Japanese game. I do know the only servers are in China because everyone outside South-East Asia has been complaining about it bitterly and review-bombing the game on Steam for it. On the other hand, every time I saw anything about the original Blue Protocol it always seemed to involve Japan somewhow, right up to the game launching, then closing, there and nowhere else.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Protocol:_Star_Resonance"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">On investigation</span></a>, it seems Blue Protocol itself was Japanese but Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is "<i>developed by Shanghai Bokura Network Technology and published by A Plus Japan</i>". So I guess it\'s Chinese <i>and </i>Japanese. That\'s cleared that up, then.</p><p>Whatever the language, in Character Creation all the pertinent parts have been translated and the icons <br />are more than adequate to explain the rest. Well, most of them. I was somewhat at a loss to figure out the meaning of the five symbols that show your character in a variety of poses when you click them but then again that part didn\'t seem to require any input from the player so it didn\'t really matter whether I understood them or not.</p><p>Character Creation starts with a choice of Body Type and Gender, although the word Gender isn\'t used and come to think of it I didn\'t click on the downard-pointing triangle. I just assumed it meant "<i>male</i>". Clearly I need to work on my assumptions some more.</p><p>The Body Type is labeled as such but it looks more like an age choice to me, with the options appearing to be Child, Adolescent and Adult. Or I guess they could be Petite, Slim and Well-Built. Depends how you look at it. I went for the middle option, whatever it\'s supposed to be.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzEMvvpKLACEmQNO1PxpKpctojrotANLi3EhkzKUWEycK-PREpdRjskzEKYHn1-FVOT-7a4MRo5heoVxM4J9ygAfuXXMKo4WBxQ7NIam4FV_YDHBNevU1G5dHK9azoJgagV9n30gQg1F7-bTyrO2sInohvSgrnXxfAmnFD8dk9xjxA1Ec9yq0f-Wsou_w/s1732/bpcc3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="318" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzEMvvpKLACEmQNO1PxpKpctojrotANLi3EhkzKUWEycK-PREpdRjskzEKYHn1-FVOT-7a4MRo5heoVxM4J9ygAfuXXMKo4WBxQ7NIam4FV_YDHBNevU1G5dHK9azoJgagV9n30gQg1F7-bTyrO2sInohvSgrnXxfAmnFD8dk9xjxA1Ec9yq0f-Wsou_w/w640-h318/bpcc3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>From there you get a fairly wide range of Presets and quite a few chances to fine-tune your facial appearance. There are no sliders, other than for color. It\'s all identikit mixing and matching, which I think I probably prefer to sliders.&nbsp;</p><p>Sliders are far more versatile and you can get much more nuanced results but you can also get sucked into some completely pointless, time-wasting rabbit holes as you try to get exactly the chin density or temple curvature you want, all the time forgetting that no matter how good it looks in Character Creation, you\'ll never see any of it ever again, once you log into the actual game. It\'s something of a relief just to pick from a menu and even then I found myself trying to make tiny adjustments that are never going to have any impact on my experience when I start playing the game proper.</p><p>I was in character creation for close on half an hour, something I can be reasonably sure of by my Steam played time of 35 minutes. The only other thing I did was watch the very short opening cut scene, then read a short note and put on my starting gear in the room where my character woke up after drowning or whatever it was that happened to her.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr1HLx7T7YQwPmILTzrVOzRHL-L9trm8TMJCEBBkUyvh4V07K9e1ut5hKUNDMfhT5nL7ED1PX8bYQEKmwiifzMRpTcmt1rIFQp_MYVGqA_brrtbHxu79GCWQZCyDL3n5TvLKBVMrlzt08ABobM3g3sXTPFE9hpHaAqZjMtgKjEabcVbvpgqR1iUddy7ws/s560/bpdog1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr1HLx7T7YQwPmILTzrVOzRHL-L9trm8TMJCEBBkUyvh4V07K9e1ut5hKUNDMfhT5nL7ED1PX8bYQEKmwiifzMRpTcmt1rIFQp_MYVGqA_brrtbHxu79GCWQZCyDL3n5TvLKBVMrlzt08ABobM3g3sXTPFE9hpHaAqZjMtgKjEabcVbvpgqR1iUddy7ws/w353-h400/bpdog1.jpg" width="353" /></a></div>Honestly, I don\'t know what happened. I wasn\'t paying attention because Mrs Bhagpuss came in in the middle of the cut scene and asked me a question and I turned round to answer her and neither saw nor heard what happened next, after my character dived down deep into the ocean.&nbsp;When I looked back at the screen, she was in a room somewhere.&nbsp;<p></p><p>All of that, including what I did when I got to the room, can\'t have taken much over five minutes, so the rest has to have been making the character. It didn\'t feel anything like that long, though, which is a strong point in favor of both the tools and the character design.</p><p>Oh, and I opened the claim window and got some freebies for pre-registering, which I never did, so I assume everyone gets them. One was a dog you can ride on. looking forward to trying that out.&nbsp;</p><p>Going back to the look of the thing, the character models certainly do scream "<i>anime</i>". There\'s no doubt about that. I didn\'t take any of them, but there are plenty of options to have the huge anime-style eyes and the many hair-styles all have that flick-away look that\'s so familiar. You even get to choose what your teeth look like, which I think may be a first for me.</p><p>Hair and eyes are always the two I spend most time on. There are a whole load of pupil choices, which for once actually look reasonable. That took me a while.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting the hair right took longer. You can just take a preset hairstyle but again you can mix and match from "<i>Front</i>", "<i>Back</i>" and "<i>Crown</i>" to get something a little less generic. I was curious about the Crown option. It turns out to be one or two strands of flyaway hair that stick up or out and wave about in the breeze. I toyed with the idea but I suspect it would become quite annoying after the novelty wore off so I settled for the neat and tidy look.&nbsp;</p><p>I have to keep calling her "<i>my character</i>" because one oddity of the process was that at no point did I get a chance to give her a name. I have come across that in other games. It usually means there\'s some point early on, where naming your character becomes a storyline choice, like when some official asks you to identify yourself or you have to sign some sort of document. We\'ll see if that happens next time I play.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5AdVye-zINhk4RBG40zFRtutJ2MbsMDCHJKN6xhx7-KoO17QAoQFLQMm84Z2qZUzCmb3-UU4pQPzg-WfzQUKOzBVRidln4X-93Si2GYRtqXzHJ2qL3KwWpl8_XGIJ1Ak5-bGYFbwyrCyusfI3nKfmq5lqyFlMibDvTLxgg_3qiTJ4D1esBbHPjY-0WP4/s1079/bproom1.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5AdVye-zINhk4RBG40zFRtutJ2MbsMDCHJKN6xhx7-KoO17QAoQFLQMm84Z2qZUzCmb3-UU4pQPzg-WfzQUKOzBVRidln4X-93Si2GYRtqXzHJ2qL3KwWpl8_XGIJ1Ak5-bGYFbwyrCyusfI3nKfmq5lqyFlMibDvTLxgg_3qiTJ4D1esBbHPjY-0WP4/w325-h400/bproom1.jpg" width="325" /></a></div>Which is also when I\'ll find out if the game has any stickiness I guess. I\'m hoping it may be at least as sticky as<i> Crystal of Atlan</i>, which I am theoretically, although not actually, still playing. I did get to about Level 50 or so in that one, which isn\'t nothing.<p></p><p>The last thing I did before the game dumped me into the opening cut scene was pick a class. There were quite a few to choose from. Maybe ten? I picked the ranged fighter that uses a bow and has a pet that fights for her because I always pick that one. And almost always regret it. The fighter with the giant sword is always more fun. I\'ll never learn.</p><p>All the classes get a difficulty rating. Mine was two stars out of five, so towards the easy end but not the easiest.

I\'m going to post something about <i>EverQuest II </i>again! Anyone would think I was trying to make some kind of point...<p></p><p>Nah, it\'s actually much simpler than that. I\'m not really playing anything else so if I\'m going to post about gaming, <i>EQII </i>is pretty much all I\'ve got. And I barely even have that, since about all I\'m doing most days is setting and collecting my <i>Overseer </i>missions, about which I am more than willing to complain yet again.</p><p>Seriously! What&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;</i>this thing? I\'ve been at it for what has to be most of the year and I\'m still waaaay off the cap, which I think is currently 70, although as always it\'s hard to be sure. If there\'s one thing the game needs more than <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/slackers-wannabes-and-chancers-need-not.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">an enhanced presence on social media</span></a>, it\'s some up-to-date, accurate, informative guides on the many, many abstruse and obfuscated systems that have been added over the years and only sporadically maintained or documented.</p><p>I have just now, as I started to do a little due diligence for this post, managed to find <a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/All_Overseer_Quests"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">this wiki page</span></a>, which has never turned up on any of the numerous searches I\'ve done, this year or before. It\'s very helpful. In fact, it includes a lot of highly pertinent detail that I wasn\'t aware anyone had made available anywhere, like the exact amount of Overseer XP you get from each, individual mission.</p><p>Not that that\'s particularly useful in any practical sense. It mostly confirms what I already believed, that you get more XP the higher the quality of the mission and that within each quality band, longer missions give more xp than shorter ones. I could have proved that for myself by taking note of the change in XP after I hand them in, of course, but that seemed like too much effort so I\'m happy someone else has done it for me.</p><p>There\'s not an awful lot I can do with the information now I have it, of course. All I can do is set the ten best missions available to me every day and those are exactly the ones I always thought they would be. I can - and do - stagger my picks through the day to let the better ones come off cooldown but that just tends to push my schedule off-center and lead to fewer choices the next day, so I\'m not convinced it\'s always worth the trouble.</p><p>I\'m still plugging away, as much out of stubborness as anything. At the rate it\'s going I\'m not convinced I\'ll be at the cap by the time the expansion arrives, although I\'ll be close. I\'m currently very close to the end of Overseer level 63. There\'s an Achievement at 65, for which you get nothing but the badge. The next tier - Tier 8 - doesn\'t exist yet but when it does, presumably when the expansion comes, it\'ll start at 71.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s another six levels, not counting 70 itself because the deciles always go at hyper-speed. I dinged 60 around the start of September and it\'s going faster now I have nearly all the missions for the tier, so I guess another two months \'til the expansion arrives might just about see it finished. I bloody hope so, anyway!</p><p>Speaking of the expansion, we know what it\'s called now. <i>Jenn Chan</i> issued a <i><a href="https://www.everquest2.com/news/eq2-producers-letter-october-2025"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Producer\'s Letter</span></a></i> yesterday. As usual, it goes hard on reviewing the past few months but only very lightly on what\'s coming next.</p><p>The name of EQII\'s twenty-second expansion is <i>Rage of Cthurath</i>.

I\'m going to post something about <i>EverQuest II </i>again! Anyone would think I was trying to make some kind of point...<p></p><p>Nah, it\'s actually much simpler than that. I\'m not really playing anything else so if I\'m going to post about gaming, <i>EQII </i>is pretty much all I\'ve got. And I barely even have that, since about all I\'m doing most days is setting and collecting my <i>Overseer </i>missions, about which I am more than willing to complain yet again.</p><p>Seriously! What&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;</i>this thing? I\'ve been at it for what has to be most of the year and I\'m still waaaay off the cap, which I think is currently 70, although as always it\'s hard to be sure. If there\'s one thing the game needs more than <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/slackers-wannabes-and-chancers-need-not.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">an enhanced presence on social media</span></a>, it\'s some up-to-date, accurate, informative guides on the many, many abstruse and obfuscated systems that have been added over the years and only sporadically maintained or documented.</p><p>I have just now, as I started to do a little due diligence for this post, managed to find <a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/All_Overseer_Quests"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">this wiki page</span></a>, which has never turned up on any of the numerous searches I\'ve done, this year or before. It\'s very helpful. In fact, it includes a lot of highly pertinent detail that I wasn\'t aware anyone had made available anywhere, like the exact amount of Overseer XP you get from each, individual mission.</p><p>Not that that\'s particularly useful in any practical sense. It mostly confirms what I already believed, that you get more XP the higher the quality of the mission and that within each quality band, longer missions give more xp than shorter ones. I could have proved that for myself by taking note of the change in XP after I hand them in, of course, but that seemed like too much effort so I\'m happy someone else has done it for me.</p><p>There\'s not an awful lot I can do with the information now I have it, of course. All I can do is set the ten best missions available to me every day and those are exactly the ones I always thought they would be. I can - and do - stagger my picks through the day to let the better ones come off cooldown but that just tends to push my schedule off-center and lead to fewer choices the next day, so I\'m not convinced it\'s always worth the trouble.</p><p>I\'m still plugging away, as much out of stubborness as anything. At the rate it\'s going I\'m not convinced I\'ll be at the cap by the time the expansion arrives, although I\'ll be close. I\'m currently very close to the end of Overseer level 63. There\'s an Achievement at 65, for which you get nothing but the badge. The next tier - Tier 8 - doesn\'t exist yet but when it does, presumably when the expansion comes, it\'ll start at 71.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s another six levels, not counting 70 itself because the deciles always go at hyper-speed. I dinged 60 around the start of September and it\'s going faster now I have nearly all the missions for the tier, so I guess another two months \'til the expansion arrives might just about see it finished. I bloody hope so, anyway!</p><p>Speaking of the expansion, we know what it\'s called now. <i>Jenn Chan</i> issued a <i><a href="https://www.everquest2.com/news/eq2-producers-letter-october-2025"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Producer\'s Letter</span></a></i> yesterday. As usual, it goes hard on reviewing the past few months but only very lightly on what\'s coming next.</p><p>The name of EQII\'s twenty-second expansion is <i>Rage of Cthurath</i>. I\'ll let you have a moment to think about that one. And to go get a drink of water if you\'ve been foolish enough to try and say it out loud.</p><p>The theme and setting of the expansion looks like it\'s Lovecraftian horror, which clearly explains the throat-mangling title, although when I saw it for the first time my immediate thought was "<i>Mmmm! Churros!</i>".&nbsp;</p><p>Here\'s the pitch:</p><p></p><blockquote><b><span style="font-size: medium;">"Our journey begins through entering a reality outside of our own, a boundless realm of entropy and madness, where mortal lives are often treated with excessive cruelty.

What the significance of the image might be I have no idea. It looks like Ice vs Fire but how that has anything to do with creating content beats me. I guess it might be a metaphor but if so I can\'t imagine how it would be a complimentary one. When fire and ice meet, all you get is a lot of steam.</p><p>The forum post itself contains a daunting amount of detail about the new program. A lot of it seemed slightly odd to me and some of it I felt almost verged on the passive-aggressive, as if whoever wrote it was anticipating people trying to blag their way onto the program without having the necessary bona fides. Then again, gamers, so...</p><p>The elevator pitch is that the program offers "<i>an official initiative by Daybreak Games to support and empower creators who bring the world of EQII to life.</i>" but when you read the whole thing it seems more like an attempt to spin up some social media presence, something the game is currently lacking, by handing out bribes.&nbsp;</p><p>Not a bad idea at all. What surprised me were the requirements for inclusion in the program, which seem <i>very </i>stringent, especially for a twenty year-old MMORPG with a relatively small player-base, and most especially in view of the way that player-base skews towards the upper end of the age scale, at least for online gaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, Angeliana is uncompromising in her determination to professionalize the enterprise. The whole things begins with this statement of intent:</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>"This is the first official round of the Creator Program. Spots are \nlimited, and while many applicants may meet the base requirements, \nacceptance is not guaranteed. We’re prioritizing active, engaged \ncreators who align with the goals of the program and can help us shape \nthe future of the EQII community."</b></span></blockquote><p></p><p>My first thought was to wonder if there would be enough interest to fill the available spots at all. The idea that there will be such a rush to join that spots need to be limited seems a little fanciful.&nbsp;How many EQII players even use social media, much less create it, I wonder? Is there really going to be <i>that </i>much competition for places?</p><p>Further down the announcement there are some quite specific entry requirements:</p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">"<i>Who can apply?</i><br /></span></b>\n</p><ul><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Creators aged 18+</span></b></li><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Content makers generating at least 15 pieces \nof content in the last 90 days across at least three categories \n(Streaming, Writing, Long-form Video, Short-form Video, Podcasting, \nSocial Reach)</span></b></li><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Must be in good standing in the <i>EverQuest II</i> community"</span></b></li></ul><p>Over 18s only is standard, of course, and being in "<i>good standing</i>" (I.e. not currently banned or suspended from the game.) makes perfect sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don\'t have an issue with any of that.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s the "<i>15 pieces of content in the last 90 days across at least three categories</i>" part that I find hard to rationalize. I mean, even as an either/or, it seems like a big barrier to entry but both?</p><p>And while it\'s very nice to see blogs included among social media. (It says "<i>writing</i>" in the above quote but elsewhere blogs are specifically mentioned.), who is out there writing blog posts, making videos&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>podcasting about <i>EQII </i>more than once a week? Anyone?

What the significance of the image might be I have no idea. It looks like Ice vs Fire but how that has anything to do with creating content beats me. I guess it might be a metaphor but if so I can\'t imagine how it would be a complimentary one. When fire and ice meet, all you get is a lot of steam.</p><p>The forum post itself contains a daunting amount of detail about the new program. A lot of it seemed slightly odd to me and some of it I felt almost verged on the passive-aggressive, as if whoever wrote it was anticipating people trying to blag their way onto the program without having the necessary bona fides. Then again, gamers, so...</p><p>The elevator pitch is that the program offers "<i>an official initiative by Daybreak Games to support and empower creators who bring the world of EQII to life.</i>" but when you read the whole thing it seems more like an attempt to spin up some social media presence, something the game is currently lacking, by handing out bribes.&nbsp;</p><p>Not a bad idea at all. What surprised me were the requirements for inclusion in the program, which seem <i>very </i>stringent, especially for a twenty year-old MMORPG with a relatively small player-base, and most especially in view of the way that player-base skews towards the upper end of the age scale, at least for online gaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, Angeliana is uncompromising in her determination to professionalize the enterprise. The whole things begins with this statement of intent:</p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>"This is the first official round of the Creator Program. Spots are \nlimited, and while many applicants may meet the base requirements, \nacceptance is not guaranteed. We’re prioritizing active, engaged \ncreators who align with the goals of the program and can help us shape \nthe future of the EQII community."</b></span></blockquote><p></p><p>My first thought was to wonder if there would be enough interest to fill the available spots at all. The idea that there will be such a rush to join that spots need to be limited seems a little fanciful.&nbsp;How many EQII players even use social media, much less create it, I wonder? Is there really going to be <i>that </i>much competition for places?</p><p>Further down the announcement there are some quite specific entry requirements:</p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">"<i>Who can apply?</i><br /></span></b>\n</p><ul><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Creators aged 18+</span></b></li><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Content makers generating at least 15 pieces \nof content in the last 90 days across at least three categories \n(Streaming, Writing, Long-form Video, Short-form Video, Podcasting, \nSocial Reach)</span></b></li><li><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Must be in good standing in the <i>EverQuest II</i> community"</span></b></li></ul><p>Over 18s only is standard, of course, and being in "<i>good standing</i>" (I.e. not currently banned or suspended from the game.) makes perfect sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don\'t have an issue with any of that.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s the "<i>15 pieces of content in the last 90 days across at least three categories</i>" part that I find hard to rationalize. I mean, even as an either/or, it seems like a big barrier to entry but both?</p><p>And while it\'s very nice to see blogs included among social media. (It says "<i>writing</i>" in the above quote but elsewhere blogs are specifically mentioned.), who is out there writing blog posts, making videos&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>podcasting about <i>EQII </i>more than once a week?

Not <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/wednesdays-child.html">the one</a></span> about <i>Wednesday </i>the show. The one I put up two days ago. The one that none of you have read.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, you <i>did </i>read it, did you? Congratulations! That puts you in quite the elite club. Want to know how to get into the club\'s super-secret, cool kids only treehouse? Click on the embedded <a href="https://youtu.be/_X1ONG28LBs"><span style="color: #04ff00;">video </span></a>in that post. If you\'re quick you could be the fifth person ever to see it!</p><p>I expect people not to watch the videos. Hardly anyone ever does. I can see how many times they\'ve been viewed on <i>YouTube </i>(And yes, I checked, and watching it on the blog does increment the YouTube counter.). The last one I did before this, for the post <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/some-puppy-walking.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Some Puppy Walking</span></a>,&nbsp; has been watched sixteen times. The post itself has over three hundred views so you do the math...</p><p>Three hundred views used to be bang on average for a post here, after it\'s been up for a week or more. So far, only forty-five people have viewed Wednesday\'s post, according to the little widget next to it in the post list in <i>Blogger</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s about the only stat I ever pay any attention to these days. I got very fed up with the unnecessary complexity of <i>Google Analytics</i>, so when they revamped it and you had to jump through a load of technical hoops to have your website included in the new version, I opted not to bother.</p><p>I also stopped looking at Blogger\'s own stats ages ago because they don\'t seem to filter out bots so they\'re always ludicrously inflated. Even the page-view number that I do still look at, mostly because it\'s always right there in front of me, is just the same number from the main stats, so I don\'t take it too seriously either.</p><p>Still, even bad stats are useful if they\'re consistent in their badness. Any sudden change means something must have happened. And there has been one heck of a big change just recently.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/s992/postcount1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="303" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/w400-h303/postcount1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Before Blaugust, that page view figure bobbled fairly consistently somewhere between 250 and 400 over the first seven days or so after the post published. Most posts stop picking up views after that although there can obviously be spikes at any time.<p></p><p>At this point, you\'re probably expecting me to say page views went up during Blaugust. That\'s always been the conventional wisdom and with this year having a record number of participants <i>and </i>with me consistently linking every post in the Blaugust Discord, it\'s more than reasonable to imagine it would hold true.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn\'t, though, or not for me. Most years I see little or no uptick in views from Blaugust and this year was much the same. Until the last week, that is.&nbsp;</p><p>From the 25th of August, page views almost doubled, averaging around seven or eight hundred. That bump carried on long after Blaugust ended and indeed became more pronounced as September went on, with quite a few posts hitting four figures, topping out at just over two thousand.</p><p>Why? No idea. I rarely have any clue why these things happen. And equally, I have no explanation for why they stop, which seems to be what\'s happened now. Only this time the drop is as spectacular as the rise was.</p><p>Generally, any post I put up gets most of its views in the first 24-48 hours, as you\'d expect. I haven\'t been keeping track but I\'m fairly sure back when they were finishing up with&nbsp; three or four hundred views, they\'d have seen half of those in the first two or three days.</p><p>The last two posts have so far managed 45 views in two days and 34 in 24 hours respectively. That doesn\'t seem normal to me, which is why this morning I started fiddling about in Google\'s stat cupboards to see if I could figure out what was going on.</p><p>I\'ll put you out of your suspense now.

If you have a Blogger blog, I\'d recommend giving it a look. It\'s much clearer, far&nbsp;easier to understand, and best of all it explains what the stats mean. You can set filters and use them to dig out some quite useful detail without a great deal of trouble.<p></p><p>I particularly liked the new <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/16308503"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Insights Report</span></a>, which gives you a very clear indication of which of your posts are trending up or down and enough granularity to take a shot at figuring out why. And that\'s where I noticed something very odd.</p><p>It wasn\'t that there\'d been a big spike in search requests for my post on housing in <i>Throne and Liberty</i>, which I put up just under a year ago. <i>T&amp;L</i> has just added housing so obviously people are googling for information on it, none of which they\'re going to find here.</p><p>It\'s harder to explain why there\'s been a surge of interest in <i>Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt</i>. If anything new is happening there, I\'ve missed it. Two of my posts about it do turn up on the first page of Google Search results though, so I guess if anyone is still interested, they might well give me a look.</p><p>The one that really set me thinking, though, was the sudden interest in&nbsp;<a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2024/09/stardust-memories-and-other-short.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">this post</span></a> from just over a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s a "<i>What I\'ve Been Listening To Lately</i>" post. No-one reads those. Okay, some people do, but clearly that series isn\'t going to come up in a general search very often. Yes, they do often have the names of famous people in the body of the post but hardly ever in the title and let\'s be realistic here - even putting <i>Taylor Swift</i>\'s name in the title of your blog post is not going to get you onto the first hundred pages on a search result, is it? I mean, there\'s a lot of competition there...</p><p>In the case of this particular post, I didn\'t mention Taylor Swift in the title (Although <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5URefVYaJrA"><span style="color: #04ff00;">A$AP Rocky\'s Taylor Swif </span></a></i>is one the featured tunes.) or anyone even close to being that famous. I did, as it happens, mention the name of a <i>Woody Allen </i>movie that doesn\'t even feature in the post at all, but that\'s not what people were searching for.</p><p>They were looking for a band called <i>X-Cetra,</i> a bunch of Californian tweenage girls who made a very odd album by the name of <i>Stardust </i>a couple of decades ago. I said in the post that X-Cetra didn\'t even have a Wikipedia page. I just checked and they still don\'t. I guess that explains why someone would bother to click through to a blog that mentioned them.</p><p>And they have. Not in the kind of numbers that click through to check on posts about clothes or housing in <i>Once Human</i>, which seem to be by far the biggest draw here over the last twelve months, but in numbers that feel statistically significant, especially since most of them appear to have happened not when I put the post up last year but in this last month.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/s1180/x-cetra%202.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="368" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1X5e2UltC29nkXHmyh430Pu0AyrbkgS0eoP4NI2ahoIRCl8lT5VaXg808sj2HxK2OEVUF5EAVcEa_OUuHbhkLAP2crT_b58mpg7qnNA3R3DaiYOyPRVNIwoV6PmzyWenhyItS7TjKrHlMgrX1KrSPP0BfX9UPZXVPbLYScQTyhv6cUdj0ZidAs_tKSMo/w640-h368/x-cetra%202.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><p>In fact, my top search query for September is "<i>X-cetra stardust</i>" and two more variations of the phrase are also in the top ten.

It may not sound like a great conversion rate but in comparison, of more than a thousand inquiries about housing in Throne &amp; Liberty, only nine people clicked.</p><p>What\'s even more interesting is that, of the 39 clicks from search the post has ever received, 38 of them were in the last month.

Yes, I know it\'s not Blaugust any more but always remember, a blog is not just for August.<p></p><p>It all started when I replied to <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/so-very-real.html?showComment=1759416282357#c3716573886534372536"><i>Tipa</i>\'s comment</a></span> on <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/so-very-real.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Wednesday\'s post</span></a>. Not <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/wednesdays-child.html">the one</a></span> about <i>Wednesday </i>the show. The one I put up two days ago. The one that none of you have read.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, you <i>did </i>read it, did you? Congratulations! That puts you in quite the elite club. Want to know how to get into the club\'s super-secret, cool kids only treehouse? Click on the embedded <a href="https://youtu.be/_X1ONG28LBs"><span style="color: #04ff00;">video </span></a>in that post. If you\'re quick you could be the fifth person ever to see it!</p><p>I expect people not to watch the videos. Hardly anyone ever does. I can see how many times they\'ve been viewed on <i>YouTube </i>(And yes, I checked, and watching it on the blog does increment the YouTube counter.). The last one I did before this, for the post <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/08/some-puppy-walking.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Some Puppy Walking</span></a>,&nbsp; has been watched sixteen times. The post itself has over three hundred views so you do the math...</p><p>Three hundred views used to be bang on average for a post here, after it\'s been up for a week or more. So far, only forty-five people have viewed Wednesday\'s post, according to the little widget next to it in the post list in <i>Blogger</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>That\'s about the only stat I ever pay any attention to these days. I got very fed up with the unnecessary complexity of <i>Google Analytics</i>, so when they revamped it and you had to jump through a load of technical hoops to have your website included in the new version, I opted not to bother.</p><p>I also stopped looking at Blogger\'s own stats ages ago because they don\'t seem to filter out bots so they\'re always ludicrously inflated. Even the page-view number that I do still look at, mostly because it\'s always right there in front of me, is just the same number from the main stats, so I don\'t take it too seriously either.</p><p>Still, even bad stats are useful if they\'re consistent in their badness. Any sudden change means something must have happened. And there has been one heck of a big change just recently.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/s992/postcount1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="303" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkzsQu2oyJgHWqqHVO97AsCmhQdbyBk6uR2DYvGHZn3P46gv2qKm3bTn_mcgWZ4cg4jB0hOiH4KC4f0GsSx0nJIe510fgOXYvjreUMSDafMv1dP99sV6TiSdpUtSv3pQY7zsVwmok1hfXdjvj3IiaCGBYA8NnRYatD4DAQZClIhC1XCK0LUqut6hyDjKQ/w400-h303/postcount1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Before Blaugust, that page view figure bobbled fairly consistently somewhere between 250 and 400 over the first seven days or so after the post published. Most posts stop picking up views after that although there can obviously be spikes at any time.<p></p><p>At this point, you\'re probably expecting me to say page views went up during Blaugust. That\'s always been the conventional wisdom and with this year having a record number of participants <i>and </i>with me consistently linking every post in the Blaugust Discord, it\'s more than reasonable to imagine it would hold true.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn\'t, though, or not for me. Most years I see little or no uptick in views from Blaugust and this year was much the same. Until the last week, that is.&nbsp;</p><p>From the 25th of August, page views almost doubled, averaging around seven or eight hundred. That bump carried on long after Blaugust ended and indeed became more pronounced as September went on, with quite a few posts hitting four figures, topping out at just over two thousand.</p><p>Why? No idea. I rarely have any clue why these things happen. And equally, I have no explanation for why they stop, which seems to be what\'s happened now. Only this time the drop is as spectacular as the rise was.</p><p>Generally, any post I put up gets most of its views in the first 24-48 hours, as you\'d expect. I haven\'t been keeping track but I\'m fairly sure back when they were finishing up with&nbsp; three or four hundred views, they\'d have seen half of those in the first two or three days.</p><p>The last two posts have so far managed 45 views in two days and 34 in 24 hours respectively. That doesn\'t seem normal to me, which is why this morning I started fiddling about in Google\'s stat cupboards to see if I could figure out what was going on.</p><p>I\'ll put you out of your suspense now. I did not figure out what was going on. I have no way of knowing whether regular readers have suddenly found better things to do or if Google has started tallying things differently. I\'ll just wait for it to change again, which it will.</p><p>I did, however, discover some other new and quite interesting things while I was rummaging and that\'s how this post came about.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/s1033/insights1.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="316" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1Doo_k1XEtjUlz2WW5SFuPYvkd0f7QFyFzbyaoBNAjovzzZweJfxzkRTmjdnFrIu1IV8PO8SR_GMo7w3OxOMxntuGHQ5mHrLLDchN_FIc0ITTug9wcPTV0HTh8muovX2K9Z179H3j8-EVMSIsSDkvG2b00nf2iGImJhvGpGwyUwc57DX6NqhQAT9tRh0/w400-h316/insights1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Firstly, I\'ll say that <i><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Google Search Console</span></a></i> is a huge improvement on Analytics for the casual user.

I realy like New World. It\'s my second most-played game on Steam, after <i>Valheim</i>. There\'s <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/season-10-nighthaven-announcement"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a major update</span></a> - you could almost call it an expansion - coming to the game in less than two weeks and it looks very interesting, all vampires and werewolves and spooky castles. Just right for the season</p><p>It\'s a free update but you have to have <i>New World Aeternum</i> to get it and I don\'t. So I\'d have to buy that, which would then give me even more new-to-me content. And contrary to what you might expect, that\'s actually a point against going back. I don\'t have the time or inclination to take on a big tranche of content in any game right now. I\'m looking for something to fill the odd session, here and there, not some big commitment that could take weeks.</p><p>Something like, oh, I don\'t know, a new solo dungeon or an instance I haven\'t done. Even better, one that might have some drops I could use. I\'ve always been a big advocate of the gameplay being its own reward but good drops are cake.</p><p>All of that led me back to <i>EQII</i>, where there have been two Game Updates this year that I haven\'t touched.&nbsp;</p><p>Alright, that\'s not entirely true. I did set foot in the new, contested dungeon that came in GU128 back in April. It didn\'t go well.</p><p>That update is called <i>Lure of Darkness</i> and features a large dungeon by the name of <i>Spiral of Vul</i>. It\'s designed for multiple groups to explore at the same time, old-school style, but it does have a small, soloable area at the front, as has been the norm in EQII as far back as beta.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/s1920/eq2totf3.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN4tfXcox81WtwEieUNof7mHzB1v2wJtHXrC6m6FiB8vlFzhwgJKQ5HYWQO5hPtHcCMNzhHjemEh6Zb4bdYJPaHKTLdtoCrxheqS1koUz1gtLTNvn2n8PIm_TqWvjI6MkUoQbmuCSzIaRY617f_wmYjAaHEwX0ZUJ6jBnuXruFm_aG-2Z9hYNBzwXS-j8/w640-h360/eq2totf3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>I can say from experience that the allocated area for solo players <i>is </i>soloable. I did a little bit of it back in April and I didn\'t die. I also didn\'t have much fun. The mobs were very tough and took ages to kill. If there are any soloable bosses, I never got far enough to try my luck with them. I did one quest, whch took about half an hour and gave up.</p><p>That was on my Berserker. Since then, I\'ve upgraded all his gear using the Anniversary gift. He was mostly in 475-495 Resolve gear then and now he\'s wearing all 525. Resolve is a very sound indicator of performance, much like Gear Score in other games, and 30-50 points is enough to make a difference so I was hopeful I might get a little further this time.</p><p>I did not. I map-hopped over to the <i>Sodden Archipelago</i> and flew halfway across the zone to the entrance of the dungeon, went inside and immediately picked up a couple of shinies that completed a collection. That made the trip worthwhile, which was just as well because the trash mobs seemed no easier to kill than before. I tried a couple, decided it wasn\'t going to be any more fun than last time, so I&nbsp; left.</p><p>The second of the annual updates arrived in August. It\'s called<i> Fear of Eternity</i> and consists of Fabled versions of the dungeons from the 2012 expansion, <i>Chains of Eternity</i>. Fabled dungeons are generally the same as the originals but with all the mobs revamped for the current level cap and all the loot similarly upgraded. They also come in all the regular flavors - Solo, Heroic I and Heroic II.</p><p>My experience with Fabled dungeons at the time they first appear has been patchy. There have been some I\'ve been able to make progress in but mostly they\'re too tough for me. I usually give them a go, decide it\'s too much like hard work and leave them for later. Sometimes I do come back and finish them when I\'m a bit tougher, sometimes I forget they exist.</p><p>I was fully expecting the first one I tried, <i>Fabled Temple of the Faceless</i>, to be at least as hard as Spiral of Vul. I mean, you\'d think so, woudn\'t you? It\'s six months later, after all. What would be the point of adding something easier to the game at level cap?</p><p>It <i>was </i>easier. It was a lot easier. At least it was once I got myself sorted out.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/s639/eq2tofs2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/w400-h388/eq2tofs2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>The zone-in is much more conveniently placed, right on the dock where you zone in to Sodden Archipelago. No flying right across the map this time. That was nice. You can access all the available dungeons from the update from the same portal, too. Also nice.<p></p><p>I picked the first instance on the list, zoned in and pulled a mob to test the waters. They were warm. The mob, a three-up arrow spider, theoretically tough for trash, died in a reasonable time and didn\'t pose much of&nbsp; threat. I worked my across the opening area towards the first boss, killing as I went and it felt comfortable. It wasn\'t a walkover but it wasn\'t a grind. I felt like I was moving through the zone at a reasonable pace.</p><p>I got in range of the boss and thought about looking him up for strats but I couldn\'t be bothered so I just pulled him to see what would happen. Nothing much. In fact, as far as he was concerned, nothing at all. His health stayed solidly at 100% no matter how hard and how often I hit him. Clearly there were unseen factors in play.</p><p>With my merc pumping out the healing and the Berserker having a pretty solid self-healing capacity of his own it was a stalemate, albeit one that was eventually only going to end one way, even if it was likely to take an hour to get there. I rummaged in my bags for a <i>Totem of Escape</i> to port myself to the zone entrance and couldn\'t find one so I just legged it to the zone-line with the boss beating on me all the way. He still didn\'t make much of a dent, even with my back turned.</p><p>Once I was safe outside, I looked at the wiki. It turns out there are two pillars, one in each of two side-temples, that have to be destroyed before the first boss can be damaged. I vaguely remembered that from whenever I did the dungeon when I was questing through the relevant expansion but that was years ago and I needed to be reminded.</p><p>I went back in, found the pillars, knocked them down, then had a second go at the boss. It went much better that time.&nbsp;</p><p>I was curious to see what he\'d drop. I was hoping it would be gear over 500 Resolve. In fact it was identical in quality to the Anniversary freebies - 525 Resolve. Since I was already fully kitted out in that, I was also hoping it wouldn\'t be Plate Armor. I could give that to my Inquisitor but she\'s not Level 130 yet so she\'d have to do five more levels before she could wear it.</p><p>I was hoping for cloth so my Necro could have it and cloth was what I got. On the first boss, anyway.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/s1249/eq2totf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/w640-h302/eq2totf1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>It had been fun and profitable so far so I carried on. Temple of The Faceless is a fairly compact, to the point dungeon, without a lot of wandering about required. Exactly what I was looking for. I progressed through the next two bosses, checking strats just in case of any more surprises but having very little trouble with either.</p><p>That took me up to bedtime so I camped where I was and picked up again where I left off the next morning. There was only one more boss left but it was a dragon and they can be tricky. In the event, though, he went down as easily as the rest.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn\'t get any more cloth armor but my Bruiser is going to be happy. The rest was all leather. The two sessions were fun, the difficulty just about right for me, requiring a certain amount of attention and concentration but not so much I couldn\'t take a few screenshots during the fights.</p><p>There are several more Fabled instances in the update so I\'ll most likely take a look at those next. The deciding factor on whether I do or not will be how much fun I\'m having. The upgraded loot is nice but I\'m all too aware it will be made obsolete by the free handouts at the start of the coming expansion, let alone the quest rewards from the storyline.</p><p>Not to mention there\'s the stuff the pandas are handing out. Which reminds me. As of this week\'s reset, I must have a new panda quest to do...</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBJOyn_Pz0YPxTzbK92J9KR38Y5hmxD8PRKjE6FYzafmUwlwzS-v3HN5uXn_Qi8w04K648eADQE7zrryeMz6DHr5NZr-vOXdMydJ_Lb3EAwPKu-DaxVoPxOqINCDTwQi4y3Ft19Hnw6t7HOeS_qNBRYXyoHaQ27rJDAWR_J8OpHmq3BU7X2T3NN3BC-Us/s1418/eq2templered1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="362" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBJOyn_Pz0YPxTzbK92J9KR38Y5hmxD8PRKjE6FYzafmUwlwzS-v3HN5uXn_Qi8w04K648eADQE7zrryeMz6DHr5NZr-vOXdMydJ_Lb3EAwPKu-DaxVoPxOqINCDTwQi4y3Ft19Hnw6t7HOeS_qNBRYXyoHaQ27rJDAWR_J8OpHmq3BU7X2T3NN3BC-Us/w640-h362/eq2templered1.jpg" width="640" /></a>Yesterday evening and again this morning, I did something unusual.

Since then, I\'ve upgraded all his gear using the Anniversary gift. He was mostly in 475-495 Resolve gear then and now he\'s wearing all 525. Resolve is a very sound indicator of performance, much like Gear Score in other games, and 30-50 points is enough to make a difference so I was hopeful I might get a little further this time.</p><p>I did not. I map-hopped over to the <i>Sodden Archipelago</i> and flew halfway across the zone to the entrance of the dungeon, went inside and immediately picked up a couple of shinies that completed a collection. That made the trip worthwhile, which was just as well because the trash mobs seemed no easier to kill than before. I tried a couple, decided it wasn\'t going to be any more fun than last time, so I&nbsp; left.</p><p>The second of the annual updates arrived in August. It\'s called<i> Fear of Eternity</i> and consists of Fabled versions of the dungeons from the 2012 expansion, <i>Chains of Eternity</i>. Fabled dungeons are generally the same as the originals but with all the mobs revamped for the current level cap and all the loot similarly upgraded. They also come in all the regular flavors - Solo, Heroic I and Heroic II.</p><p>My experience with Fabled dungeons at the time they first appear has been patchy. There have been some I\'ve been able to make progress in but mostly they\'re too tough for me. I usually give them a go, decide it\'s too much like hard work and leave them for later. Sometimes I do come back and finish them when I\'m a bit tougher, sometimes I forget they exist.</p><p>I was fully expecting the first one I tried, <i>Fabled Temple of the Faceless</i>, to be at least as hard as Spiral of Vul. I mean, you\'d think so, woudn\'t you? It\'s six months later, after all. What would be the point of adding something easier to the game at level cap?</p><p>It <i>was </i>easier. It was a lot easier. At least it was once I got myself sorted out.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/s639/eq2tofs2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4OTE3aUouSMwzUxvYOwqwEEKW2-EQSPihUHanr_N2GmwnLJ4zOm9dWbHzt1BvYTCxU7g6iTTF0q7ioFMlYTkrwFvSz346iZPeLc4VJ7d11hcrLBYCRpcoGitVsCelCgGX2rSPihMGCNAiqAcvbbuFZQtsECubQ0Lx9wZKOzDMPLqZIaN-SV61CPnXrhY/w400-h388/eq2tofs2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>The zone-in is much more conveniently placed, right on the dock where you zone in to Sodden Archipelago. No flying right across the map this time. That was nice. You can access all the available dungeons from the update from the same portal, too. Also nice.<p></p><p>I picked the first instance on the list, zoned in and pulled a mob to test the waters. They were warm. The mob, a three-up arrow spider, theoretically tough for trash, died in a reasonable time and didn\'t pose much of&nbsp; threat. I worked my across the opening area towards the first boss, killing as I went and it felt comfortable. It wasn\'t a walkover but it wasn\'t a grind. I felt like I was moving through the zone at a reasonable pace.</p><p>I got in range of the boss and thought about looking him up for strats but I couldn\'t be bothered so I just pulled him to see what would happen. Nothing much. In fact, as far as he was concerned, nothing at all. His health stayed solidly at 100% no matter how hard and how often I hit him. Clearly there were unseen factors in play.</p><p>With my merc pumping out the healing and the Berserker having a pretty solid self-healing capacity of his own it was a stalemate, albeit one that was eventually only going to end one way, even if it was likely to take an hour to get there. I rummaged in my bags for a <i>Totem of Escape</i> to port myself to the zone entrance and couldn\'t find one so I just legged it to the zone-line with the boss beating on me all the way. He still didn\'t make much of a dent, even with my back turned.</p><p>Once I was safe outside, I looked at the wiki. It turns out there are two pillars, one in each of two side-temples, that have to be destroyed before the first boss can be damaged. I vaguely remembered that from whenever I did the dungeon when I was questing through the relevant expansion but that was years ago and I needed to be reminded.</p><p>I went back in, found the pillars, knocked them down, then had a second go at the boss. It went much better that time.&nbsp;</p><p>I was curious to see what he\'d drop. I was hoping it would be gear over 500 Resolve. In fact it was identical in quality to the Anniversary freebies - 525 Resolve. Since I was already fully kitted out in that, I was also hoping it wouldn\'t be Plate Armor. I could give that to my Inquisitor but she\'s not Level 130 yet so she\'d have to do five more levels before she could wear it.</p><p>I was hoping for cloth so my Necro could have it and cloth was what I got. On the first boss, anyway.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/s1249/eq2totf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKCBn23qoflNDHlvBjJplvg7xXzCl0NORhVhVW2e_cz_1WBudQgkNmO_ZLRMEPigY2y1-jJFczLiCdZWJUxYfyHnzSi1DAgDLHaidLxsJ8P0hOmUrBdaGhYM4ynYN-2EifGFt1vYJyI9-8IQOGrt4B-85cqWrboSFi-HjlsN_EEtg5PD01gJIQXb5qPVw/w640-h302/eq2totf1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>It had been fun and profitable so far so I carried on. Temple of The Faceless is a fairly compact, to the point dungeon, without a lot of wandering about required. Exactly what I was looking for. I progressed through the next two bosses, checking strats just in case of any more surprises but having very little trouble with either.</p><p>That took me up to bedtime so I camped where I was and picked up again where I left off the next morning. There was only one more boss left but it was a dragon and they can be tricky. In the event, though, he went down as easily as the rest.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn\'t get any more cloth armor but my Bruiser is going to be happy. The rest was all leather. The two sessions were fun, the difficulty just about right for me, requiring a certain amount of attention and concentration but not so much I couldn\'t take a few screenshots during the fights.</p><p>There are several more Fabled instances in the update so I\'ll most likely take a look at those next. The deciding factor on whether I do or not will be how much fun I\'m having. The upgraded loot is nice but I\'m all too aware it will be made obsolete by the free handouts at the start of the coming expansion, let alone the quest rewards from the storyline.</p><p>Not to mention there\'s the stuff the pandas are handing out. Which reminds me. As of this week\'s reset, I must have a new panda quest to do...</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/facing-off-with-faceless.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/10/facing-off-with-faceless.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBJOyn_Pz0YPxTzbK92J9KR38Y5hmxD8PRKjE6FYzafmUwlwzS-v3HN5uXn_Qi8w04K648eADQE7zrryeMz6DHr5NZr-vOXdMydJ_Lb3EAwPKu-DaxVoPxOqINCDTwQi4y3Ft19Hnw6t7HOeS_qNBRYXyoHaQ27rJDAWR_J8OpHmq3BU7X2T3NN3BC-Us/s72-w640-h362-c/eq2templered1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

I finally ran out of things I\nwrote or recorded in the 70s, 80s and 90s that I could refashion or remake into\nnew songs using AI. It\'s taken me more than six months, hacking away at the past\na little more every day, but now it\'s clear cut and there\'s nothing left but\nstumps.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Well, okay, not exactly. I could give the longer pieces another pass or two.\n  See if there\'s anything I missed. I didn\'t really pry all that much away from\n  the longer of the two extended pieces of fiction because most of it seemed\n  unsuitable for conversion into song lyrics but maybe a different musical genre\n  would shake something else loose. Everything can\'t be sad dreampop.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And there might be the odd fragment I haven\'t found, left lurking somewhere in\n  the house. I can think of a couple of pieces I remember writing that haven\'t\n  turned up yet. One of them would be perfect. But if they still exist, I\'ve run\n  out of ideas on where to look. They weren\'t in the loft and that was my last\n  hope.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or maybe not. There are a couple of outside possibilities. I doubt very much\n  that I\'m likely to find any of the printed zines but I have a couple of PC\n  floppy disks I haven\'t been able to read. If I could get into those...&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUFcYPzNomdYhN9i6T9YmCgT6-E_ztXasCueZBId2mbEQNCy-vq7v26t_xsJTC4EhmnYf1_oiJL7CJp-CP5PALIg2D4LdZQDcyfKLiosvcQQXeBDR0T6oCd4TfpnSlG2ZDXgJtou2y7j-CmionHjttFbMBG2qRvEppPp6ooYoGOgdKZOPodiVqSQD0ARk/s4080/20250901_165045.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUFcYPzNomdYhN9i6T9YmCgT6-E_ztXasCueZBId2mbEQNCy-vq7v26t_xsJTC4EhmnYf1_oiJL7CJp-CP5PALIg2D4LdZQDcyfKLiosvcQQXeBDR0T6oCd4TfpnSlG2ZDXgJtou2y7j-CmionHjttFbMBG2qRvEppPp6ooYoGOgdKZOPodiVqSQD0ARk/w300-h400/20250901_165045.jpg" width="300" /></a>\n</div>\nAnd before I got the PC in the mid-90s I\'m pretty sure I wrote everything on my\nAmiga 500. Which I still have. And the disks. The problem there is that I\'d need\na CRT monitor to plug the Amiga into and I got rid of the last of those just\nafter the pandemic, when I was having a clear-out. One more piece of evidence to\nsupport my belief that decluttering is never a good idea.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was looking into it and it seems you can get various adapters to connect an\n  Amiga to an HDMI display but my experience with such things in the past has\n  not always been great and honestly I don\'t think I can be bothered. If I\'m\n  honest, I don\'t even want to dig the Amiga out from the inaccessible\n  hidey-hole I buried it in when I was almost sure I\'d never want to use it\n  again...\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, I think I\'m just going to have to accept that those last, few fragments\n  are gone for good. And that\'s okay. I\'ve recovered and restored a huge\n  percentage of everything I ever did, most of which I thought I\'d never see\n  again and none of which I ever imagined would have such a scintillating\n  afterlife.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s been a revelation, rediscovering eveything I wrote and recorded decades\n  ago, finding much of it was far better than I remembered and then turning it\n  all into something new that\'s given me an extraordinary amount of pleasure and\n  satisfaction in its own right. I think it\'s okay to let a few scraps fall\n  through the floorboards.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There is another very good reason to call a halt to the crate-digging, too. If\n  I don\'t have any more old stuff to rely on, I\'ll have to start making some\n  new. That would be a whole different adventure, wouldn\'t it?\n</p>\n<p>\n  I probably ought to start by finishing the pieces I left unfinished back\n  around the turn of the millennium. One, supposedly a novel, I stopped mostly\n  because I didn\'t know where to go with it next. The other, an episodic string\n  of vignettes, left off, as I now realize, at a very unhappy moment in the\n  story.&nbsp;Both of those deserve proper endings.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After that, maybe I might even come up with a new idea. That\'d be the first\n  this century. I don\'t believe I\'ve had a new idea since the mid-90s. I\'m\n  assuming they still exist. It might be a myth.\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqM_qB_5MUk1umW7nyA57PBI1DHy5_B_or14xVa7ClQPyH0pErluPO4kfgJIzXLuI0NiZhyphenhyphenflcHiJVg62zoNq-oGlrqTMU5xjIJrcq5aQ4OZXHasOCW43x69pD_T5DaRNCtZ4mnJSEfCC1HfQl1zLMZW4KfG65E90kcNFHiDnk3oqLIATx1IOf4FvWnPI/s4080/20250901_165055.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqM_qB_5MUk1umW7nyA57PBI1DHy5_B_or14xVa7ClQPyH0pErluPO4kfgJIzXLuI0NiZhyphenhyphenflcHiJVg62zoNq-oGlrqTMU5xjIJrcq5aQ4OZXHasOCW43x69pD_T5DaRNCtZ4mnJSEfCC1HfQl1zLMZW4KfG65E90kcNFHiDnk3oqLIATx1IOf4FvWnPI/w300-h400/20250901_165055.jpg" width="300" /></a>\n</div>\n  New ideas are scary, though, and so is making art. Curating it is a lot more\n  comfortable. Perhaps I\'d have a better time organizing what I already have and\n  figuring out some way to present it in public. Not that I have any illusions\n  there\'s a public out there likely to take an interest but I figure it\'s better\n  to offer it than not, even if there are no takers.\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  That\'s a thought that deserves some analysis, isn\'t it? Why does any creative\n  act <i>need </i>to be shared? Surely the act of creation is sufficient in\n  itself. And if an audience <i>is </i>required, <i>I </i>am it. I mean, I\n  really appreciate my own work. In making it public, would I be sharing it in a\n  spirit of benevolence, offering up something I feel is valuable and worthwhile\n  for the pleasure and entertainment of others? Or would I just be looking for\n  validation and applause?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Yeah, I don\'t really care much about all that introspective nonsense. Mostly,\n  I\'d like it on the web because that maximizes its chances of survival over a\n  longer time-frame and I\'m broadly of the opinion that things should persist\n  whenever possible. Besides, someone might get some use or pleasure out of it\n  one day. Also, it\'d be really convenient for me to have it all in one place,\n  even if that was actually several places, as in multiple blogs or websites,\n  with the "<i>one place</i>" in that scenario being the collective wrapper of\n  the internet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As you may have realized by now, those who\'ve stayed with me this far, this\n  isn\'t so much a blog post as a conversation I\'m having with myself as I try to\n  decide what to do next. Coming to the end of the ongoing project I\'ve been\n  engaged with for most of this year has unsettled me a little and this is me,\n  trying to think it through and figure out what comes next.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And do you know what comes next right now? You won\'t guess. I\'ll tell\n  you.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m going to go into the bedroom, open the door to the cupboard where the hot\n  water tank is and rummage through the shelves beneath it, where I keep all the\n  very old clothes I\'m never going to wear again but haven\'t gotten as far as\n  throwing out yet. I\'m hoping that among them I\'ll find a T--shirt I bought in\n  Antequerra about thirty years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That T-shirt, which got too small and old to wear decades ago, has a cartoon\n  on the front of five young women. They aren\'t characters from a comic or a\n  movie or a show. They\'re just five people someone drew and presumably sold to\n  someone else, who turned the image into a piece of clothing that ended up in a\n  shop in a backstreet of a middle-sized town in Andalusia, where I found it and\n  bought it for no reason other than I liked the look of the characters.\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>And then, later, I gave them all names and wrote a story about them. Which is\n  one of the pieces that so far hasn\'t come to light.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t really think seeing the image again will bring any of the names I gave\n  them back to me. Except I already know what one of them is called because she\n  turns up as a character in that series of vignettes I<i>&nbsp;</i>mentioned.\n</p>\n<p>\n  She\'s called Cat and I\'m hoping if I can find the shirt I\'ll remember which of\n  the five she is. So let me just go see if I can find it...\n</p>\n<p>\n  ... and no, I can\'t. I have, however, discovered the hot water tank is rusting\n  and needs to be replaced immediately, so that was... lucky?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Also, a reminder that there are things more pressing in life than either\n  writing blog posts or worrying about what happened to short stories you wrote\n  half a lifetime ago. And with that I think I\'ll go do something useful for a\n  change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Notes on AI used in this post</span></b></p><p>Just the music, which was created using&nbsp;<i>Suno </i>from a guide vocal uploaded by me. Actually, I whistled the tune. Mostly I sing them but some days my voice just isn\'t willing to co-operate and that apparently was one of those days.&nbsp;</p><p>All the lyrics are mine, adapted from the penultimate paragraph, which reads as follows:</p><p>"<i>Rachel sometimes does fireworks for us, just as it gets dark, and I help with the snow statues. If I feel lonely she\'ll hold me, if I ask. When I\'m tired I go up to my little room and close the door. I think Rachel has a room somewhere, but I\'ve never seen it, Rachel is very real. Perhaps she\'s the real one, not me. Cat and Cathy, I don\'t know where they go. They\'re ghosts.</i>"</p><p>As you can see, I didn\'t change much, just added some emphasis and extra poignancy. I\'ve found the two techniques that work best for turning prose into lyrics are either to add a few rhymes or to use repetition. It\'s amazing how effectively repeated lines and phrases substitute for rhymes.</p><p>I ran lots of variations and fiddled around with them but in the end, the best one was the very first run. It happens that way more often than you\'d think. Suno sometimes seems to get worse the more you ask it to iterate.&nbsp;</p><p>The prompt was</p><p>&nbsp;"<span><i>strings, </i><span><i>cello, </i><span><i>soft, </i><span><i>sweet, </i><span><i>low, </i><span><i>husky female vocals, </i><span><i>Gentle, </i><span><i>soft, </i><span><i>quiet, </i><span><i>restrained, </i><span><i>understated chamber-pop soundscape throughout, </i><span><i>production very crisp and clear, </i><span><i>female vocals low and husky but soft and sweet, </i><span><i>Pitch is generally low, </i><span><i>a somber quality  indie-pop, </i><span><i>dreampop fuzz-pop, </i><span><i>simple subdued drums, </i><span><i>quiet simple bass, </i><span><i>quiet fuzzed guitars, </i><span><i>strings</i><span><span><span>"</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Again, I find repeating things, particularly at the beginning and end of a prompt, helps a lot.

It\'s taken me more than six months, hacking away at the past\na little more every day, but now it\'s clear cut and there\'s nothing left but\nstumps.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Well, okay, not exactly. I could give the longer pieces another pass or two.\n  See if there\'s anything I missed. I didn\'t really pry all that much away from\n  the longer of the two extended pieces of fiction because most of it seemed\n  unsuitable for conversion into song lyrics but maybe a different musical genre\n  would shake something else loose. Everything can\'t be sad dreampop.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And there might be the odd fragment I haven\'t found, left lurking somewhere in\n  the house. I can think of a couple of pieces I remember writing that haven\'t\n  turned up yet. One of them would be perfect. But if they still exist, I\'ve run\n  out of ideas on where to look. They weren\'t in the loft and that was my last\n  hope.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or maybe not. There are a couple of outside possibilities. I doubt very much\n  that I\'m likely to find any of the printed zines but I have a couple of PC\n  floppy disks I haven\'t been able to read. If I could get into those...&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUFcYPzNomdYhN9i6T9YmCgT6-E_ztXasCueZBId2mbEQNCy-vq7v26t_xsJTC4EhmnYf1_oiJL7CJp-CP5PALIg2D4LdZQDcyfKLiosvcQQXeBDR0T6oCd4TfpnSlG2ZDXgJtou2y7j-CmionHjttFbMBG2qRvEppPp6ooYoGOgdKZOPodiVqSQD0ARk/s4080/20250901_165045.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUFcYPzNomdYhN9i6T9YmCgT6-E_ztXasCueZBId2mbEQNCy-vq7v26t_xsJTC4EhmnYf1_oiJL7CJp-CP5PALIg2D4LdZQDcyfKLiosvcQQXeBDR0T6oCd4TfpnSlG2ZDXgJtou2y7j-CmionHjttFbMBG2qRvEppPp6ooYoGOgdKZOPodiVqSQD0ARk/w300-h400/20250901_165045.jpg" width="300" /></a>\n</div>\nAnd before I got the PC in the mid-90s I\'m pretty sure I wrote everything on my\nAmiga 500. Which I still have. And the disks. The problem there is that I\'d need\na CRT monitor to plug the Amiga into and I got rid of the last of those just\nafter the pandemic, when I was having a clear-out. One more piece of evidence to\nsupport my belief that decluttering is never a good idea.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was looking into it and it seems you can get various adapters to connect an\n  Amiga to an HDMI display but my experience with such things in the past has\n  not always been great and honestly I don\'t think I can be bothered. If I\'m\n  honest, I don\'t even want to dig the Amiga out from the inaccessible\n  hidey-hole I buried it in when I was almost sure I\'d never want to use it\n  again...\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, I think I\'m just going to have to accept that those last, few fragments\n  are gone for good. And that\'s okay. I\'ve recovered and restored a huge\n  percentage of everything I ever did, most of which I thought I\'d never see\n  again and none of which I ever imagined would have such a scintillating\n  afterlife.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s been a revelation, rediscovering eveything I wrote and recorded decades\n  ago, finding much of it was far better than I remembered and then turning it\n  all into something new that\'s given me an extraordinary amount of pleasure and\n  satisfaction in its own right. I think it\'s okay to let a few scraps fall\n  through the floorboards.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There is another very good reason to call a halt to the crate-digging, too. If\n  I don\'t have any more old stuff to rely on, I\'ll have to start making some\n  new. That would be a whole different adventure, wouldn\'t it?\n</p>\n<p>\n  I probably ought to start by finishing the pieces I left unfinished back\n  around the turn of the millennium. One, supposedly a novel, I stopped mostly\n  because I didn\'t know where to go with it next. The other, an episodic string\n  of vignettes, left off, as I now realize, at a very unhappy moment in the\n  story.&nbsp;Both of those deserve proper endings.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After that, maybe I might even come up with a new idea. That\'d be the first\n  this century. I don\'t believe I\'ve had a new idea since the mid-90s. I\'m\n  assuming they still exist. It might be a myth.\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqM_qB_5MUk1umW7nyA57PBI1DHy5_B_or14xVa7ClQPyH0pErluPO4kfgJIzXLuI0NiZhyphenhyphenflcHiJVg62zoNq-oGlrqTMU5xjIJrcq5aQ4OZXHasOCW43x69pD_T5DaRNCtZ4mnJSEfCC1HfQl1zLMZW4KfG65E90kcNFHiDnk3oqLIATx1IOf4FvWnPI/s4080/20250901_165055.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqM_qB_5MUk1umW7nyA57PBI1DHy5_B_or14xVa7ClQPyH0pErluPO4kfgJIzXLuI0NiZhyphenhyphenflcHiJVg62zoNq-oGlrqTMU5xjIJrcq5aQ4OZXHasOCW43x69pD_T5DaRNCtZ4mnJSEfCC1HfQl1zLMZW4KfG65E90kcNFHiDnk3oqLIATx1IOf4FvWnPI/w300-h400/20250901_165055.jpg" width="300" /></a>\n</div>\n  New ideas are scary, though, and so is making art. Curating it is a lot more\n  comfortable. Perhaps I\'d have a better time organizing what I already have and\n  figuring out some way to present it in public. Not that I have any illusions\n  there\'s a public out there likely to take an interest but I figure it\'s better\n  to offer it than not, even if there are no takers.\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  That\'s a thought that deserves some analysis, isn\'t it? Why does any creative\n  act <i>need </i>to be shared? Surely the act of creation is sufficient in\n  itself. And if an audience <i>is </i>required, <i>I </i>am it. I mean, I\n  really appreciate my own work. In making it public, would I be sharing it in a\n  spirit of benevolence, offering up something I feel is valuable and worthwhile\n  for the pleasure and entertainment of others? Or would I just be looking for\n  validation and applause?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Yeah, I don\'t really care much about all that introspective nonsense. Mostly,\n  I\'d like it on the web because that maximizes its chances of survival over a\n  longer time-frame and I\'m broadly of the opinion that things should persist\n  whenever possible. Besides, someone might get some use or pleasure out of it\n  one day. Also, it\'d be really convenient for me to have it all in one place,\n  even if that was actually several places, as in multiple blogs or websites,\n  with the "<i>one place</i>" in that scenario being the collective wrapper of\n  the internet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As you may have realized by now, those who\'ve stayed with me this far, this\n  isn\'t so much a blog post as a conversation I\'m having with myself as I try to\n  decide what to do next. Coming to the end of the ongoing project I\'ve been\n  engaged with for most of this year has unsettled me a little and this is me,\n  trying to think it through and figure out what comes next.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And do you know what comes next right now? You won\'t guess. I\'ll tell\n  you.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m going to go into the bedroom, open the door to the cupboard where the hot\n  water tank is and rummage through the shelves beneath it, where I keep all the\n  very old clothes I\'m never going to wear again but haven\'t gotten as far as\n  throwing out yet. I\'m hoping that among them I\'ll find a T--shirt I bought in\n  Antequerra about thirty years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That T-shirt, which got too small and old to wear decades ago, has a cartoon\n  on the front of five young women. They aren\'t characters from a comic or a\n  movie or a show. They\'re just five people someone drew and presumably sold to\n  someone else, who turned the image into a piece of clothing that ended up in a\n  shop in a backstreet of a middle-sized town in Andalusia, where I found it and\n  bought it for no reason other than I liked the look of the characters.\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>And then, later, I gave them all names and wrote a story about them. Which is\n  one of the pieces that so far hasn\'t come to light.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I don\'t really think seeing the image again will bring any of the names I gave\n  them back to me. Except I already know what one of them is called because she\n  turns up as a character in that series of vignettes I<i>&nbsp;</i>mentioned.\n</p>\n<p>\n  She\'s called Cat and I\'m hoping if I can find the shirt I\'ll remember which of\n  the five she is. So let me just go see if I can find it...\n</p>\n<p>\n  ... and no, I can\'t. I have, however, discovered the hot water tank is rusting\n  and needs to be replaced immediately, so that was... lucky?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Also, a reminder that there are things more pressing in life than either\n  writing blog posts or worrying about what happened to short stories you wrote\n  half a lifetime ago. And with that I think I\'ll go do something useful for a\n  change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Notes on AI used in this post</span></b></p><p>Just the music, which was created using&nbsp;<i>Suno </i>from a guide vocal uploaded by me. Actually, I whistled the tune. Mostly I sing them but some days my voice just isn\'t willing to co-operate and that apparently was one of those days.&nbsp;</p><p>All the lyrics are mine, adapted from the penultimate paragraph, which reads as follows:</p><p>"<i>Rachel sometimes does fireworks for us, just as it gets dark, and I help with the snow statues. If I feel lonely she\'ll hold me, if I ask. When I\'m tired I go up to my little room and close the door. I think Rachel has a room somewhere, but I\'ve never seen it, Rachel is very real. Perhaps she\'s the real one, not me. Cat and Cathy, I don\'t know where they go. They\'re ghosts.</i>"</p><p>As you can see, I didn\'t change much, just added some emphasis and extra poignancy. I\'ve found the two techniques that work best for turning prose into lyrics are either to add a few rhymes or to use repetition. It\'s amazing how effectively repeated lines and phrases substitute for rhymes.</p><p>I ran lots of variations and fiddled around with them but in the end, the best one was the very first run. It happens that way more often than you\'d think. Suno sometimes seems to get worse the more you ask it to iterate.&nbsp;</p><p>The prompt was</p><p>&nbsp;"<span><i>strings, </i><span><i>cello, </i><span><i>soft, </i><span><i>sweet, </i><span><i>low, </i><span><i>husky female vocals, </i><span><i>Gentle, </i><span><i>soft, </i><span><i>quiet, </i><span><i>restrained, </i><span><i>understated chamber-pop soundscape throughout, </i><span><i>production very crisp and clear, </i><span><i>female vocals low and husky but soft and sweet, </i><span><i>Pitch is generally low, </i><span><i>a somber quality  indie-pop, </i><span><i>dreampop fuzz-pop, </i><span><i>simple subdued drums, </i><span><i>quiet simple bass, </i><span><i>quiet fuzzed guitars, </i><span><i>strings</i><span><span><span>"</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Again, I find repeating things, particularly at the beginning and end of a prompt, helps a lot.

I was up to about a couple of\nhours a day, mostly last thing every night, but now I spend that time on my\nlaptop, burning through Credits on <i>Suno </i>and stitching fragments together\ninto songs in <i>Audacity</i>.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'m still paying several subscriptions to streaming services all the same,\n  though, so I feel obligated to make at least some use of all of them. We did\n  pause&nbsp;<i>Netflix </i>for three months but I re-started it for\n  <i>Wednesday </i>(And happily caught the finale of <i>Upload </i>around the\n  same time.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  While I was looking through the schedules for more to watch, so as to get my\n  money\'s-worth, I noticed the missing seasons of couple of shows I had been\n  following a few months ago had miraculously appeared.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  One of them was <i>Roswell: New Mexico,</i> for which Netflix very annoyingly\n  had held the license to Seasons 1 and 2 in the UK but not Seasons 3 and 4,\n  which&nbsp;were exclusive to <i>Sky </i>over here&nbsp;a the time (If I\n  remember right...). That was great but also too late because, when I finished\n  the first two seasons, I didn\'t want to pay yet another sub so I used a VPN to\n  watch them on Netflix USA.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even more annoying was <i>Young Sheldon</i>, for which Netflix had the rights\n  to stream six out of seven seasons in both the UK and the US but no rights to\n  the final season for either. That was on some US station or service I forget\n  now. All I do remember about it was that I couldn\'t watch it, even with a VPN.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, that agreement, whatever it was, must be over now because Netflix has\n  the full run available to stream. I was finally able to catch up with the\n  show. I\'ll tell you what I thought of it later.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Our other streaming service is <i>Amazon Prime </i>but that one pays for\n  itself in shipping alone, particularly since Mrs. Bhagpuss buys at least one\n  thing on <i>Amazon </i>pretty much every day. What with that and the games and\n  music offers included in the bundle, I feel no urge to watch anything on Prime\n  at all if I don\'t feel like it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The problem there is that I also have <i>Apple+</i> through Prime as an\n  add-on. It was very cheap for three months and I didn\'t really care if I was\n  watching anything on Apple+ or not but now it\'s back up to full price it seems\n  like I should at least watch <i>something</i>. Mrs Bhagpuss doesn\'t currently\n  watch anything on the channel at all so it\'s up to me to pick up the\n  slack.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Luckily, there\'s no shortage of good stuff to choose from. I thought about\n  starting several series about which I\'d heard good things -\n  <i>Severance, Slow Horses, Foundation, The Studio</i> - but in the end I\n  decided on <i>Ted Lasso</i>. Main reason: the episodes were shorter. Secondary\n  reason: I like sitcoms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have now watched all of Young Sheldon Season 7 and Ted Lasso Season 1. The\n  end of one story, the start of another. Here\'s what I thought about them both.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Young Sheldon</i> - Season 7</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was quite dubious about the whole concept of Young Sheldon to begin with.\n  I\'ve never been a huge fan of prequels (Is anyone?) and prequels built around\n  main characters as children can come across as a bit desperate. Added to that,\n  this is just one character from an ensemble show, one that relies almost\n  entirely on the particular skills of the specific actor who played him,\n  <i>and </i>it\'s a character often considered to be difficult and\n  controversial.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The prospects didn\'t look good but contrary to expectations it turned out to\n  be a warm, comfortable, enjoyable watch. A lot less spiky and brittle than the\n  show that spawned it, in fact.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, it also had one other, major problem, something common to all\n  long-running shows that revolve around a young child. Children grow up.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In one respect, that worked in Young Sheldon\'s favor. Old Sheldon, if we can\n  call him that, is a divisive figure in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. A lot of\n  people have some very valid objections to the character in terms of the way it\n  can appear to promote and perpetuate some stereotypically negative views of\n  neuro-diversity. I personally feel the full character arc, taken across the\n  entire run of the show, counters many of those objections, producing a nuanced\n  and distinctly positive image of someone struggling with numerous challenges\n  they find it hard to overcome.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if that\'s true, though, you\'d need to have watched the entire 279\n  episodes to appreciate it. And no-one who thinks Sheldon is an offensive\n  caricature is going to sit through 93 hours of a show that makes their skin\n  crawl just to see if maybe it wasn\'t quite as bad as they thought it was after\n  all. As the saying goes, that\'s an awful lot of Shawshank before you get to\n  the Redemption.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I didn\'t think Young Sheldon had the same level of difficulty. In <i>TBBT</i>,\n  there are five central characters and it\'s not hard to make an argument that\n  all of them are potentially offensive in the way they\'re written and\n  performed. Young Sheldon just has... young Sheldon. And he\'s kinda cute.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All those mannerisms and affectations that seem so mannered and performative\n  in an adult seem a lot softer and more relatable in a child. Kids, after all,\n  <i>do </i>say and do<i>&nbsp;</i>the darnedest things, don\'t they? And it is\n  undeniably satisfying, if you\'ve watched a lot of TBBT, to see many of\n  Sheldon\'s tropes and foibles from that show get their start in some specific\n  event in this one, usually for an understandable and sympathetic reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that is in the show as a whole, though. What about the final\n  season?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, the most striking thing about it is that Sheldon isn\'t actually in it\n  all that much. He\'s in every episode but he\'s rarely the central character and\n  the main story arcs seldom revolve around him. He\'s almost a peripheral\n  character at times, chipping in with a few side-stories or popping up to add\n  some extra perspective to someone else\'s story.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, it\'s about his family, all of whom get some significant character\n  development that changes or enhances what we knew about them. For example...\n</p>\n<p>(This bit might get a bit spoilery from here on down...)</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Meemaw </i>really starts to show her age as she loses her home, her\n  business and her freedom all in quick succession.

Missy and Georgie both seemed to age at a rate that allowed\n  the audience barely to notice it happening but by Season 7,<i>\n    Iain Armitage</i>, playing Sheldon, looked very odd indeed, like a much older child playing a\n  much younger one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The same mannerisms that had made him a cute-if-quirky kid turned him into a\n  slightly disturbing adolescent, never changing his expression, keeping his\n  hands stiffly by his sides and always wearing awkwardly formal clothes. That\n  looks funny in an eight-year old but uncomfortable and unsettling in a\n  teenager. It\'s not surprising they mostly wrote around him towards the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The ensemble cast was uniformly excellent. I liked everyone, which is ideal\n  for a sitcom. I especially enjoyed <i>Annie Potts </i>as Meemaw and her double\n  act with <i>Craig T Nelson</i> as her lover, <i>Dale</i>, was always a joy.\n  The entire cast - and it\'s a big one counting all the regular supporting parts\n  - was on top form throughout and possibly the highest praise I can offer is\n  that, by the end of the final season, I think I liked every one of the\n  characters more than I had at the start.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Actually, the highest praise I can offer is that I\'d happily watch the whole\n  run again. Which I almost certainly will.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Ted Lasso</i> - Season 1&nbsp;</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d heard a little about this show. I\'d heard it was heart-warming, upbeat and\n  positive. I\'d heard it was <i>nice</i>. I also knew it was about a sports\n  coach and, of course, that it was an American sitcom.&nbsp;When I was looking\n  for something to replace Young Sheldon, it seemed like another sweet slice of\n  Americana to send me off to sleep smiling.\n</p>\n<p>Yeah. About that...</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s not "<i>nice</i>", is it?&nbsp; It\'s not all that sweet either. It\'s\n  acerbic and sharp and occasionally even a little bitter. Ted Lasso (The\n  character no the show.) is irony personified.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For one thing, he may be American and a sports coach but he\'s not in America\n  and he\'s not coaching an American sport. Somehow, in all the things I\'d read,\n  I hadn\'t picked up on the "<i>Sit</i>" in the sitcom, which is that he\'s in\n  London, coaching at a Premier League football club.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Or, rather, managing one, which I\'m not sure they ever actually say. Everyone\n  keeps calling him "<i>Coach</i>" but he\'s doing the job we usually call\n  "<i>Manager</i>" over here and he has an actual coach standing next to him,\n  who everyone also calls "<i>Coach</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The show is full of oddnesses like that. I\'d say it does 98% of a great job of\n  being as convincing about life in modern Britain as 98% of British sitcoms can\n  manage but the 2% differences are wholly different in each case.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The writing doesn\'t actually lean that heavily into the\n  one-language-two-cultures comedy you\'d expect. There\'s plenty of that around\n  the margins but it\'s never the point of the show. Ironically, that makes the\n  moments when cultural infelicities do pop up all the more obvious.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  For example, there\'s some considerable business in several episodes about\n  American sport not accepting a tie as a valid result. Which is fine. Except\n  that we don\'t really use the expression "tie" all that much over here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ted <i>always </i>uses the word "<i>tie</i>" in Season 1. Every British or\n  British-localized speaker he uses it to uses it back to him, frequently when\n  no-one here would ever use the word&nbsp;in that way. We\'d almost always say\n  "<i>draw</i>", which is what we call a sports match where the scores end up\n  tied.&nbsp; We use tie as a verb routinely but rarely as a noun.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, just to make it even more confusing, a "<i>tie</i>" as a noun in a\n  sporting comment usually means a fixture or a match. As in "<i>a cup tie</i>".\n  But then, a draw can be a fixture, too, as in "<i>We got Chelsea in the next round - that\'s a tough draw.</i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I can see how it could be confusing but I\'m not even that into sports and it\'s\n  all just second-nature to me because I grew up here. When the word-choices\n  don\'t ring true, it\'s distracting. And clearly I\'m not the only one who\n  noticed because, in the first episode of Season 2, when ties/draws become a\n  big plot point, both words are used and a context for the different usage is\n  established. It\'s just a shame they didn\'t think of that in Season 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of which might seem like nit-picking but it\'s a real nit-picking kind of\n  show. It\'s full of little bits of business about cultural differences and\n  expectations and about how sports teams operate, all of which revolve around\n  nuances of language and fine details of procedure or practice.\n</p>\n<p>I found all that quite engaging. And enlightening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  For example, a while back, <i>Wilhelm </i>posted something on\n  <i>TAGN </i>about bottled water and I left a comment in which I referred to\n  drinking carbonated bottled water, to which Wilhelm pointed out that Americans\n  generally wouldn\'t see much point in drinking fizzy water - they\'d just drink\n  soda if they wanted fizz.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did not know that. Despite having steeped myself in Americana, second-hand,\n  through comics, books, TV, music and movies since I was a child, I had never\n  come across the idea that sparkling water was un-American. And now here it is\n  as a running gag in Ted Lasso, where he keeps being given glasses of water to\n  drink and he takes a huge swig, expecting it to be plain, then spits it all\n  over himself or someone else because it turns out to be sparkling. Who\n  knew?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s plenty like that but the strength of the show isn\'t so much in the\n  jokes as the characters. Or perhaps I should say the caricatures, which is\n  what they seem like, at least in the first few episodes. It takes a good while\n  before the nuances and subtleties begin to reveal themselves or, I ought to\n  say, are revealed by the writers.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And by the end of the season, I still wasn\'t sure just how much depth lay\n  beneath most of the surfaces. The hints at anything more are so brief, so\n  fleeting, it sometimes felt as though I was imagining them. <i>Keeley </i>is a\n  bit older and smarter than she seems, <i>Coach Beard</i> has some quite\n  peculiar-sounding sexual history, <i>Jamie Tartt</i> has an overbearing dad...\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even as I try to tally those glimpses of character, though, I realize how\n  little is really there. Everything is suggestion, misdirection,\n  sleight-of-hand. After ten episodes, how much do we really know about anyone?\n  Not much more than you could write on an index card.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except, maybe, for Ted. <i>He </i>has some depths and they are, largely,\n  hidden. Not from the audience, who get to see him alone in his apartment at\n  night, but from everyone around him.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To everyone else, he\'s relentlessly upbeat but it doesn\'t seem to have gotten\n  him all that far. He coached one successful season of what I think must have\n  been college football and then got head-hunted by a vengeful divorcee in the\n  expectation his skills would not be transferable and he would be a disaster as\n  the "<i>coach</i>" of a top-flight club in the English Premier League, whose\n  prospects she hoped to damage so as to upset her (Unbearable.) ex.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Meanwhile, that very same relentlessly upbeat tendency is revealed as the\n  proximate cause of Ted\'s own impending divorce. He\'s so fucking nice his wife\n  can\'t stand to be around him any more.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Surprised by that swear-word I just threw in,&nbsp;seemingly so unnecessarily?\n  That\'s the show. It does that All. The. Time. It\'s another thing I wasn\'t\n  expecting. When someone tells you a sitcom is really nice and the main\n  character is really nice and "<i>nice</i>" is the word you hear associated\n  with it more than any other, you\'re probably expecting something along the\n  lines of a live-action <i>Wallace and Grommit. </i>Not a&nbsp;swear-fest.\n  Which is what you get.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a really sweary show. Everyone says "<i>fuck</i>" all the time. Except\n  Ted. Who also says it but only when it matters. Unlike&nbsp;over-the-hill\n  superstar <i>Roy Kent</i>, who has a series of running gags revolving around\n  the F-word, which he uses at every opportunity and in front of anyone\n  including, repeatedly and hilariously, his niece and a bunch of her eight-year\n  old pals. The funniest thing about it is his complete unawareness that it\'s\n  not entirely acceptable behavior. He ends up dropping a bunch of F-bombs in\n  his first post-footballing career gig as a TV pundit, which predictably\n  endears him to the audience, if not the presenters. (Although that\'s at the\n  start of Season 2 so I shouldn\'t mention it here...)\n</p>\n<p>\n  I do like me some good, creative swearing, so it\'s a plus point as far as I\'m\n  concerned. And Roy\'s probably my favorite character, unless that\'s Keeley.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a good show, sweary or not. I\'m not quite convinced it\'s a\n  <i>great </i>show, the way it seems to have been pitched in some of the things\n  I\'ve read about it, but it\'s funny and the characters are likeable and it has\n  that hard-to-resist sports narrative running in the background all the time,\n  where even though it\'s all made up, you still want to know whether the team is\n  going to win or not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just let\'s not talk about the actual footballing scenes. Has any show ever got\n  those right? I doubt it. Some of them here have been quite painful to watch,\n  and as I say I\'m not even a sports fan.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I am a sitcom fan, though, and this is a good one. I\'m on Season 2 now and I\n  notice, looking ahead, that the episodes are longer throughout. I\'m guessing\n  that means more plot and deeper characterization rather than more jokes but\n  I\'ll be happy, either way.\n</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKqBRN0umxps8SeA9OiEEcvgVRybKVRUahkxtHEfGt7iHDjMn_3zYVQ6wm3yRe3QDq4eeAowjxS2lIBI13qdE2jSDsaHiQFVFNBckcXV9tfcTZRMELR40ch6dFjmqB1t2CQ9LBlwp6QIUALBhEvQ2fuysMlhQrZg8P6Z7n-SZp6lC7BxAq5GAXEP5Gg_U/s1537/tls11.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="394" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKqBRN0umxps8SeA9OiEEcvgVRybKVRUahkxtHEfGt7iHDjMn_3zYVQ6wm3yRe3QDq4eeAowjxS2lIBI13qdE2jSDsaHiQFVFNBckcXV9tfcTZRMELR40ch6dFjmqB1t2CQ9LBlwp6QIUALBhEvQ2fuysMlhQrZg8P6Z7n-SZp6lC7BxAq5GAXEP5Gg_U/w640-h394/tls11.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />Since I started using AI to make music, earlier in the year, my TV\nviewing, like my gaming, has taken a nose-dive. I was up to about a couple of\nhours a day, mostly last thing every night, but now I spend that time on my\nlaptop, burning through Credits on <i>Suno </i>and stitching fragments together\ninto songs in <i>Audacity</i>.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'m still paying several subscriptions to streaming services all the same,\n  though, so I feel obligated to make at least some use of all of them. We did\n  pause&nbsp;<i>Netflix </i>for three months but I re-started it for\n  <i>Wednesday </i>(And happily caught the finale of <i>Upload </i>around the\n  same time.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  While I was looking through the schedules for more to watch, so as to get my\n  money\'s-worth, I noticed the missing seasons of couple of shows I had been\n  following a few months ago had miraculously appeared.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  One of them was <i>Roswell: New Mexico,</i> for which Netflix very annoyingly\n  had held the license to Seasons 1 and 2 in the UK but not Seasons 3 and 4,\n  which&nbsp;were exclusive to <i>Sky </i>over here&nbsp;a the time (If I\n  remember right...). That was great but also too late because, when I finished\n  the first two seasons, I didn\'t want to pay yet another sub so I used a VPN to\n  watch them on Netflix USA.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even more annoying was <i>Young Sheldon</i>, for which Netflix had the rights\n  to stream six out of seven seasons in both the UK and the US but no rights to\n  the final season for either. That was on some US station or service I forget\n  now. All I do remember about it was that I couldn\'t watch it, even with a VPN.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, that agreement, whatever it was, must be over now because Netflix has\n  the full run available to stream. I was finally able to catch up with the\n  show. I\'ll tell you what I thought of it later.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Our other streaming service is <i>Amazon Prime </i>but that one pays for\n  itself in shipping alone, particularly since Mrs. Bhagpuss buys at least one\n  thing on <i>Amazon </i>pretty much every day. What with that and the games and\n  music offers included in the bundle, I feel no urge to watch anything on Prime\n  at all if I don\'t feel like it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The problem there is that I also have <i>Apple+</i> through Prime as an\n  add-on. It was very cheap for three months and I didn\'t really care if I was\n  watching anything on Apple+ or not but now it\'s back up to full price it seems\n  like I should at least watch <i>something</i>. Mrs Bhagpuss doesn\'t currently\n  watch anything on the channel at all so it\'s up to me to pick up the\n  slack.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Luckily, there\'s no shortage of good stuff to choose from. I thought about\n  starting several series about which I\'d heard good things -\n  <i>Severance, Slow Horses, Foundation, The Studio</i> - but in the end I\n  decided on <i>Ted Lasso</i>. Main reason: the episodes were shorter. Secondary\n  reason: I like sitcoms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have now watched all of Young Sheldon Season 7 and Ted Lasso Season 1. The\n  end of one story, the start of another. Here\'s what I thought about them both.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Young Sheldon</i> - Season 7</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was quite dubious about the whole concept of Young Sheldon to begin with.\n  I\'ve never been a huge fan of prequels (Is anyone?) and prequels built around\n  main characters as children can come across as a bit desperate. Added to that,\n  this is just one character from an ensemble show, one that relies almost\n  entirely on the particular skills of the specific actor who played him,\n  <i>and </i>it\'s a character often considered to be difficult and\n  controversial.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The prospects didn\'t look good but contrary to expectations it turned out to\n  be a warm, comfortable, enjoyable watch. A lot less spiky and brittle than the\n  show that spawned it, in fact.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, it also had one other, major problem, something common to all\n  long-running shows that revolve around a young child. Children grow up.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  In one respect, that worked in Young Sheldon\'s favor. Old Sheldon, if we can\n  call him that, is a divisive figure in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. A lot of\n  people have some very valid objections to the character in terms of the way it\n  can appear to promote and perpetuate some stereotypically negative views of\n  neuro-diversity. I personally feel the full character arc, taken across the\n  entire run of the show, counters many of those objections, producing a nuanced\n  and distinctly positive image of someone struggling with numerous challenges\n  they find it hard to overcome.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if that\'s true, though, you\'d need to have watched the entire 279\n  episodes to appreciate it. And no-one who thinks Sheldon is an offensive\n  caricature is going to sit through 93 hours of a show that makes their skin\n  crawl just to see if maybe it wasn\'t quite as bad as they thought it was after\n  all. As the saying goes, that\'s an awful lot of Shawshank before you get to\n  the Redemption.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I didn\'t think Young Sheldon had the same level of difficulty. In <i>TBBT</i>,\n  there are five central characters and it\'s not hard to make an argument that\n  all of them are potentially offensive in the way they\'re written and\n  performed. Young Sheldon just has... young Sheldon. And he\'s kinda cute.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  All those mannerisms and affectations that seem so mannered and performative\n  in an adult seem a lot softer and more relatable in a child. Kids, after all,\n  <i>do </i>say and do<i>&nbsp;</i>the darnedest things, don\'t they? And it is\n  undeniably satisfying, if you\'ve watched a lot of TBBT, to see many of\n  Sheldon\'s tropes and foibles from that show get their start in some specific\n  event in this one, usually for an understandable and sympathetic reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All of that is in the show as a whole, though. What about the final\n  season?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well, the most striking thing about it is that Sheldon isn\'t actually in it\n  all that much. He\'s in every episode but he\'s rarely the central character and\n  the main story arcs seldom revolve around him. He\'s almost a peripheral\n  character at times, chipping in with a few side-stories or popping up to add\n  some extra perspective to someone else\'s story.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mostly, it\'s about his family, all of whom get some significant character\n  development that changes or enhances what we knew about them. For example...\n</p>\n<p>(This bit might get a bit spoilery from here on down...)</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Meemaw </i>really starts to show her age as she loses her home, her\n  business and her freedom all in quick succession. Her veneer of invincibility\n  begins to peel away and her indomitable spirit wilts a little.\n  <i>Missy </i>shows a good deal of unexpected maturity and character growth as\n  does <i>Georgie</i>, albeit each in very different ways. Sheldon\'s mother\'s\n  religious beliefs start to move her closer to the mania seen in the adult\n  show, while his father... dies.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That was a shock, even though if I\'d been counting the passage of time I\nought to have expected it. It happens right towards the end of the run, just\nwhen everything seems to be going pretty well for him and the family.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was not best pleased when it happened, not only because I liked the\n  character as played by <i>Lance Barber</i> but because I had Young Sheldon\n  firmly in my "<i>Send me off to sleep in a good mood</i>." slot and it seemed\n  like it was going to finish with a couple of episodes where all the cast would\n  be in mourning and filled with grief.

And enlightening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  For example, a while back, <i>Wilhelm </i>posted something on\n  <i>TAGN </i>about bottled water and I left a comment in which I referred to\n  drinking carbonated bottled water, to which Wilhelm pointed out that Americans\n  generally wouldn\'t see much point in drinking fizzy water - they\'d just drink\n  soda if they wanted fizz.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did not know that. Despite having steeped myself in Americana, second-hand,\n  through comics, books, TV, music and movies since I was a child, I had never\n  come across the idea that sparkling water was un-American. And now here it is\n  as a running gag in Ted Lasso, where he keeps being given glasses of water to\n  drink and he takes a huge swig, expecting it to be plain, then spits it all\n  over himself or someone else because it turns out to be sparkling. Who\n  knew?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s plenty like that but the strength of the show isn\'t so much in the\n  jokes as the characters. Or perhaps I should say the caricatures, which is\n  what they seem like, at least in the first few episodes. It takes a good while\n  before the nuances and subtleties begin to reveal themselves or, I ought to\n  say, are revealed by the writers.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And by the end of the season, I still wasn\'t sure just how much depth lay\n  beneath most of the surfaces. The hints at anything more are so brief, so\n  fleeting, it sometimes felt as though I was imagining them. <i>Keeley </i>is a\n  bit older and smarter than she seems, <i>Coach Beard</i> has some quite\n  peculiar-sounding sexual history, <i>Jamie Tartt</i> has an overbearing dad...\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even as I try to tally those glimpses of character, though, I realize how\n  little is really there. Everything is suggestion, misdirection,\n  sleight-of-hand. After ten episodes, how much do we really know about anyone?\n  Not much more than you could write on an index card.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Except, maybe, for Ted. <i>He </i>has some depths and they are, largely,\n  hidden. Not from the audience, who get to see him alone in his apartment at\n  night, but from everyone around him.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To everyone else, he\'s relentlessly upbeat but it doesn\'t seem to have gotten\n  him all that far. He coached one successful season of what I think must have\n  been college football and then got head-hunted by a vengeful divorcee in the\n  expectation his skills would not be transferable and he would be a disaster as\n  the "<i>coach</i>" of a top-flight club in the English Premier League, whose\n  prospects she hoped to damage so as to upset her (Unbearable.) ex.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Meanwhile, that very same relentlessly upbeat tendency is revealed as the\n  proximate cause of Ted\'s own impending divorce. He\'s so fucking nice his wife\n  can\'t stand to be around him any more.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Surprised by that swear-word I just threw in,&nbsp;seemingly so unnecessarily?\n  That\'s the show. It does that All. The. Time. It\'s another thing I wasn\'t\n  expecting. When someone tells you a sitcom is really nice and the main\n  character is really nice and "<i>nice</i>" is the word you hear associated\n  with it more than any other, you\'re probably expecting something along the\n  lines of a live-action <i>Wallace and Grommit. </i>Not a&nbsp;swear-fest.\n  Which is what you get.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a really sweary show. Everyone says "<i>fuck</i>" all the time. Except\n  Ted. Who also says it but only when it matters. Unlike&nbsp;over-the-hill\n  superstar <i>Roy Kent</i>, who has a series of running gags revolving around\n  the F-word, which he uses at every opportunity and in front of anyone\n  including, repeatedly and hilariously, his niece and a bunch of her eight-year\n  old pals. The funniest thing about it is his complete unawareness that it\'s\n  not entirely acceptable behavior. He ends up dropping a bunch of F-bombs in\n  his first post-footballing career gig as a TV pundit, which predictably\n  endears him to the audience, if not the presenters. (Although that\'s at the\n  start of Season 2 so I shouldn\'t mention it here...)\n</p>\n<p>\n  I do like me some good, creative swearing, so it\'s a plus point as far as I\'m\n  concerned. And Roy\'s probably my favorite character, unless that\'s Keeley.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a good show, sweary or not. I\'m not quite convinced it\'s a\n  <i>great </i>show, the way it seems to have been pitched in some of the things\n  I\'ve read about it, but it\'s funny and the characters are likeable and it has\n  that hard-to-resist sports narrative running in the background all the time,\n  where even though it\'s all made up, you still want to know whether the team is\n  going to win or not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just let\'s not talk about the actual footballing scenes. Has any show ever got\n  those right? I doubt it. Some of them here have been quite painful to watch,\n  and as I say I\'m not even a sports fan.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I am a sitcom fan, though, and this is a good one. I\'m on Season 2 now and I\n  notice, looking ahead, that the episodes are longer throughout. I\'m guessing\n  that means more plot and deeper characterization rather than more jokes but\n  I\'ll be happy, either way.\n</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/beginnings-and-endings.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/beginnings-and-endings.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKqBRN0umxps8SeA9OiEEcvgVRybKVRUahkxtHEfGt7iHDjMn_3zYVQ6wm3yRe3QDq4eeAowjxS2lIBI13qdE2jSDsaHiQFVFNBckcXV9tfcTZRMELR40ch6dFjmqB1t2CQ9LBlwp6QIUALBhEvQ2fuysMlhQrZg8P6Z7n-SZp6lC7BxAq5GAXEP5Gg_U/s72-w640-h394-c/tls11.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '4'}

But no-one playing TurtleWoW or THJ pays much attention to that inconvenient detail, for the very understandable reason that they\'ve already written the Live games off as a betrayal of the True Faith and would almost certainly not shed any tears if they disappeared tomorrow.<p></p><p>It leaves Blizzard and Daybreak looking like the worst combination of bullies, killjoys and incompetents as they try to put the very people who are doing what the players want out of business, while refusing to consider doing anything similar themselves, presumably because it would just be too hard for them. I mean, it\'s not like they make games for a living or anything...</p><p>Which leads me directly on to Irony #2, that being said players imagining that, should the teams behind their rogue servers of choice ever build up a sufficient head of steam to challenge the professional game developer elites, they\'d behave any differently. It\'s quite sweet, really.</p><p>There are lots of examples of tiny, dedicated, non-professional teams running retro servers for ancient MMORPGs wholly in the service and with the informed consent of the people who play them. They\'re wonderful. We all applaud their genuinely selfless efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>And note that they\'re hobbyists; developers and players alike.</p><p>They aren\'t running commercial businesses so they don\'t have to make compromises with quality or content to keep their kids in shoes. THJ and TurtleWoW aren\'t quite the same. They most likely are someone\'s livelihood already and if they continue to grow they certainly will be before long.&nbsp;</p><p>They may also be labors of love but so, for the most part, are the original, official games they\'re leeching off. Only, the developers of those games don\'t have the leeway to make noncommercial decisions just to please the players. The more successful their rogue equivalents become, the less leeway they\'ll have, too.</p><p>Which isn\'t to say they won\'t make a better job of balancing the commercial and the aesthetic but they sure as hell won\'t be able to keep all the players happy all the time, any more than any other live MMORPG ever has. And the longer the&nbsp;Classic +&nbsp;style experiments continue, the further they\'ll diverge from the One True Path and the more pissed off the players will get.</p><p>Finally, and most amusingly, there\'s the mortality issue. We\'ve been hearing a lot lately about games dying. Or being killed, rather, because apparently they don\'t just age out and pass away into the Great Gray Nothing all on their own. Someone has to administer the coup de grace.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRVqRQn67P24DU4-LMbcxnQkTSz1mzbAypHubw4G5M2U5H4LOqQO2y8LThHp6zDcxxMQJVBBoEVP7PaqlYDiFgSvhw6XppANSp5yFuIKjdyqFX1RXXGCsT77HQmP5AAFkEAmOSQADnRCSHLyl5nSFRhcqdxB12ute8855-s2jqLF7y62Z4zyeyZ-Ajfz8/s1920/eqgrey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRVqRQn67P24DU4-LMbcxnQkTSz1mzbAypHubw4G5M2U5H4LOqQO2y8LThHp6zDcxxMQJVBBoEVP7PaqlYDiFgSvhw6XppANSp5yFuIKjdyqFX1RXXGCsT77HQmP5AAFkEAmOSQADnRCSHLyl5nSFRhcqdxB12ute8855-s2jqLF7y62Z4zyeyZ-Ajfz8/w640-h342/eqgrey1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>My question is, if someone\'s out there killing them, why don\'t the buggers ever die?&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, they <i>used </i>to, right? Even a hint that an MMORPG I\'d played and enjoyed and felt a connection with might be about to close down for good used to make me come out in a cold sweat. Quite literally in the case of a handful that I <i>really </i>liked.</p><p>Nowadays, about the best I can summon is a shrug. There\'s no emotional impact when I hear a game I used to play is about to sail into the ultimate west because I know that, should I ever get the urge to play it again, I can just hop onto an emulator.</p><p>The whole post-sunset after-life is so much a part of the process now, <i>Massively OP</i> just ran <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/09/23/the-daily-grind-does-your-mmorpg-have-an-emulator-backup-plan-for-when-the-lights-go-out/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a post</span></a> asking readers if the people playing their MMO of choice had a back-up plan in place to spin up an emulator in the event of the real game closing down. It\'s expected now, apparently, and the wise players are far enough ahead of the curve to guarantee there\'s barely a bump as players switch tracks when the official servers power down.</p><p>It seems like the greatest irony of all, the way the one genre that should be the most vulnerable to executive kill orders, due to being both entirely online <i>and </i>running mostly on someone else\'s hardware, ends up being the least likely of all to go dark for more than a blink.&nbsp;</p><p>And it doesn\'t even take a closure for the resurrection to come.</p><p>In the case of the two games mentioned at the top of the post, neither of which has yet given the slightest indication that official service is in imminent danger of being withdrawn, there are dozens of unofficial alternatives available already. EQ even has not one but <i>two</i>&nbsp;authorized, non-commercial third-party alternatives in place! You can go play EverQuest on <i>Project 99</i> or <i>Quarm </i>just as legally as you can play on Daybreak\'s own servers.&nbsp;</p><p>Blizzard haven\'t quite countenanced that yet but they\'ve made it pretty plain they aren\'t interested in closing down every last fan project out there. Just the ones that try to make money.&nbsp;</p><p>I used to like to say that WoW would probably be around longer than I\'d be around to play it. At the time I was thinking of the official version, which seemed likely to last for decades and still does. Eventually, though, Blizzard will shut it down. I won\'t see it happen but you might.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8VTs1PZQ9IFs9FYif0P738ATnaFz7_P95Z_Z5NslVtpKBWLY74J7c8fujAsrrdQpJ1IzZoK9oi9GPlFu3lGZgbHuFNBNaFcTZVP27xejkLFKBtS7a65XV0pZ_VFM_G3sQzuvFqCHFNVDAkXvbxHJx8LSPDK6Zy3Qz08A8Ve4gunmBhKxQS7tmpj7BbLs/s1920/eqwk1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8VTs1PZQ9IFs9FYif0P738ATnaFz7_P95Z_Z5NslVtpKBWLY74J7c8fujAsrrdQpJ1IzZoK9oi9GPlFu3lGZgbHuFNBNaFcTZVP27xejkLFKBtS7a65XV0pZ_VFM_G3sQzuvFqCHFNVDAkXvbxHJx8LSPDK6Zy3Qz08A8Ve4gunmBhKxQS7tmpj7BbLs/w640-h342/eqwk1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The game itself, though, by which I mean some playable version that\'s instantly recognizable as World of Warcraft? That\'s going to be around long after anyone reading this is still here to enjoy it. And so will EverQuest. And many of the others.&nbsp;<p></p><p>There\'ll be no final curtain for any of them, although the day may come when they\'re playing to empty houses. Interest will ebb before opportunity.</p><p>Is that a good thing? I\'m all for historical preservation and personal choice. If people want to play the same game for fifty years, let them. It\'s not without repercussions and consequences, though.</p><p>Daybreak have made the extent to which The Hero\'s Journey\'s success damages their bottom line very plain. Blizzard is going after Turtle WoW for much the same reason, although as part of <i>Microsoft </i>now they have almost infinitely deep pockets, meaning the competition can hardly have the same impact. WoW isn\'t going to close down because TurtleWoW steals a few thousand of its players. EverQuest just might, though, if the shortfall in expected revenue DBG ascribes to THJ\'s success is accurate.</p><p>But even if they both went under, we\'d still be able to play, right? We\'d just roll up new characters on the emulators and start over. So why worry?</p><p>Possibly because all those people playing games that were made twenty or more years ago are sopping up players who could be playing something new, thereby contributing to the much-discussed difficulty every new MMORPG experiences in both attracting and holding an audience.&nbsp;</p><p>And if that\'s happening already, imagine how much stronger the effect might be if those games weren\'t just replicating old experiences but were actively engaged in creating new ones. Every action has consequences, not always intended or foreseen.</p><p>And maybe that\'s the greatest irony of all. If the old games won\'t die, how are new ones going to live?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mostly by not looking or playing anything like the old ones, I\'d imagine...&nbsp;</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss', 'value': '<p><i></i></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHVRssSyW6DIsdoYCYKIVledki5itnsqD3lRJdS6Bg6M1pDmvQcVl23zrxUn0RkIM03g4y9FGdk9Hfbcf_0Egp8rxGh0cySb_fuJO5B4lh9Vh-HDVaJV-h6KZ1BntfXi2vlu9XsARLgX3Pzw644YQ0FdP-PqSS4EbjASNAdgbEVbnCTUsBTx2AEKQSVv0/s1920/eqspires1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHVRssSyW6DIsdoYCYKIVledki5itnsqD3lRJdS6Bg6M1pDmvQcVl23zrxUn0RkIM03g4y9FGdk9Hfbcf_0Egp8rxGh0cySb_fuJO5B4lh9Vh-HDVaJV-h6KZ1BntfXi2vlu9XsARLgX3Pzw644YQ0FdP-PqSS4EbjASNAdgbEVbnCTUsBTx2AEKQSVv0/w640-h342/eqspires1.jpg" width="640" /></a></i></div><i><br />Wilhelm </i>at <i>The Ancient Gaming Noob</i> has <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/28/repercussions-and-tantrums-in-the-eq-emulator-world-around-the-heroes-journey/">a post</a> up about the fallout from <i>Daybreak Games</i>\' ongoing legal battle with whoever it is that operates the for-profit <i>EverQuest </i>rogue server, <i>The Hero\'s Journey</i>.

Unfortunately for them, this eminently reasonable position is currently being undermined by the highly-visible evidence of much smaller, less well-funded teams seemingly doing exactly that.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWXN-h2jYjC9pZgaZqrOveTJSXDVlDK3f_vdUxP6RtbXGzahQFWRQagaV9V2Dq7a8O_T85V-f1ksm-S4PHiO7F9mvgAC3FGbBBQr6O6VWaMVkHsExKxL0LgjTKKAIB5y3pNocs8Xhn3MSWgbacjZfJdqVu3X28yJNk7XZsNKV1am2y8G196mn3qxlEccg/s1280/eqquiil1.bmp" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="512" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWXN-h2jYjC9pZgaZqrOveTJSXDVlDK3f_vdUxP6RtbXGzahQFWRQagaV9V2Dq7a8O_T85V-f1ksm-S4PHiO7F9mvgAC3FGbBBQr6O6VWaMVkHsExKxL0LgjTKKAIB5y3pNocs8Xhn3MSWgbacjZfJdqVu3X28yJNk7XZsNKV1am2y8G196mn3qxlEccg/w640-h512/eqquiil1.bmp" width="640" /></a></div>Only without the encumbrance of an actual, much more popular, live game to run at the same time, of course. But no-one playing TurtleWoW or THJ pays much attention to that inconvenient detail, for the very understandable reason that they\'ve already written the Live games off as a betrayal of the True Faith and would almost certainly not shed any tears if they disappeared tomorrow.<p></p><p>It leaves Blizzard and Daybreak looking like the worst combination of bullies, killjoys and incompetents as they try to put the very people who are doing what the players want out of business, while refusing to consider doing anything similar themselves, presumably because it would just be too hard for them. I mean, it\'s not like they make games for a living or anything...</p><p>Which leads me directly on to Irony #2, that being said players imagining that, should the teams behind their rogue servers of choice ever build up a sufficient head of steam to challenge the professional game developer elites, they\'d behave any differently. It\'s quite sweet, really.</p><p>There are lots of examples of tiny, dedicated, non-professional teams running retro servers for ancient MMORPGs wholly in the service and with the informed consent of the people who play them. They\'re wonderful. We all applaud their genuinely selfless efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>And note that they\'re hobbyists; developers and players alike.</p><p>They aren\'t running commercial businesses so they don\'t have to make compromises with quality or content to keep their kids in shoes. THJ and TurtleWoW aren\'t quite the same. They most likely are someone\'s livelihood already and if they continue to grow they certainly will be before long.&nbsp;</p><p>They may also be labors of love but so, for the most part, are the original, official games they\'re leeching off. Only, the developers of those games don\'t have the leeway to make noncommercial decisions just to please the players. The more successful their rogue equivalents become, the less leeway they\'ll have, too.</p><p>Which isn\'t to say they won\'t make a better job of balancing the commercial and the aesthetic but they sure as hell won\'t be able to keep all the players happy all the time, any more than any other live MMORPG ever has. And the longer the&nbsp;Classic +&nbsp;style experiments continue, the further they\'ll diverge from the One True Path and the more pissed off the players will get.</p><p>Finally, and most amusingly, there\'s the mortality issue. We\'ve been hearing a lot lately about games dying. Or being killed, rather, because apparently they don\'t just age out and pass away into the Great Gray Nothing all on their own. Someone has to administer the coup de grace.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRVqRQn67P24DU4-LMbcxnQkTSz1mzbAypHubw4G5M2U5H4LOqQO2y8LThHp6zDcxxMQJVBBoEVP7PaqlYDiFgSvhw6XppANSp5yFuIKjdyqFX1RXXGCsT77HQmP5AAFkEAmOSQADnRCSHLyl5nSFRhcqdxB12ute8855-s2jqLF7y62Z4zyeyZ-Ajfz8/s1920/eqgrey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRVqRQn67P24DU4-LMbcxnQkTSz1mzbAypHubw4G5M2U5H4LOqQO2y8LThHp6zDcxxMQJVBBoEVP7PaqlYDiFgSvhw6XppANSp5yFuIKjdyqFX1RXXGCsT77HQmP5AAFkEAmOSQADnRCSHLyl5nSFRhcqdxB12ute8855-s2jqLF7y62Z4zyeyZ-Ajfz8/w640-h342/eqgrey1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>My question is, if someone\'s out there killing them, why don\'t the buggers ever die?&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, they <i>used </i>to, right? Even a hint that an MMORPG I\'d played and enjoyed and felt a connection with might be about to close down for good used to make me come out in a cold sweat. Quite literally in the case of a handful that I <i>really </i>liked.</p><p>Nowadays, about the best I can summon is a shrug. There\'s no emotional impact when I hear a game I used to play is about to sail into the ultimate west because I know that, should I ever get the urge to play it again, I can just hop onto an emulator.</p><p>The whole post-sunset after-life is so much a part of the process now, <i>Massively OP</i> just ran <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/09/23/the-daily-grind-does-your-mmorpg-have-an-emulator-backup-plan-for-when-the-lights-go-out/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a post</span></a> asking readers if the people playing their MMO of choice had a back-up plan in place to spin up an emulator in the event of the real game closing down. It\'s expected now, apparently, and the wise players are far enough ahead of the curve to guarantee there\'s barely a bump as players switch tracks when the official servers power down.</p><p>It seems like the greatest irony of all, the way the one genre that should be the most vulnerable to executive kill orders, due to being both entirely online <i>and </i>running mostly on someone else\'s hardware, ends up being the least likely of all to go dark for more than a blink.&nbsp;</p><p>And it doesn\'t even take a closure for the resurrection to come.</p><p>In the case of the two games mentioned at the top of the post, neither of which has yet given the slightest indication that official service is in imminent danger of being withdrawn, there are dozens of unofficial alternatives available already. EQ even has not one but <i>two</i>&nbsp;authorized, non-commercial third-party alternatives in place! You can go play EverQuest on <i>Project 99</i> or <i>Quarm </i>just as legally as you can play on Daybreak\'s own servers.&nbsp;</p><p>Blizzard haven\'t quite countenanced that yet but they\'ve made it pretty plain they aren\'t interested in closing down every last fan project out there. Just the ones that try to make money.&nbsp;</p><p>I used to like to say that WoW would probably be around longer than I\'d be around to play it. At the time I was thinking of the official version, which seemed likely to last for decades and still does. Eventually, though, Blizzard will shut it down. I won\'t see it happen but you might.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8VTs1PZQ9IFs9FYif0P738ATnaFz7_P95Z_Z5NslVtpKBWLY74J7c8fujAsrrdQpJ1IzZoK9oi9GPlFu3lGZgbHuFNBNaFcTZVP27xejkLFKBtS7a65XV0pZ_VFM_G3sQzuvFqCHFNVDAkXvbxHJx8LSPDK6Zy3Qz08A8Ve4gunmBhKxQS7tmpj7BbLs/s1920/eqwk1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="342" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8VTs1PZQ9IFs9FYif0P738ATnaFz7_P95Z_Z5NslVtpKBWLY74J7c8fujAsrrdQpJ1IzZoK9oi9GPlFu3lGZgbHuFNBNaFcTZVP27xejkLFKBtS7a65XV0pZ_VFM_G3sQzuvFqCHFNVDAkXvbxHJx8LSPDK6Zy3Qz08A8Ve4gunmBhKxQS7tmpj7BbLs/w640-h342/eqwk1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The game itself, though, by which I mean some playable version that\'s instantly recognizable as World of Warcraft? That\'s going to be around long after anyone reading this is still here to enjoy it. And so will EverQuest. And many of the others.&nbsp;<p></p><p>There\'ll be no final curtain for any of them, although the day may come when they\'re playing to empty houses. Interest will ebb before opportunity.</p><p>Is that a good thing? I\'m all for historical preservation and personal choice. If people want to play the same game for fifty years, let them. It\'s not without repercussions and consequences, though.</p><p>Daybreak have made the extent to which The Hero\'s Journey\'s success damages their bottom line very plain. Blizzard is going after Turtle WoW for much the same reason, although as part of <i>Microsoft </i>now they have almost infinitely deep pockets, meaning the competition can hardly have the same impact. WoW isn\'t going to close down because TurtleWoW steals a few thousand of its players. EverQuest just might, though, if the shortfall in expected revenue DBG ascribes to THJ\'s success is accurate.</p><p>But even if they both went under, we\'d still be able to play, right? We\'d just roll up new characters on the emulators and start over. So why worry?</p><p>Possibly because all those people playing games that were made twenty or more years ago are sopping up players who could be playing something new, thereby contributing to the much-discussed difficulty every new MMORPG experiences in both attracting and holding an audience.&nbsp;</p><p>And if that\'s happening already, imagine how much stronger the effect might be if those games weren\'t just replicating old experiences but were actively engaged in creating new ones. Every action has consequences, not always intended or foreseen.</p><p>And maybe that\'s the greatest irony of all. If the old games won\'t die, how are new ones going to live?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mostly by not looking or playing anything like the old ones, I\'d imagine...&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/a-free-ride-when-youve-already-paid-or.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/a-free-ride-when-youve-already-paid-or.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHVRssSyW6DIsdoYCYKIVledki5itnsqD3lRJdS6Bg6M1pDmvQcVl23zrxUn0RkIM03g4y9FGdk9Hfbcf_0Egp8rxGh0cySb_fuJO5B4lh9Vh-HDVaJV-h6KZ1BntfXi2vlu9XsARLgX3Pzw644YQ0FdP-PqSS4EbjASNAdgbEVbnCTUsBTx2AEKQSVv0/s72-w640-h342-c/eqspires1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '8'}

Also not remotely accurate. I have a\n  whole slew of things I could write about but none of them is suitable for the\n  hour or two I have available to put something together.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  So I\'m not going to bother. I\'m going to say one thing about a gaming event, get AI to make me a header image, stick a song on the tail-end and call it done.\n  Pathetic, isn\'t it?\n</p>\n<p>Let\'s start with the gaming thing. One of the games I\'m theoretically&nbsp;but not actually still\n  playing is <i>Once Human</i>. I went on and on about\n  how much better it\'d be if they\'d just give us permanent servers where we\n  could settle down like it was a regular MMORPG and then they did and I pretty much never logged in again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I still have <i>OH </i>installed and, I think, updated, so I could go back at\n  any moment. I just need a push. And now I have one. Or I will have, in about a\n  month\'s time.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once Human is hosting\n  <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/09/25/once-human-preps-palworld-collab-launches-new-test-scenario-and-visional-wheel-season/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a collaboration</span></a>\n  with... <i>Palworld</i>. I know! It sounds nuts, doesn\'t it? Until you think\n  about it.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Apart from one looking like it was designed by a sugared-up eight-year old and\n  the other by a teenage techno-goth, the two games are really quite similar.\n  They\'re both open world survival games with a large building component and\n  most importantly they both rely very heavily on capturing creatures and\n  putting them to work.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In Palworld it\'s <i>Pals</i>. In Once Human it\'s <i>Deviants</i>. Pals roam around your\n  home. Deviants roam around your home. Pals come with you and fight stuff.\n  Deviants come with you and fight stuff. Pals let you do things you couldn\'t\n  otherwise do. Deviants...\n</p>\n<p>\n  You get the idea. The mechanics are really very similar indeed and so are the\n  results. Luckily for <i>Starry</i>, the studio behind Once Human, they didn\'t make it so you have you catch Deviants by throwing small spheres at them from a distance. No, you\n<i>  walk </i>up to the Deviant, which is <i>already </i>inside a sphere, and you catch\n  it by holding up your hand, which is <i>entirely </i>different.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not clear on whether the&nbsp; event is a one-way deal, with Pals\n  appearing in Once Human but not the other way around, or whether Deviants will also be popping up in\n  Palworld. Even if it\'s the latter, I doubt very much it would be enough to induce\n  me to go back, even for a visit. Palworld is the open world survival game I\n  liked the least of all the ones I\'ve played, although even then I liked it more\n  than that suggests. It was fun. Just not as much fun as all the others.&nbsp;</p><p></p>\n<p>\n  I also very much doubt a brief return to check out this event will get me to spend much time in Once Human. I seem to be finding it very hard to stick\n  at any games just now. There does seem to be a lot going on in OH,\n  though, what with this, a new scenario and some more Vision Wheel shenanigans, so who\n  knows? With all of that, something might click.\n</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>Another game I\'m eyeing up just now is <i>Erenshor</i>, the solo MMORPG. I\n  played the demo and enjoyed it but I never followed it up. It\'s been in Early Access for a while and\n  there\'s supposed to be a big patch today that changes a whole lot of systems\n  and mechanics so this might be a good time to start.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\nI\'m wondering if I might do better with something like this than with an\nactual MMORPG right now. I\'m assuming Erenshor, unlike an actual MMO, allows you\nto pause or stop at a moment\'s notice, which is one of the main things that puts\nme off playing most of the games I usually enjoy. I\'m wary of starting anything that can\'t be easily interrupted these days.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  What I really should be doing, gaming-wise, is getting back to\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i>, of course. There\'s yet another content drop coming. I could have embedded that video too and the one before but I haven\'t watched either of them for fear of spoilers. I took all that trouble to catch up and the\n  moment I got there, I stopped playing and fell behind again. I should probably\n  prioritize that instead of starting anything new.\n</p>\n<p>That\'s about all I have for today and it\'s more than I thought I had.&nbsp;</p><p>Let\'s finish with a song. Not one of\n  mine. Still pondering how best to present those. Ihave more than a hundred now, which is a problem all of its own.&nbsp;</p><p>How about an old favorite I\'m\n  not sure we\'ve had on the blog before.\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;"><i>Blurry Moon</i> - Charlotte Gainsbourg</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s <i>Charlotte Gainsbourg</i>\'s first new song since 2018, which predates the\n  appearance of regular music features on <i>IF</i>, explaining why she\'s not\n  appeared here before.

Pals let you do things you couldn\'t\n  otherwise do. Deviants...\n</p>\n<p>\n  You get the idea. The mechanics are really very similar indeed and so are the\n  results. Luckily for <i>Starry</i>, the studio behind Once Human, they didn\'t make it so you have you catch Deviants by throwing small spheres at them from a distance. No, you\n<i>  walk </i>up to the Deviant, which is <i>already </i>inside a sphere, and you catch\n  it by holding up your hand, which is <i>entirely </i>different.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not clear on whether the&nbsp; event is a one-way deal, with Pals\n  appearing in Once Human but not the other way around, or whether Deviants will also be popping up in\n  Palworld. Even if it\'s the latter, I doubt very much it would be enough to induce\n  me to go back, even for a visit. Palworld is the open world survival game I\n  liked the least of all the ones I\'ve played, although even then I liked it more\n  than that suggests. It was fun. Just not as much fun as all the others.&nbsp;</p><p></p>\n<p>\n  I also very much doubt a brief return to check out this event will get me to spend much time in Once Human. I seem to be finding it very hard to stick\n  at any games just now. There does seem to be a lot going on in OH,\n  though, what with this, a new scenario and some more Vision Wheel shenanigans, so who\n  knows? With all of that, something might click.\n</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  </div><p></p><p>Another game I\'m eyeing up just now is <i>Erenshor</i>, the solo MMORPG. I\n  played the demo and enjoyed it but I never followed it up. It\'s been in Early Access for a while and\n  there\'s supposed to be a big patch today that changes a whole lot of systems\n  and mechanics so this might be a good time to start.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\nI\'m wondering if I might do better with something like this than with an\nactual MMORPG right now. I\'m assuming Erenshor, unlike an actual MMO, allows you\nto pause or stop at a moment\'s notice, which is one of the main things that puts\nme off playing most of the games I usually enjoy. I\'m wary of starting anything that can\'t be easily interrupted these days.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  What I really should be doing, gaming-wise, is getting back to\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i>, of course. There\'s yet another content drop coming. I could have embedded that video too and the one before but I haven\'t watched either of them for fear of spoilers. I took all that trouble to catch up and the\n  moment I got there, I stopped playing and fell behind again. I should probably\n  prioritize that instead of starting anything new.\n</p>\n<p>That\'s about all I have for today and it\'s more than I thought I had.&nbsp;</p><p>Let\'s finish with a song. Not one of\n  mine. Still pondering how best to present those.

But it is, apparently. Obviously it\'s been edited but as far as I\ncan tell everything you see is gameplay footage.\n<p></p>\n<p>And so is this, which just landed on <i>YouTube</i>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  \n</div>\n<br />That\'s ten minutes of "<i>Official Extended Gameplay</i>" that\nabsolutely looks like a movie. Specifically, the center-piece car chase from a\npretty good movie. A movie I would certainly watch.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  My question isn\'t "<i>Is this game going to be any good?</i>" or "<i>Will it be Pay-to-Win</i>?" or any of those obvious things gamers always ask. It\'s not even "<i>Will it run on my aging PC?</i>", although that\'s a valid concern.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  No, my question is "<i>How the hell is that even possible?</i>" Apart from the\n  oddly stilted walking animations, the video looks like a bunch of clips from a movie.\n  <i>MOP </i>described it as a "<i>sizzle reel</i>" and that\'s really what it\n  is.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  After watching it, I found myself thinking back to something that happened more than thirty years ago, which I\'ve never forgotten. I happened to go into large store in a nearby city and I was walking through\n  the electronics department when I saw, on a large screen (For those days.), a video\n  game playing. It was a castle in a fantasy forest and it looked like just a movie.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never found out what the game was or what it was running on and I can\'t even remember now how I knew it was a game not a film. I\'m pretty\n  sure if I could see it now it would look like something you\'d see in\n  a&nbsp;<i>PS1</i>game. It probably <i>was </i>a PS1 game. It would have been around that time. Whatever it was, it looked like the future. Well, it looked like the past, what with it being a fantasy castle and all, but the past seen through the lens of the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/s1280/anantagirl2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/w640-h448/anantagirl2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Technologically, we are all living in the future now and we take it for granted.\n  Things we pay no attention to or even get anoyed by today would have seemed like literal, actual magic just thirty years ago. If I find it hard to believe something\n  like Ananta can even be real today, imagine how I\'d have felt if I could have watched that trailer\n  in 1995!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Something I hear often these days is that improved graphics can only take the\n  games industry so far and that the limit may already have been reached. And that\'s\n  probably true, as far as it goes. But what\'s hard to believe about this\n  trailer isn\'t so much the visual quality, impressive though it is; it\'s the world-building.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what draws me in to all of these new games, all these new worlds, from\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i> to <i>Neverness To Everness</i> to Ananta: their\n  cinematic, novelistic storytelling. I see clips and I want to know who the\n  characters are, what their lives are like, what they\'re doing. It\'s not new\n  but it <i>seems </i>like it\'s new. It\'s the new future of our long, storytelling past.</p>\n<p>\n  Also, someone\'s bound to be wearing bunny ears in one of these things and that\'s always a\n  bonus. I\'d say you don\'t see <i>that </i>in real life but I saw two people wearing bunny ears in the street only this week...\n</p>\n<p>\n  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>On MMORPGs And Why They\'re Kinda Done</b></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  As big, mass-market affairs, that is. Not as small to medium sized niche services\n  servicing small to medium size niches. They\'re still good there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was\n  <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/#comment-330459"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">something <i>Redbeard </i>said</span></a>\n  in response to <i>Wilhelm</i>\'s post about <i>Ship of Heroes</i> yesterday\n  that started me thinking. For some reason, the conversation took a detour\n  into<i> Guild Wars 2 </i>and how a big part of the revenue system there relies\n  on persuading players to part with cash to remove the inconveniences the devs\n  have added in, seemingly for that exact purpose.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a well-known mechanic in many MMOs. The very unpopular version is to put\n  up obvious pay-walls for in-game services and systems most players believe\n  should be part of the core gameplay. <i>Star Wars: the Old Republic</i> used\n  to be the leader in that awkward field, charging money for everything up to\n  and including enough hot bars to fit your skills.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They toned that down over time and recently they\'ve cut it right back to\n  something closer to what players expected in the first place. It still leaves\n  a whole lot of less controversial money-making opportunities in place, though,\n  one of which is always storage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>GW2 </i>has always had a serious storage problem. The game isn\'t overly\n  generous with inventory space to begin with but it does allow you to expand it\n  in various ways, all of which are technically free. As Redbeard points out,\n  though, its much, much easier to get out your credit card and pay.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never did and that\'s because I played GW2 like an old-school MMORPG. I played for a decade, virtually every day, often for several hours at a time. Just playing normally and not spending any real money, I ended up with a huge amount of\n  inventory space across multiple accounts and characters. On my most-played\n  characters I had all the bag and bank slots you were allowed. I hit the point\n  where even real money wouldn\'t have gotten me any more and I hadn\'t paid a\n  dime.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/s307/gw2leg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="367" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/w640-h367/gw2leg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  It still wasn\'t enough. I made bigger bags and <i>that </i>wasn\'t enough. Nothing was\n<i>  ever </i>enough. GW2 doesn\'t just have a storage problem, it has a loot problem.\n  There\'s far, far, far too much of it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is also the key to <i>not </i>spending any money on storage. You have the\n  choice, as Wilhelm suggests, of just throwing everything away. That\'ll fix it\n  for free and right away. Or you can sell all of the good stuff you find and use the\n  gold to buy Gems, the cash shop currency, then use those Gems to buy more\n  storage space, which is what I did.\n</p>\n<p>\n  People complain all the time about not being able to make enough gold in GW2.\n  I made thousands, easily. I still have most of it because I made far more than I ever needed. I didn\'t make any special effort, either. I had\n  just two tricks for making gold:\n</p>\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\n  <li>\n    <b>Never, ever make any Legendaries. Sell all the mats for them you find to to those who do.</b></li>\n  <li><b>Play every hour god sends</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The first isn\'t a problem. It\'s just sensible. No-one needs Legendary items in\n  GW2. They do nothing for gameplay. They\'re convenience items and cosmetics. Let others waste their time and pay you for the privilege.</p>\n<p>\n  The second is the reason MMORPGs are and always will be a niche interest. They absolutely do not respect your time.&nbsp;</p><p>Redbeard has inventory problems he can only, rationally, solve by paying real\n  money because he doesn\'t play GW2 several hours a day, every day, year in, year out. If he did,\n  the problem would solve itself, at least until there were no more slots left to\n  buy with all that gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All MMORPGs are designed to be played for several hours a day, every day,\n  forever. That\'s the business model. The reason the genre is being lapped\n  by open-world RPGs and survival games is that those offer the same level\n  of intensity and immersion that made MMORPGs successful in the first place but they don\'t go on forever and ever and ever like an\n  eternal treadmill. They don\'t necessarily come with a Game Over title card but they\n  have clear end-points that feel like a satisfying place to stop. And they have clear on-ramps every\n  time they add DLC or major updates, meaning you can dip in and out without worrying about falling far behind.</p>\n<p>\n  Or something. It\'s a theory. I haven\'t really thought it through. Feel free to elaborate and iterate on it.</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">AI Ruins Everything</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s made a lot of people happy, I bet. I don\'t mean that it does. I mean that I said it. Do I mean it, though? Depends what you mean by "<i>AI</i>", doesn\'t it?</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Greg Morris</i>, whose blog I picked up in Blaugust, has\n  <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2025/09/24/i-did-it-myself.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a good take</span></a>\n  on it. He, like me, isn\'t existentially opposed to AI. He sees some merits\n  and uses, as do I. He\'s just not very impressed with what people are doing\n  with it just now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  "<i>Widespread usage of generative products, particularly ChatGPT, by many\n    people I come in contact with is making my life more difficult</i>" he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, mine too. All of ours, I bet.\n</p>\n<p>Like Greg, I am not as sanguine as I could be about my doctor\'s surgery\n  moving to an AI triage system. Neither am I convinced that having AI answer\n  the phone when I call to try and buy something is the best way of\n  handling a commercial transaction. Unlike Greg, I\'m happy to say I don\'t\n  encounter AI in my work although no doubt it\'s only a matter of time, but I\n  have very low confidence in any of the current LLMs being able to send emails\n  that wouldn\'t have gotten me into trouble if I\'d written them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What I do think, perhaps over-optimistically, is that the AIs will either\n  have to get a lot better or most of the companies and services that have\n  adopted them so quickly will have to drop them again pretty quickly too, probably\n  as soon as they notice how much money they\'re losing and how many lawsuits\n  they\'re picking up. Those No Win No Fee lawyers must just <i>love </i>AI.</p>\n<p>\n  This is all LLMs, though. They\'re the bad AIs. Generative AI as a whole may be\n  morally and ethically bad but only some of it is practically bad, too.

AI images of a certain\n  kind stimulate the same level of endorphin production or synaptic snap or whatever it is that\n  makes me look at a line drawing and get a warm, tingly feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Doubly so if\n  it\'s one I\'ve caused to be made myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If I was making my living by drawing pictures, that would piss me off. Or\n  maybe it wouldn\'t. Maybe I\'d just see AI as a new kind of pencil and start drawing with it. At the moment, there\'s resistance to commissioned AI art but will\n  that attitude last? In the end, don\'t people mostly want the right image for\n  the purpose they\'ve commissioned it? Is the provenance of the picture that important? And if your primary (Or ancillary.) motivation is to give work to the artist, does that have anything at all to do with aesthetics?</p>\n<p>\n  To some people, yes, obviously. But to the mass market? I doubt it. And I was\n  never going to commission anyone to draw anything anyway so it\'s a moot point\n  as far as my money is concerned.\n</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>\n  The same applies to generative AI and music, another field where I can claim a\n  longstanding interest.

Most of it is horrible. But I suspect that says more about\n  the musical tastes of the people who are making it than the capacity and\n  potential of the AIs. When people who like the kind of music I like start\n  making music with AI, I\'m pretty sure I\'ll find plenty to enjoy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Always assuming I even know, that is. If people don\'t say they used AI, who\'s going to know?&nbsp;</p><p>There are some free apps around that\n  purport to be able to tell if a song has been made by AI or not. I tried a\n  couple. I\'d give you the links but I forgot to bookmark them.</p>\n<p>\n  One is extremely accurate but that one works by analyzing the frequencies of the\n  sample you submit rather than trying to make any aesthetic judgments. It\'s undeniable that AI has a particular sonic signature you can hear once your ear attunes to it and there\'s a technical accuracy to the timing that human musicians don\'t always\n  achieve. I imagine that could be coded out if the people making AI wanted to\n  hide it.&nbsp;</p><p>That app, unsurprisingly, pegged everything I sent it as having been made by AI. Which it was. I should have dummied it with some human music but I was just dicking around, not running some kind of double-blind experiment.</p>\n<p>\n  The other app, which attempts something more along the lines of a critical analysis, looking at things like the structure and the lyrics as well as the music, was much less certain whether an AI was involved or not. It tended to\n  think most of the songs I was sending it were mostly done by a human.&nbsp;</p><p>And so\n  they were. I wrote all the words. I came up with all the melodies. I gave the\n  AI a guide vocal, which I made sure the AI followed very closely. In my opinion, those songs were indeed made by a human. A human using AI as an instrument.</p>\n<p>I suspect most of the AI music being made doesn\'t have that degree of human input behind it, though. An astonishing amount of AI music is being uploaded to streaming sites every\n  day. Millions of songs. Almost all of them made purely by AI from a short prompt.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see why the platforms might want to filter it\n  out.

She\n    shares the house and garden with a girl in her late teens called Cat, a\n    young woman of indefinable age called Cathy and a woman in her early\n    thirties called Rachel. Phoebe has never left the house and garden. She has\n    no memories of ever being anywhere else. She thinks she had a brother but\n    she doesn\'t really remember him. She reads, plays chess with Cat, and just\n    generally gets through the day. She believes Cat and Cathy are ghosts. She\n    believes she\'s a half-ghost. She believes Rachel is fully real. Cat is\n    friendly and kind to her. Cathy is drifty and vague but unafraid of anything\n    and protective of Phoebe. Rachel is often angry because she wants to leave\n    to get back to her friends, about whom she often talks, but she doesn\'t know\n    how to leave. Rachel, when she\'s in a good mood, creates firework displays\n    and makes snow fall so she and Phoebe can build snow statues of Rachel\'s\n    absent friends. One day, after this has been going on for a long time, two\n    of Rachel\'s friends, Sally and Cado Babe, appear in the garden and soon\n    after they and Rachel are gone. Phoebe is left on her own with Cat and\n    Cathy. She wonders now if she, too, will ever leave. </i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The header image and the second one were both done with Google\'s\n  <i>Imagen 4.0</i> at NightCafe.

A movie I would certainly watch.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  My question isn\'t "<i>Is this game going to be any good?</i>" or "<i>Will it be Pay-to-Win</i>?" or any of those obvious things gamers always ask.

I happened to go into large store in a nearby city and I was walking through\n  the electronics department when I saw, on a large screen (For those days.), a video\n  game playing. It was a castle in a fantasy forest and it looked like just a movie.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never found out what the game was or what it was running on and I can\'t even remember now how I knew it was a game not a film. I\'m pretty\n  sure if I could see it now it would look like something you\'d see in\n  a&nbsp;<i>PS1</i>game. It probably <i>was </i>a PS1 game. It would have been around that time. Whatever it was, it looked like the future. Well, it looked like the past, what with it being a fantasy castle and all, but the past seen through the lens of the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/s1280/anantagirl2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2IaV5jdmvssoI4OByTc8ea42Lj_zd87_PF_tvrUJ_8pm_rPzHWnJF_rqxyvQG8X4HomzwI3AGtjJIMYZ6v49po3ZhsMdeTe_DWh7Ujdox5PzJNYHtmq-GoqxKBEJeLb34gMOHOnUY3EzfcInL8qAqCAL3XR-KBQW61R_HROrsPk5ji2KxBBGnhK6JNoI/w640-h448/anantagirl2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Technologically, we are all living in the future now and we take it for granted.\n  Things we pay no attention to or even get anoyed by today would have seemed like literal, actual magic just thirty years ago. If I find it hard to believe something\n  like Ananta can even be real today, imagine how I\'d have felt if I could have watched that trailer\n  in 1995!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Something I hear often these days is that improved graphics can only take the\n  games industry so far and that the limit may already have been reached.

But what\'s hard to believe about this\n  trailer isn\'t so much the visual quality, impressive though it is; it\'s the world-building.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s what draws me in to all of these new games, all these new worlds, from\n  <i>Wuthering Waves</i> to <i>Neverness To Everness</i> to Ananta: their\n  cinematic, novelistic storytelling. I see clips and I want to know who the\n  characters are, what their lives are like, what they\'re doing. It\'s not new\n  but it <i>seems </i>like it\'s new. It\'s the new future of our long, storytelling past.</p>\n<p>\n  Also, someone\'s bound to be wearing bunny ears in one of these things and that\'s always a\n  bonus.

Not as small to medium sized niche services\n  servicing small to medium size niches. They\'re still good there.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It was\n  <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/#comment-330459"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">something <i>Redbeard </i>said</span></a>\n  in response to <i>Wilhelm</i>\'s post about <i>Ship of Heroes</i> yesterday\n  that started me thinking. For some reason, the conversation took a detour\n  into<i> Guild Wars 2 </i>and how a big part of the revenue system there relies\n  on persuading players to part with cash to remove the inconveniences the devs\n  have added in, seemingly for that exact purpose.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  It\'s a well-known mechanic in many MMOs. The very unpopular version is to put\n  up obvious pay-walls for in-game services and systems most players believe\n  should be part of the core gameplay. <i>Star Wars: the Old Republic</i> used\n  to be the leader in that awkward field, charging money for everything up to\n  and including enough hot bars to fit your skills.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  They toned that down over time and recently they\'ve cut it right back to\n  something closer to what players expected in the first place. It still leaves\n  a whole lot of less controversial money-making opportunities in place, though,\n  one of which is always storage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i>GW2 </i>has always had a serious storage problem. The game isn\'t overly\n  generous with inventory space to begin with but it does allow you to expand it\n  in various ways, all of which are technically free. As Redbeard points out,\n  though, its much, much easier to get out your credit card and pay.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I never did and that\'s because I played GW2 like an old-school MMORPG. I played for a decade, virtually every day, often for several hours at a time. Just playing normally and not spending any real money, I ended up with a huge amount of\n  inventory space across multiple accounts and characters. On my most-played\n  characters I had all the bag and bank slots you were allowed. I hit the point\n  where even real money wouldn\'t have gotten me any more and I hadn\'t paid a\n  dime.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/s307/gw2leg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="367" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEholAg0sQM6N3rfefqhdeqb-dFj-IV2iI06Qjop3-AnHhMWI-EHU9Snz2kew4YSwmUR2W-h-HQlqyLL_PDqiaXDZFdF2O1_vAm8zipjCJWjG36KC382w63Ewcr92rr3PkTcYKeaHe3M8XAhYQnlAVdEsHxYisJPBHlfE1qLyYC3cJY5mPEID0xuiVEIHRE/w640-h367/gw2leg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  It still wasn\'t enough. I made bigger bags and <i>that </i>wasn\'t enough. Nothing was\n<i>  ever </i>enough. GW2 doesn\'t just have a storage problem, it has a loot problem.\n  There\'s far, far, far too much of it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Which is also the key to <i>not </i>spending any money on storage. You have the\n  choice, as Wilhelm suggests, of just throwing everything away. That\'ll fix it\n  for free and right away. Or you can sell all of the good stuff you find and use the\n  gold to buy Gems, the cash shop currency, then use those Gems to buy more\n  storage space, which is what I did.\n</p>\n<p>\n  People complain all the time about not being able to make enough gold in GW2.\n  I made thousands, easily. I still have most of it because I made far more than I ever needed. I didn\'t make any special effort, either. I had\n  just two tricks for making gold:\n</p>\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\n  <li>\n    <b>Never, ever make any Legendaries. Sell all the mats for them you find to to those who do.</b></li>\n  <li><b>Play every hour god sends</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The first isn\'t a problem. It\'s just sensible. No-one needs Legendary items in\n  GW2. They do nothing for gameplay. They\'re convenience items and cosmetics. Let others waste their time and pay you for the privilege.</p>\n<p>\n  The second is the reason MMORPGs are and always will be a niche interest. They absolutely do not respect your time.&nbsp;</p><p>Redbeard has inventory problems he can only, rationally, solve by paying real\n  money because he doesn\'t play GW2 several hours a day, every day, year in, year out. If he did,\n  the problem would solve itself, at least until there were no more slots left to\n  buy with all that gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All MMORPGs are designed to be played for several hours a day, every day,\n  forever. That\'s the business model. The reason the genre is being lapped\n  by open-world RPGs and survival games is that those offer the same level\n  of intensity and immersion that made MMORPGs successful in the first place but they don\'t go on forever and ever and ever like an\n  eternal treadmill. They don\'t necessarily come with a Game Over title card but they\n  have clear end-points that feel like a satisfying place to stop. And they have clear on-ramps every\n  time they add DLC or major updates, meaning you can dip in and out without worrying about falling far behind.</p>\n<p>\n  Or something. It\'s a theory. I haven\'t really thought it through. Feel free to elaborate and iterate on it.</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">AI Ruins Everything</span></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n  That\'s made a lot of people happy, I bet. I don\'t mean that it does. I mean that I said it. Do I mean it, though? Depends what you mean by "<i>AI</i>", doesn\'t it?</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Greg Morris</i>, whose blog I picked up in Blaugust, has\n  <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2025/09/24/i-did-it-myself.html"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">a good take</span></a>\n  on it. He, like me, isn\'t existentially opposed to AI. He sees some merits\n  and uses, as do I. He\'s just not very impressed with what people are doing\n  with it just now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  "<i>Widespread usage of generative products, particularly ChatGPT, by many\n    people I come in contact with is making my life more difficult</i>" he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, mine too. All of ours, I bet.\n</p>\n<p>Like Greg, I am not as sanguine as I could be about my doctor\'s surgery\n  moving to an AI triage system. Neither am I convinced that having AI answer\n  the phone when I call to try and buy something is the best way of\n  handling a commercial transaction. Unlike Greg, I\'m happy to say I don\'t\n  encounter AI in my work although no doubt it\'s only a matter of time, but I\n  have very low confidence in any of the current LLMs being able to send emails\n  that wouldn\'t have gotten me into trouble if I\'d written them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  What I do think, perhaps over-optimistically, is that the AIs will either\n  have to get a lot better or most of the companies and services that have\n  adopted them so quickly will have to drop them again pretty quickly too, probably\n  as soon as they notice how much money they\'re losing and how many lawsuits\n  they\'re picking up. Those No Win No Fee lawyers must just <i>love </i>AI.</p>\n<p>\n  This is all LLMs, though. They\'re the bad AIs. Generative AI as a whole may be\n  morally and ethically bad but only some of it is practically bad, too. The real problem with the rest is that it\'s getting to be too\n  good at what it does.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/s512/wtcf1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqMmAlgUHig0jqqTFeRLYlgjqsNAT_TjMBjo_k_vALdG1cX5q5T4-Lctny3dvOC8c5Mv8tc_Gq3KAtJgcTLW32h5i3kVaMbo6srKbSlzNECCJA__3UWxS3oXHtxAZOA2Fewgo17Yf3ydQwN_jGU2ld3f63tX1FHL9CSvFzeFzIsZbFJtiUc4X7ZpAcOP0/w640-h640/wtcf1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I\'ve been a fan of line art since I was a child. I\'ve spent well over half\n  a century developing a fairly well-trained eye and a reasonably informed,\n  historical understanding of line art and illustration, particularly comics. I\n  have a reliably-formatted emotional and aesthetic reaction to every such image I see that allows me to parse it and contextualize it by way of decades of exposure.</p>\n<p>\n  And I like some of the AI images I\'m seeing these days as well as or better than many, many similar\n  pictures I\'ve seen that were drawn by humans. Humans draw a lot of really bad line art and a lot of them don\'t know how bad it is.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn\'t matter if I know an image is by AI, either. It doesn\'t put me off. The image is the image (cf. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/intentional-fallacy"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Intentional Fallacy,</span></a> as always.) It\'s not\n  like I\'m being tricked into thinking a human did it. AI images of a certain\n  kind stimulate the same level of endorphin production or synaptic snap or whatever it is that\n  makes me look at a line drawing and get a warm, tingly feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Doubly so if\n  it\'s one I\'ve caused to be made myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If I was making my living by drawing pictures, that would piss me off. Or\n  maybe it wouldn\'t. Maybe I\'d just see AI as a new kind of pencil and start drawing with it. At the moment, there\'s resistance to commissioned AI art but will\n  that attitude last? In the end, don\'t people mostly want the right image for\n  the purpose they\'ve commissioned it? Is the provenance of the picture that important? And if your primary (Or ancillary.) motivation is to give work to the artist, does that have anything at all to do with aesthetics?</p>\n<p>\n  To some people, yes, obviously. But to the mass market? I doubt it. And I was\n  never going to commission anyone to draw anything anyway so it\'s a moot point\n  as far as my money is concerned.\n</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>\n  The same applies to generative AI and music, another field where I can claim a\n  longstanding interest. Or at least it applies to music <i>I\'ve</i> made with\n  AI, which I currently prefer to listen to over almost anything else.&nbsp;\n</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/s894/aihg1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="448" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2aRw6PY2tMS2cY75YKeScypmcoWhSBePdfQU3trzzgrQyIKMNs-dpPxD5flAovw2yQsK3bMSg0hzlxdkwCmcOFZDCSu3aEkkG3xH330jvOGXN8dIIbdj7k2TIyAEzsI1JsyTigz91MNRBpag6kFDJH-rsQi6hpsZFo-f9INUXFvp2jsPcynGKImV-nFo/w640-h448/aihg1.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>\n  I have to say that I have yet to hear anything <i>made </i>by anyone else using AI that has\n  the same impact. Most of it is horrible. But I suspect that says more about\n  the musical tastes of the people who are making it than the capacity and\n  potential of the AIs. When people who like the kind of music I like start\n  making music with AI, I\'m pretty sure I\'ll find plenty to enjoy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Always assuming I even know, that is. If people don\'t say they used AI, who\'s going to know?&nbsp;</p><p>There are some free apps around that\n  purport to be able to tell if a song has been made by AI or not. I tried a\n  couple. I\'d give you the links but I forgot to bookmark them.</p>\n<p>\n  One is extremely accurate but that one works by analyzing the frequencies of the\n  sample you submit rather than trying to make any aesthetic judgments. It\'s undeniable that AI has a particular sonic signature you can hear once your ear attunes to it and there\'s a technical accuracy to the timing that human musicians don\'t always\n  achieve. I imagine that could be coded out if the people making AI wanted to\n  hide it.&nbsp;</p><p>That app, unsurprisingly, pegged everything I sent it as having been made by AI. Which it was. I should have dummied it with some human music but I was just dicking around, not running some kind of double-blind experiment.</p>\n<p>\n  The other app, which attempts something more along the lines of a critical analysis, looking at things like the structure and the lyrics as well as the music, was much less certain whether an AI was involved or not. It tended to\n  think most of the songs I was sending it were mostly done by a human.&nbsp;</p><p>And so\n  they were. I wrote all the words. I came up with all the melodies. I gave the\n  AI a guide vocal, which I made sure the AI followed very closely. In my opinion, those songs were indeed made by a human. A human using AI as an instrument.</p>\n<p>I suspect most of the AI music being made doesn\'t have that degree of human input behind it, though. An astonishing amount of AI music is being uploaded to streaming sites every\n  day. Millions of songs. Almost all of them made purely by AI from a short prompt.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see why the platforms might want to filter it\n  out. Except, if their customers are happily listening to it, why would they\n  bother?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Bad pushes out good is the old saw. But what if the bad gets good and the good\n  isn\'t as good as all that?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">If We\'re All Sitting Comfortably...&nbsp;</span></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgogKlcaPXPAqMT0i2JGUP1AASH0N53klNO2vBjiarVyd_k5Tr2euZ-HMPifU0RQ8z4E0XjhgDEKpA4auyEKffhpJ_Wktf9PlFzHNfXij_15r3CgN9viofVvjpexfcdPsVadvizaEWZOU8EcboNz4vVqVZuFez5NzZKevtaHeEWh6stxo4LC3Zvgxn9c8o/s650/twge1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgogKlcaPXPAqMT0i2JGUP1AASH0N53klNO2vBjiarVyd_k5Tr2euZ-HMPifU0RQ8z4E0XjhgDEKpA4auyEKffhpJ_Wktf9PlFzHNfXij_15r3CgN9viofVvjpexfcdPsVadvizaEWZOU8EcboNz4vVqVZuFez5NzZKevtaHeEWh6stxo4LC3Zvgxn9c8o/w348-h400/twge1.png" width="348" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  <i>Gemini </i>has a new trick.

The full prompt for the whole thing was an\n  ad hoc precis of a whole series of fictional pieces I published in an APA back\n  in the 90s. At some point I will be posting the originals, complete with the\n  infinitely superior full text and collaged illustrations, so if you have any\n  interest, you might want to wait for that:\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;"<i>Please make me a picture book for adults about a girl called Phoebe, aged\n    about 12 or 13, who lives in a rambling old house with a walled garden. She\n    shares the house and garden with a girl in her late teens called Cat, a\n    young woman of indefinable age called Cathy and a woman in her early\n    thirties called Rachel. Phoebe has never left the house and garden. She has\n    no memories of ever being anywhere else. She thinks she had a brother but\n    she doesn\'t really remember him. She reads, plays chess with Cat, and just\n    generally gets through the day. She believes Cat and Cathy are ghosts. She\n    believes she\'s a half-ghost. She believes Rachel is fully real. Cat is\n    friendly and kind to her. Cathy is drifty and vague but unafraid of anything\n    and protective of Phoebe. Rachel is often angry because she wants to leave\n    to get back to her friends, about whom she often talks, but she doesn\'t know\n    how to leave. Rachel, when she\'s in a good mood, creates firework displays\n    and makes snow fall so she and Phoebe can build snow statues of Rachel\'s\n    absent friends. One day, after this has been going on for a long time, two\n    of Rachel\'s friends, Sally and Cado Babe, appear in the garden and soon\n    after they and Rachel are gone. Phoebe is left on her own with Cat and\n    Cathy. She wonders now if she, too, will ever leave. </i>"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The header image and the second one were both done with Google\'s\n  <i>Imagen 4.0</i> at NightCafe. For some reason, instead of taking a couple of\n  screenshots from the Ananta videos, I thought it would be amusing to have an\n  AI make them instead. The prompt for the top image was "<i>An anime girl dressed in blue with bunny ears riding in an electric blue\n    sports car along a freeway between the towering skyscrapers of a near-future\n    city. Bright sunshine, blue sky.

People\ntake time off work or call in sick just to be part of that launch-day crowd.\nNo-one wants to miss out on an event that might be something people talk\nabout for years.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, there are risks. The servers often buckle under the load. Even when\n  the devs have been diligent with stress testing and allowances have been made\n  for the crush, they always somehow seem to underestimate the demand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if the servers stay up, there are bound to be queues. We\'ve all seen the\n  screenshots - #6,427 in line: estimated waiting time two hours and\n  counting.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  If only there was a way to ensure anyone who wanted to play could get into the\n  game quickly and easily, without having to go through all those hassles...\n</p>\n<p>Guess what? There is! Here\'s how you do it...</p>\n<p>\n  Charge $60 for the (Non-existent.) box <i>and </i>demand&nbsp;fifteen dollars\n  a month to keep on playing after the first thirty days! That ought to do it!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ah, but is it enough? If your game is <i>really </i>good and has fantastic\n  word of mouth and the streamers are all plugging it like crazy and you\'ve\n  picked out a spot in the market where there\'s no direct competition, maybe\n  you\'ll still find yourself overwhelmed by hordes of frantic players throwing\n  money at you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, just to be safe, why not go head-to-head with the free-to-play game that\n  inspired the one you just spent years on? And why not make sure your\n  AAA-priced version of that familiar title looks like "<i>a relic of a bygone era</i>", specifically "<i>the early 00\'s</i>". Make sure it\'s "<i>worse than games released 2 decades ago</i>" and be sure it plays&nbsp;"<i>like a student project or an alpha build with a bunch of placeholders for\n    real icons, graphics, sound effects, systems, and so on</i>".&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not my words, just a few choice quotes from the <i>Steam </i>reviews, where\n  <i>Ship of Heroes</i> (Aww - you guessed...) is currently enjoying a rating of\n  <i>Mostly Negative </i>from forty-eight reviews.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And since everyone really <i>loves </i>AI these days, especially gamers, why\n  not use it instead of actual actors for your NPC voice acting? That last\n  allegation appears to have been disputed by the developers but the general\n  impression is that the voice acting is "<i>awful</i>" no matter whether humans\n  or machines are doing it, so it probably doesn\'t matter much either way.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that in place (And a lot more besides.) it\'s safe to assume your\n  players won\'t run into any of those all-too-familiar launch day issues. Your\n  servers will almost certainly be able to withstand the strain of the teens of\n  people willing to stump up the cost of<i> Baldurs Gate 3 </i>for a chance to\n  play "<i>a buggy mess</i>" for a month before having to get their credit cards\n  out once more for the right to carry on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If nothing else, you\'ll certainly be able to claim you had no queues at launch\n  and everyone was able to log straight in.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/s600/soh4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/w640-h360/soh4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was going to post something more high-minded about all this but\n  <i>Wilhelm </i>got there before me so I took the low road. For a less snarky\n  take on the situation I refer you to\n  <i><a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">TAGN</span></a></i>. I do have a few semi-serious observations of my own to make, though.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1890100/Ship_of_Heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Ship of Heroes</span></a>\n  launched yesterday to a largely disinterested gaming public, most of whom had\n  probably only heard of the game at all thanks to the recent flurry of\n  (Negative.) press interest generated by open disbelief at the price point. If\n  the plan was to raise the game\'s profile then I suppose they achieved it but I\n  suspect they may be learning there is such a thing as bad publicity after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game is available through Steam and only through Steam, so for once we\n  have an MMORPG whose exact population is relatively easy to ascertain.\n  <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1890100/charts/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The numbers are in</span></a>\n  and they are not pretty.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;The "<i>All Time</i>" (By which we mean two days.) peak stands at a tidy\n  100. As I type this, there are sixteen players online.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just for contrast,<i> Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen</i>, which entered Early\n  Access on Steam last December at a box price of $39.99, has an all-time\n  peak of just under 7,000 players with five hundred people playing right now.\n  That sounds like it might be a viable business model. This does not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Then again, who am I to say? I played both games, very briefly, in open\n  testing and decided not to pay much more attention to either of them. I might\n  have been the target market once but that seems a very long time ago now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It would also be ridiculous of me to pretend to be surprised by how the Ship\n  of Heroes launch is going. Apart from that irritating clique that seems to\n  think everything is de facto better the more pointlessly exclusive you make\n  it, there has been universal incomprehension at the business model\n  <i>Heroic Games </i>has chosen. No-one expected it to pay off and it has\n  exceeded even those expectations. Or fallen below them.

People\ntake time off work or call in sick just to be part of that launch-day crowd.\nNo-one wants to miss out on an event that might be something people talk\nabout for years.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Of course, there are risks. The servers often buckle under the load. Even when\n  the devs have been diligent with stress testing and allowances have been made\n  for the crush, they always somehow seem to underestimate the demand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even if the servers stay up, there are bound to be queues. We\'ve all seen the\n  screenshots - #6,427 in line: estimated waiting time two hours and\n  counting.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  If only there was a way to ensure anyone who wanted to play could get into the\n  game quickly and easily, without having to go through all those hassles...\n</p>\n<p>Guess what? There is! Here\'s how you do it...</p>\n<p>\n  Charge $60 for the (Non-existent.) box <i>and </i>demand&nbsp;fifteen dollars\n  a month to keep on playing after the first thirty days! That ought to do it!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ah, but is it enough? If your game is <i>really </i>good and has fantastic\n  word of mouth and the streamers are all plugging it like crazy and you\'ve\n  picked out a spot in the market where there\'s no direct competition, maybe\n  you\'ll still find yourself overwhelmed by hordes of frantic players throwing\n  money at you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  So, just to be safe, why not go head-to-head with the free-to-play game that\n  inspired the one you just spent years on? And why not make sure your\n  AAA-priced version of that familiar title looks like "<i>a relic of a bygone era</i>", specifically "<i>the early 00\'s</i>". Make sure it\'s "<i>worse than games released 2 decades ago</i>" and be sure it plays&nbsp;"<i>like a student project or an alpha build with a bunch of placeholders for\n    real icons, graphics, sound effects, systems, and so on</i>".&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not my words, just a few choice quotes from the <i>Steam </i>reviews, where\n  <i>Ship of Heroes</i> (Aww - you guessed...) is currently enjoying a rating of\n  <i>Mostly Negative </i>from forty-eight reviews.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  And since everyone really <i>loves </i>AI these days, especially gamers, why\n  not use it instead of actual actors for your NPC voice acting? That last\n  allegation appears to have been disputed by the developers but the general\n  impression is that the voice acting is "<i>awful</i>" no matter whether humans\n  or machines are doing it, so it probably doesn\'t matter much either way.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that in place (And a lot more besides.) it\'s safe to assume your\n  players won\'t run into any of those all-too-familiar launch day issues. Your\n  servers will almost certainly be able to withstand the strain of the teens of\n  people willing to stump up the cost of<i> Baldurs Gate 3 </i>for a chance to\n  play "<i>a buggy mess</i>" for a month before having to get their credit cards\n  out once more for the right to carry on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If nothing else, you\'ll certainly be able to claim you had no queues at launch\n  and everyone was able to log straight in.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/s600/soh4.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8Gq9xJsVSxUqW6uBLAgoLg-P6vGzR93x18uaNnbXuqFUhDA6ndb_j63EI415BL2wdQsa7HkYZy4M2tO3EX-iExynjfG8c2PkQ3o_mdCxBKLfkH8FNR3ZJfb_1fxPxEQyU2zJYFUy2CjZ7W9FiEwR2IYcK2-rYTgtIPYgw1FFMlmWS3nl6_W4IkDI9b_w/w640-h360/soh4.png" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I was going to post something more high-minded about all this but\n  <i>Wilhelm </i>got there before me so I took the low road. For a less snarky\n  take on the situation I refer you to\n  <i><a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/what-of-this-ship-of-heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">TAGN</span></a></i>. I do have a few semi-serious observations of my own to make, though.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1890100/Ship_of_Heroes/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">Ship of Heroes</span></a>\n  launched yesterday to a largely disinterested gaming public, most of whom had\n  probably only heard of the game at all thanks to the recent flurry of\n  (Negative.) press interest generated by open disbelief at the price point. If\n  the plan was to raise the game\'s profile then I suppose they achieved it but I\n  suspect they may be learning there is such a thing as bad publicity after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The game is available through Steam and only through Steam, so for once we\n  have an MMORPG whose exact population is relatively easy to ascertain.\n  <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1890100/charts/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">The numbers are in</span></a>\n  and they are not pretty.\n</p>\n<p>\n  &nbsp;The "<i>All Time</i>" (By which we mean two days.) peak stands at a tidy\n  100. As I type this, there are sixteen players online.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just for contrast,<i> Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen</i>, which entered Early\n  Access on Steam last December at a box price of $39.99, has an all-time\n  peak of just under 7,000 players with five hundred people playing right now.\n  That sounds like it might be a viable business model. This does not.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Then again, who am I to say? I played both games, very briefly, in open\n  testing and decided not to pay much more attention to either of them. I might\n  have been the target market once but that seems a very long time ago now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It would also be ridiculous of me to pretend to be surprised by how the Ship\n  of Heroes launch is going. Apart from that irritating clique that seems to\n  think everything is de facto better the more pointlessly exclusive you make\n  it, there has been universal incomprehension at the business model\n  <i>Heroic Games </i>has chosen. No-one expected it to pay off and it has\n  exceeded even those expectations. Or fallen below them. However that goes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'m not even really surprised to hear the game is janky, buggy and crashes a\n  lot, as many reviews on Steam complain.

A hundred and fifty hours\' worth, in fact. That means I must have played Lyrielle for longer than nearly every game on my <i>Steam </i>account - and I still can\'t tell you a damn thing about her!</p><p>I can\'t even remember why she\'s called Lyrielle. Most of my characters are named for some other character in some book I read and this certainly sounds like one of those names but it\'s not ringing any bells at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With <i>Woolhat</i>, on the other hand, I know exactly where the name comes from. He\'s an Iksar Monk and he used to be called <i>Nesmith</i>. Then there was some server merge or other and he ended up with an X on the end of his name so I renamed him Woolhat.&nbsp;</p><p>I imagine most people reading this (People read this stuff?!) don\'t need any further explanation but for the few that may, <i>Mike Nesmith</i> was one of<i> the Monkees</i> and I thought it was clever to name a Monk after a Monkee. I bet no-one else ever thought of that! And his nickname in the TV show was Woolhat. Because he always wore a wool hat. So the renaming was even cleverer!&nbsp;</p><p>(The Monkees were a pop group. They had a TV show in the sixties. Ask your grandparents.)</p><p>Nesmith/Woolhat did get played a little but for the longest time his main function has been as one of my Bazaar traders and bankers. He holds and sells a lot of stuff for other characters. These days, hold it is all he does because I haven\'t set him to trade for years. But he\'s happy enough.</p><p><i>Gladwaller</i>, it will surprise no-one to know, has been boosted. I didn\'t level him to 85. He was played, though, for a while, before that happened. He\'s a Gnome Enchanter and I made him when I fancied playing the class and didn\'t have one to hand. I messed around with him for a bit and got him into the teens or twenties then dropped him, I think because we moved servers.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no clue why I boosted him years later. The idea of jumping in at Level 85 and trying to play an Enchanter, either solo or in a group, is just fatuous. Maybe I wanted a buff-bot. I\'m pretty sure he\'s never left <i>Plane of Knowledge </i>since he drank the potion.</p><p>His name would appear to be <a href="https://salinger.org/characters/gladwaller/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">taken </span></a>from <i>J.D. Salinger</i>, which would make him my most literary of steals. As a massive Salinger fan, I may well have chosen it deliberately because of that, although I don\'t recall doing it. More likely I just had the name in mind from reading some Salinger around the same time.</p><p><i>Cofferstone</i>\'s name probably comes from <i>Frances Hardinge</i>\'s&nbsp; <i>Fly By Night</i> or<i> Twilight Robbery</i>, two excellent novels from which I\'ve borrowed several names for characters in various games. If he seems to have a lot of played hours for a Level 2, that\'s because he\'s my other Bazaar trader. I have one on each of the two accounts I (used to) play regularly. Cofferstone got a lot of use when I was leveling <i>Magmia</i> by doing Overseer missions every day. You can make very good money like that. And I did, for a few months, until all the swapping between accounts to hand the stuff across got on my nerves.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/s1456/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="314" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/w640-h314/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" width="640" /></a></div>And finally we come to <i>Telza</i>, about whom there really is nothing to say. Another boosted character, this time a Shaman. I have never played a Shaman beyond the teens so, like Gladwaller, the idea of starting at 85 is fanciful. Then again, I <i>have </i>played a Beastlord, all the way to 84, and the skill sets are extremely similar, so maybe it\'s not such a crazy idea after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p><p>Still never did it, though. Again, Telza has almost certainly never left <i>PoK</i>.&nbsp; She\'s named for <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telzey_Amberdon">Telzey Amberdon</a></i></span>, lead character in a series of novels by <i>James H. Schmitz</i>, all of which I have now read, although I\'m not sure I had back in 2017, when I created her.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first of the series, which I read in the 1970s, Telzey has an intelligent great cat as a companion, and I\'m fairly sure my original plan was to use one of the free boosts to make a Beastlord, for whom the reference would have been highly appropriate. When the time came, though, I decided against it on the grounds that I already had a perfectly good Beastlord and I went for a Shaman instead, which is a less-good fit for the name.&nbsp;</p><p>And then I never played her and made another Beastlord later and boosted her instead. So much for planning. Should have saved the name.</p><p>As that last sentence suggests, I didn\'t stop making characters after these twenty-five. I did slow down a lot but there are maybe half a dozen more out there, including a few I\'ve actually played, like <i>Shadbaggle </i>(Yet another boosted Necro.), <i>Clatterhorse </i>(Who had a run on one of the TLE servers for a while.), <i>Taffetty </i>and <i>Corella</i>. All of whom I remember more clearly than poor old Lyrielle the Forgotten Druid.</p><p>Will I ever make another? I wouldn\'t bet against it. Every time I write one of these posts I start to feel the old itch.</p><p>For now, though, that\'s it, I think. No more characters to write about. Anniversary celebration complete.</p><p>I do have another idea for a series of ad hoc posts, where I wax nostalgic about the days when I actually played games instead of just wrote about them. Something about&nbsp;<i>EverQuest II</i>, this time.

He\'s a Gnome Enchanter and I made him when I fancied playing the class and didn\'t have one to hand. I messed around with him for a bit and got him into the teens or twenties then dropped him, I think because we moved servers.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no clue why I boosted him years later. The idea of jumping in at Level 85 and trying to play an Enchanter, either solo or in a group, is just fatuous. Maybe I wanted a buff-bot. I\'m pretty sure he\'s never left <i>Plane of Knowledge </i>since he drank the potion.</p><p>His name would appear to be <a href="https://salinger.org/characters/gladwaller/"><span style="color: #ff00fe;">taken </span></a>from <i>J.D. Salinger</i>, which would make him my most literary of steals. As a massive Salinger fan, I may well have chosen it deliberately because of that, although I don\'t recall doing it. More likely I just had the name in mind from reading some Salinger around the same time.</p><p><i>Cofferstone</i>\'s name probably comes from <i>Frances Hardinge</i>\'s&nbsp; <i>Fly By Night</i> or<i> Twilight Robbery</i>, two excellent novels from which I\'ve borrowed several names for characters in various games. If he seems to have a lot of played hours for a Level 2, that\'s because he\'s my other Bazaar trader. I have one on each of the two accounts I (used to) play regularly. Cofferstone got a lot of use when I was leveling <i>Magmia</i> by doing Overseer missions every day. You can make very good money like that. And I did, for a few months, until all the swapping between accounts to hand the stuff across got on my nerves.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/s1456/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="314" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoeVO5wuVPOCBC8Ks-GiX_TkZAme0HrQMrA1FiJv2OweTbsyuJ-0Ev3QxjTa2dBtTXpTbNFcZsK11Nx4uh_iB56S_pPM_scf-yq-wRpBK0wWtfq1nWPl4FQdxeEDtLkm5rds56HzK-7aF5UbiGdYpOsFX1iEH050iM8GVjOEmK3H9wDbmF4VHT_NcJHk8/w640-h314/eqnickolaiovitch1.png" width="640" /></a></div>And finally we come to <i>Telza</i>, about whom there really is nothing to say. Another boosted character, this time a Shaman. I have never played a Shaman beyond the teens so, like Gladwaller, the idea of starting at 85 is fanciful. Then again, I <i>have </i>played a Beastlord, all the way to 84, and the skill sets are extremely similar, so maybe it\'s not such a crazy idea after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p><p>Still never did it, though. Again, Telza has almost certainly never left <i>PoK</i>.&nbsp; She\'s named for <span style="color: #ff00fe;"><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telzey_Amberdon">Telzey Amberdon</a></i></span>, lead character in a series of novels by <i>James H. Schmitz</i>, all of which I have now read, although I\'m not sure I had back in 2017, when I created her.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first of the series, which I read in the 1970s, Telzey has an intelligent great cat as a companion, and I\'m fairly sure my original plan was to use one of the free boosts to make a Beastlord, for whom the reference would have been highly appropriate. When the time came, though, I decided against it on the grounds that I already had a perfectly good Beastlord and I went for a Shaman instead, which is a less-good fit for the name.&nbsp;</p><p>And then I never played her and made another Beastlord later and boosted her instead. So much for planning. Should have saved the name.</p><p>As that last sentence suggests, I didn\'t stop making characters after these twenty-five. I did slow down a lot but there are maybe half a dozen more out there, including a few I\'ve actually played, like <i>Shadbaggle </i>(Yet another boosted Necro.), <i>Clatterhorse </i>(Who had a run on one of the TLE servers for a while.), <i>Taffetty </i>and <i>Corella</i>. All of whom I remember more clearly than poor old Lyrielle the Forgotten Druid.</p><p>Will I ever make another? I wouldn\'t bet against it. Every time I write one of these posts I start to feel the old itch.</p><p>For now, though, that\'s it, I think. No more characters to write about. Anniversary celebration complete.</p><p>I do have another idea for a series of ad hoc posts, where I wax nostalgic about the days when I actually played games instead of just wrote about them. Something about&nbsp;<i>EverQuest II</i>, this time. We\'ll see how that goes...&nbsp;</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-final-five-er-wait-no-theres-six-of.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-final-five-er-wait-no-theres-six-of.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgSPBaiieqkptSPn9wKzYZffSJben34fsF-PTuBeJ_WqdsoVpvIMok1bjVGtxoHf-9y6Q4IoQsd0MxhoatZiE5G8I5gFgY7kyFiFhl7zLHAlVZ4Vg5zx3vKJAgsPlosXuXju66kmyXzvbCVsa3n4RupWhXynwVogQNPlslpY_jM2nqISdNaUHM2dIHDzw/s72-w622-h640-c/eqfinalsix1.png', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '6'}

The event, which used to be known as\n  <i>Days of Summer</i>, when it started a litle earlier in the year, is a\n  series of weekly quests in <i>EverQuest II</i> that, at least on the face of\n  it, offers a huge boost in power for casual players at the cost of very little\n  effort indeed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At least, that\'s how it appears until you take a closer look at the way it\n  works. I had the opportunity to do just that yesterday, when I went to pick up\n  the first of this year\'s quests and found I hadn\'t finished last year\'s yet.\n  Or started them, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Technically, I <i>had </i>started the 2024 set of nine quests, but only in\n  that I\'d visited <i>Bao Bao</i>, the current Panda-in-Residence, and taken the\n  first one. It was in my Journal but I hadn\'t actually done anything about it\n  in twelve months. Bao Bao was not interested in giving me this year\'s quests\n  until I finished the job I was already on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I had thought you could skip the ones you hadn\'t done. You\'d probably want to\n  if you were a new or returning player because the event has been running since\n  2017, meaning there are now seventy-two quests in the full sequence, not\n  counting the new ones this year. There are a lot of rewards from previous\n  years that still have some currency, not least the huge number of house items,\n  but the main thrust of the event has always been to gear up and who wants a\n  load of outdated armor with inferior stats?\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/The_%22Travels%22_of_Yun_Zi_Timeline">The wiki</a>\n  is somewhat confusing on whether you can skip the years you don\'t want to do:\n  "<i>Each of the quests must be completed in the order they were released,\n    starting with the quests from 2017. You cannot skip ahead to later points in\n    the quest series. </i><b><i>*2023 can be completed without previous progress in this questline.</i>"</b>&nbsp;(Emphasis theirs.) Why 2023 is different from the rest I couldn\'t tell\n  you but it doesn\'t seem to have been the start of a new, more relaxed ruleset\n  because this year\'s starter quest looked to be firmly gated behind completion\n  of last year\'s.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/s1916/eq2lfey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/w640-h302/eq2lfey1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I imagine the reason I thought you could skip was because in 2023 you really\n  could. Maybe I did. I haven\'t checked. I vaguely remember deciding last year\n  that, since I wasn\'t going to use any of the gear, I wouldn\'t bother doing the\n  quests. Or maybe that\'s post hoc rationalization. It\'s entirely possible I\n  just forgot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There were nine quests in the 2024 set. There are nine every year. It takes us\n  through the autumn to the arrival of the annual expansion, one quest dropping\n  every week after the regular update, usually, on a Tuesday. It\'s a pleasant\n  weekly ritual to get the new one, fly around for a few minutes ticking the\n  necessary boxes, then come back to see what new stuff you can grab off the\n  store-panda.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you let yourself fall behind, however, it all feels a bit less amusing.\n  Last night and this morning I did all nine quests. I did it the fastest way\n  possible, using my All Access Membership for instant travel to and from the\n  various zones, moving between the various locations within those zones on my\n  very fast, max-level flying mount and using the detailed walkthrough, complete\n  with copy-and-paste waypoints, from the Wiki.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since I was on my Level 130 Berserker, all mobs in every required zone were\n  grey to me and non-aggressive. All I had to do was port, fly, gather and\n  return. It still took me two hours to finish all nine quests.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The quests themselves were exactly as they always are: gather some samples\n  from various parts of <i>Norrath </i>so some lazy/greedy/cowardly panda can\n  satisfy their curiosity/stuff themselves stupid. Bao Bao is quite an endearing\n  panda as these things go and the quest dialog was amusing enough but the most\n  interesting part to me is how long the dev team can keep the whole thing\n  going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a whole gang of pandas standing around in\n  <i>Sundered Frontier </i>now. I think there are three questgivers and two\n  vendors at least. When the thing started in 2017 there was only\n  <i>Yun Zi </i>handing out the quests and he did his own storekeeping.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/s1920/eq2pandas1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/w640-h360/eq2pandas1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Thanks to the wiki, I had very little trouble finding everything. Almost all\n  of the items were there in profusion. Most of them sparkled and some were\n  oversized. A couple were none of those things but the wiki warned me about\n  that and told me where to look, with accompanying screenshots.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The only part that gave me any real trouble was the quest that asked for some\n  foliage from <i>Lesser Feydark</i>. Lesser Fey is and always has been a total\n  pain to navigate. It has no portals at all accessible via map travel. The best\n  you can do is map to either <i>Butcherblock </i>and take a griffin from the\n  cliffs above the dock or port to <i>Greater Feydark</i> or\n  <i>Steamfont </i>and fly to the zone-in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I went via Butcherblock first, only to find that the BB entrance brings you in\n  on the opposite side of the map to where you want to go. I figured it would be\n  faster to map-travel to GFey and come back in from that side than to fly\n  across the whole of LFey so I did that and it wasn\'t.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d forgotten that you land in <i>Kelethin </i>and Kelethin has its own map\n  and I got myself lost coming out of the dumb elf tree city and ended up\n  wandering about for ages before I finally worked out where I was supposed to\n  be going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once in LFey it wasn\'t much better because the whole place is constructed from\n  a bunch of separate valleys with invisible walls preventing you from flying\n  between them. You have to follow rivers and go through tunnels and you can\'t\n  fly through most of the connections so you have to go on foot. The whole place\n  is a confusing, annoying mess and flying really doesn\'t make it any easier.\n</p>\n<p>So <i>that </i>was fun. I got it done eventually, anyway.</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that out of the way, I was finally able to get the first of this\n  year\'s quests, for which we will be collecting rocks, just for a change. It\n  turns out Bao Bao, who demonstrated his lack of self-control when it comes to\n  stuffing things in his mouth all through the 2024 questline, ate his way\n  through his grandmother\'s entire vegetable garden and now he needs to give her\n  some pretty rocks for her collection to get back on her good side.\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/s911/eq2pandagran2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/w640-h328/eq2pandagran2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\n  Guess who\'ll be doing the hard work lugging those rocks about. Muggins, that\'s\n  who.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And that brings me to the question, once again, of whether it will be worth\n  it. I looked at the first set of rewards, which include a bunch of purple\n  Augments, some weapons and the inevitable bags of decorating items and...\n  that\'s it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Usually there are full sets of armor for all weights and dozens of Augments,\n  along with a few other odds and ends, utilities and so on. I\'m not sure if\n  that means none of those things are going to be on the vendor this time or\n  whether they\'ll only appear week-by-week. And if they aren\'t going to be\n  there, does that mean there\'s going to be a substantial change to the way gear\n  works in the new expansion?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or does it just mean someone has finally admitted that handing out three full\n  sets of gear in three months, each of which upgrades the one before, is taking\n  generosity beyond the bounds of reason? If so, you can bet there will be howls\n  of complaint.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not that the dagger I took <i>does </i>upgrade the best one already available\n  to me, anyway. I took it because it\'s an upgrade for the weapon I was using\n  but I wasn\'t using the best weapon I own. I haven\'t claimed the weapon from\n  the Anniversary crate yet. The panda dagger won\'t upgrade that and if there is\n  panda armor this year and it has the same Resolve as the weapons, that won\'t\n  upgrade the anniversary gear, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, it will be much worse. The Anniversary stuff is 525 Resolve. The new\n  panda weapons are 505.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/s913/eq2pandagran1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/w640-h328/eq2pandagran1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nEven if we discount the Anniversary gear, which you only get for one character\non the account, Resolve 505 isn\'t going to cut it for long. As a casual soloist\nI already have lots of 495 pieces so it\'s a minimal upgrade and it will be\ninstantly rendered redundant the day the expansion arrives. I don\'t know what\nthe <i>Tishan</i>\'s gear will come in at but you can bet it will be at minimum\n505 and come with Augments that work in the new zones, which none of the old\nones will.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Some of that is speculation. This is, or should be, a level cap increase year.\n  Those are usually when things change the most so anything could happen when\n  the expansion arrives. As must be plain from everything I ever write about\n  EQII, the game is ferociously over-complicated, especially when it comes to\n  gear and stats. The team have been trying to strip away some of the accrued\n  cruft for a while now but every time they remove anything there\'s an outcry,\n  not least from the crew that claims to play EQII specifically\n  <i>because </i>it\'s complicated and difficult to understand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ll be doing the panda quests anyway. They\'re a fun little diversion and\n  don\'t take too long (Lesser Feydark always excepted.) and they unlock the\n  vendors for the whole account so it\'s a useful option for some of my\n  sub-max-level characters. Most of all, though, I don\'t want to fall behind\n  again.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Who knows, next year the pandas might come up with something different.

I had the opportunity to do just that yesterday, when I went to pick up\n  the first of this year\'s quests and found I hadn\'t finished last year\'s yet.\n  Or started them, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Technically, I <i>had </i>started the 2024 set of nine quests, but only in\n  that I\'d visited <i>Bao Bao</i>, the current Panda-in-Residence, and taken the\n  first one. It was in my Journal but I hadn\'t actually done anything about it\n  in twelve months. Bao Bao was not interested in giving me this year\'s quests\n  until I finished the job I was already on.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I had thought you could skip the ones you hadn\'t done. You\'d probably want to\n  if you were a new or returning player because the event has been running since\n  2017, meaning there are now seventy-two quests in the full sequence, not\n  counting the new ones this year. There are a lot of rewards from previous\n  years that still have some currency, not least the huge number of house items,\n  but the main thrust of the event has always been to gear up and who wants a\n  load of outdated armor with inferior stats?\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/wiki/The_%22Travels%22_of_Yun_Zi_Timeline">The wiki</a>\n  is somewhat confusing on whether you can skip the years you don\'t want to do:\n  "<i>Each of the quests must be completed in the order they were released,\n    starting with the quests from 2017. You cannot skip ahead to later points in\n    the quest series. </i><b><i>*2023 can be completed without previous progress in this questline.</i>"</b>&nbsp;(Emphasis theirs.) Why 2023 is different from the rest I couldn\'t tell\n  you but it doesn\'t seem to have been the start of a new, more relaxed ruleset\n  because this year\'s starter quest looked to be firmly gated behind completion\n  of last year\'s.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/s1916/eq2lfey1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFwZ545oo-I-6kJicgwbiTg3_DtRuiJF7vX6IclKI0GQFsHgbLltpx3TcCcV0abkXiZK0NyaLV0DsfYi1_c5nt1UuTh-CLKX1Gyf0t_kEnHRzj2HiikiiQox7EWwhLTo-sRfx82U55acVpAXtHqkStkqufd8u5kig2Yn1DsdwKl5MRmniztgmM3pK243I/w640-h302/eq2lfey1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I imagine the reason I thought you could skip was because in 2023 you really\n  could. Maybe I did. I haven\'t checked. I vaguely remember deciding last year\n  that, since I wasn\'t going to use any of the gear, I wouldn\'t bother doing the\n  quests. Or maybe that\'s post hoc rationalization. It\'s entirely possible I\n  just forgot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There were nine quests in the 2024 set. There are nine every year. It takes us\n  through the autumn to the arrival of the annual expansion, one quest dropping\n  every week after the regular update, usually, on a Tuesday. It\'s a pleasant\n  weekly ritual to get the new one, fly around for a few minutes ticking the\n  necessary boxes, then come back to see what new stuff you can grab off the\n  store-panda.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you let yourself fall behind, however, it all feels a bit less amusing.\n  Last night and this morning I did all nine quests. I did it the fastest way\n  possible, using my All Access Membership for instant travel to and from the\n  various zones, moving between the various locations within those zones on my\n  very fast, max-level flying mount and using the detailed walkthrough, complete\n  with copy-and-paste waypoints, from the Wiki.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since I was on my Level 130 Berserker, all mobs in every required zone were\n  grey to me and non-aggressive. All I had to do was port, fly, gather and\n  return. It still took me two hours to finish all nine quests.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The quests themselves were exactly as they always are: gather some samples\n  from various parts of <i>Norrath </i>so some lazy/greedy/cowardly panda can\n  satisfy their curiosity/stuff themselves stupid. Bao Bao is quite an endearing\n  panda as these things go and the quest dialog was amusing enough but the most\n  interesting part to me is how long the dev team can keep the whole thing\n  going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  There\'s a whole gang of pandas standing around in\n  <i>Sundered Frontier </i>now. I think there are three questgivers and two\n  vendors at least. When the thing started in 2017 there was only\n  <i>Yun Zi </i>handing out the quests and he did his own storekeeping.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/s1920/eq2pandas1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPTg5rsmr3VbMOsrBHsb0h-7BhY7_jjL5HQ7FpiMRv9bxapNNcfweef_J-Ga3gixiO8bkQYzYQg6Yu1b8Rs2OmHgCmfVgqs8hV7M-yoXROf7SIIvhc963dSwrChWT0UiQ9nQzyAr34Qh928EMhzGSFHizSvnZxfHdJAwkcwAkOq2X-8Iw8aAZ4am-unM8/w640-h360/eq2pandas1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Thanks to the wiki, I had very little trouble finding everything. Almost all\n  of the items were there in profusion. Most of them sparkled and some were\n  oversized. A couple were none of those things but the wiki warned me about\n  that and told me where to look, with accompanying screenshots.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  The only part that gave me any real trouble was the quest that asked for some\n  foliage from <i>Lesser Feydark</i>. Lesser Fey is and always has been a total\n  pain to navigate. It has no portals at all accessible via map travel. The best\n  you can do is map to either <i>Butcherblock </i>and take a griffin from the\n  cliffs above the dock or port to <i>Greater Feydark</i> or\n  <i>Steamfont </i>and fly to the zone-in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I went via Butcherblock first, only to find that the BB entrance brings you in\n  on the opposite side of the map to where you want to go. I figured it would be\n  faster to map-travel to GFey and come back in from that side than to fly\n  across the whole of LFey so I did that and it wasn\'t.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'d forgotten that you land in <i>Kelethin </i>and Kelethin has its own map\n  and I got myself lost coming out of the dumb elf tree city and ended up\n  wandering about for ages before I finally worked out where I was supposed to\n  be going.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once in LFey it wasn\'t much better because the whole place is constructed from\n  a bunch of separate valleys with invisible walls preventing you from flying\n  between them. You have to follow rivers and go through tunnels and you can\'t\n  fly through most of the connections so you have to go on foot. The whole place\n  is a confusing, annoying mess and flying really doesn\'t make it any easier.\n</p>\n<p>So <i>that </i>was fun. I got it done eventually, anyway.</p>\n<p>\n  With all of that out of the way, I was finally able to get the first of this\n  year\'s quests, for which we will be collecting rocks, just for a change. It\n  turns out Bao Bao, who demonstrated his lack of self-control when it comes to\n  stuffing things in his mouth all through the 2024 questline, ate his way\n  through his grandmother\'s entire vegetable garden and now he needs to give her\n  some pretty rocks for her collection to get back on her good side.\n</p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/s911/eq2pandagran2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-P3EOF91dVeTrvpXZVvy8OlwcKZ8klNjdvIx4M7ZU2-bTvPfamWdCcQfgIuIFBz-nKMftZhj3TXS83cImhRK_UkKqqwYq_yoBvzAMumVOQwpZWD-pDmLyhxByzhuiezIGGapVoRhj3JARuS9zwcVbc0ack3-2ZvYKvyV7UFq6w_siF5CoxAOpyVVRPS4/w640-h328/eq2pandagran2.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\n  Guess who\'ll be doing the hard work lugging those rocks about. Muggins, that\'s\n  who.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And that brings me to the question, once again, of whether it will be worth\n  it. I looked at the first set of rewards, which include a bunch of purple\n  Augments, some weapons and the inevitable bags of decorating items and...\n  that\'s it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Usually there are full sets of armor for all weights and dozens of Augments,\n  along with a few other odds and ends, utilities and so on. I\'m not sure if\n  that means none of those things are going to be on the vendor this time or\n  whether they\'ll only appear week-by-week. And if they aren\'t going to be\n  there, does that mean there\'s going to be a substantial change to the way gear\n  works in the new expansion?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Or does it just mean someone has finally admitted that handing out three full\n  sets of gear in three months, each of which upgrades the one before, is taking\n  generosity beyond the bounds of reason? If so, you can bet there will be howls\n  of complaint.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not that the dagger I took <i>does </i>upgrade the best one already available\n  to me, anyway. I took it because it\'s an upgrade for the weapon I was using\n  but I wasn\'t using the best weapon I own. I haven\'t claimed the weapon from\n  the Anniversary crate yet. The panda dagger won\'t upgrade that and if there is\n  panda armor this year and it has the same Resolve as the weapons, that won\'t\n  upgrade the anniversary gear, either.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In fact, it will be much worse. The Anniversary stuff is 525 Resolve. The new\n  panda weapons are 505.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\n  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/s913/eq2pandagran1.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO09B0JYILHCBZAwF6zdKZ5PpnWHB-bGf1oRpfurI2AHeNaJB_2hVUvnhm7xsDMMM9-AT-uqTbO0bGQ-pclkfto7RTKZKo62uize2VmyHNyAek6Tybk-DKKAnlblGIfuLgIBjIfkiJKIwcIDi5_x8BFmO-sGVoI7VeT9Zj1VFug_3nAmnKUTKU5MhAI5A/w640-h328/eq2pandagran1.jpg" width="640" /></a>\n</div>\nEven if we discount the Anniversary gear, which you only get for one character\non the account, Resolve 505 isn\'t going to cut it for long. As a casual soloist\nI already have lots of 495 pieces so it\'s a minimal upgrade and it will be\ninstantly rendered redundant the day the expansion arrives. I don\'t know what\nthe <i>Tishan</i>\'s gear will come in at but you can bet it will be at minimum\n505 and come with Augments that work in the new zones, which none of the old\nones will.\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  Some of that is speculation. This is, or should be, a level cap increase year.\n  Those are usually when things change the most so anything could happen when\n  the expansion arrives. As must be plain from everything I ever write about\n  EQII, the game is ferociously over-complicated, especially when it comes to\n  gear and stats. The team have been trying to strip away some of the accrued\n  cruft for a while now but every time they remove anything there\'s an outcry,\n  not least from the crew that claims to play EQII specifically\n  <i>because </i>it\'s complicated and difficult to understand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I\'ll be doing the panda quests anyway. They\'re a fun little diversion and\n  don\'t take too long (Lesser Feydark always excepted.) and they unlock the\n  vendors for the whole account so it\'s a useful option for some of my\n  sub-max-level characters. Most of all, though, I don\'t want to fall behind\n  again.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Who knows, next year the pandas might come up with something different. If\n  they do, it\'d be nice to be able to grab it right away instead of playing\n  catch-up first.\n</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/have-you-done-that-little-job-i-gave.html'}], 'link': 'https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/09/have-you-done-that-little-job-i-gave.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Bhagpuss)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Bhagpuss', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6VjUXTrxwVUVem4fP0CEGklW0ZKxvm_t77N3cqKlewPWTfDONQHEqczqtUHkKf8tAMeSqhMJlyL6g8qSIcnrF95DLHvGe4opHCZFBXvkSk-YXgPzpbigLUF7XC5Q-5Ku8k_xBfwuEkRbOGuWuEhn2Aa95jhOcc_gAbAtxGQzq9nEj_lP_6nfZBx5Y7BM/s72-w640-h360-c/eq2ppp1.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '6'}

That may be because pretty much all I <i>have </i>been listening to for months\n  is the music I\'ve been making myself with <i>Suno</i>.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I listen to my own songs every day.

I guess that\'s what\n  married life does for you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When I can tear myself away from the mirror, I have at least been keeping up\n  with some new music, here and there. It\'s all a little sporadic and random\n  and I haven\'t been doing a lot of trawling for tunes on my own, mostly relying\n  on news feeds to pop me hints, but I have collected a few good picks for the\n  post I\'m about to write.

Some of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  My late-blooming songwriting is very, very different from the stuff I was\n  doing back in the eighties.

What I\'m less sure about is whether that\'s a direct consequence\n  of my method, re-purposing prose, or if it\'s that I\'ve developed a different ear, listening to a lot of contemporary\n  artists. If I was one of those old guys who only ever listens to stuff they\n  liked when they were young, would everything I\'m doing now sound like it did\n  when I was doing it forty years ago?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I guess I don\'t need to care.

That may be because pretty much all I <i>have </i>been listening to for months\n  is the music I\'ve been making myself with <i>Suno</i>.&nbsp;\n<p></p>\n<p>\n  I listen to my own songs every day. On the desktop, on the laptop, in the car,\n  at work.

I guess that\'s what\n  married life does for you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When I can tear myself away from the mirror, I have at least been keeping up\n  with some new music, here and there. It\'s all a little sporadic and random\n  and I haven\'t been doing a lot of trawling for tunes on my own, mostly relying\n  on news feeds to pop me hints, but I have collected a few good picks for the\n  post I\'m about to write. Am writing. Have written, as I do the final edit.</p>\n<p>\n  Where to start? Something fast and loud is usually indicated to get the party started.

He\'s a producer based in London and Berlin (Like they all are if\n  they\'re not in New York or L.A.

I\'m not sure what\n  <i>Madi Gaines</i> would call what she\'s doing but not "<i>pop</i>", I imagine. The internet as a whole is\n  pretty convinced it\'s "<i>queer indie rock/shoegaze</i>".&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  A weird thing that\'s happening now is that I keep hearing songs by other\n  people that sound not unlike the songs I\'m making myself. This is one. It\'s\n  there in the rhythms and the phrasing and the intonation. Maybe I\'m making indie rock/shoegaze, too, although I\'m not about to appropriate the qualifying tag.\n  Then again, the characters in the songs, <i>they </i>would. Some of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  My late-blooming songwriting is very, very different from the stuff I was\n  doing back in the eighties. Better, I think, but then I would, or I wouldn\'t\n  keep doing it. What I\'m less sure about is whether that\'s a direct consequence\n  of my method, re-purposing prose, or if it\'s that I\'ve developed a different ear, listening to a lot of contemporary\n  artists. If I was one of those old guys who only ever listens to stuff they\n  liked when they were young, would everything I\'m doing now sound like it did\n  when I was doing it forty years ago?&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>I guess I don\'t need to care. I\'m not one of those guys. Thank god. I pray I never will be.</p>\n<p>\n  OK, it seems I had quite a few more tunes stacked up than I thought. This is\n  going to run long unless I watch myself. I think we\'ll have three more and save the rest for later. But which three?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Maybe not the same people that were in the last one.

While Microsoft has tried spinning the &#8220;value added&#8221; from things like free battlepasses to a few F2P games, most everything is the same or worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a couple of things I wanted to say about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the amount of &#8220;I told you so!&#8221;s from people &#8211; including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/as-microsoft-lays-off-thousands-and-jacks-up-game-pass-prices-former-ftc-chair-says-i-told-you-so-the-activision-blizzard-buyout-is-harming-both-gamers-and-developers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">former FTC chair Lina Khan</a> &#8211; who suggest the price increase is a result of the Activision Blizzard merger is kind of ridiculous. Yes, $55 billion is a lot of investment money that Microsoft expects a return on. <em>However</em>&#8230; do we imagine the Game Pass subscription was going to stay at the same level if the merger <em>didn&#8217;t</em> occur? Was Microsoft <em>not</em> going to lay off the same game devs as before? Subscriptions go up and to the right. It doesn&#8217;t take Nostradamus to predict that Netflix and Disney+ will have a(nother) price increase within the next two years, with or without any mergers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incidentally, the math on people canceling their subscriptions is interesting. Even if just under one-third of people cancelled their subscription&#8230; Microsoft <em>would still break even</em>. Hell, depending on the network traffic and other server costs, Microsoft probably comes out ahead even if half of everyone quits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the record, I&#8217;m not here to defend the price hikes or Microsoft in general. We are absolutely seeing an across-the-board decrease in Consumer Surplus as a result of this, and it behooves everyone to double-check their internal math to see if Game Pass still makes sense. If all you&#8217;re playing is Hollow Knight: Silksong for the month, well, you were better off just buying it outright. Even the &#8220;free&#8221; copy of Call of Duty is going to start costing you extra starting in month 3 versus 7+ now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let&#8217;s not pretend that where we&#8217;re at today wasn&#8217;t worth how we got here. Microsoft was going to Microsoft <em>anyway</em>. The fact that we got to enjoy a comparatively cheap way to play videogames for years and years was phenomenal. The party is over now? Oh no, back to&#8230; buying videogames again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compare that to what&#8217;s going to happen when the AI music inevitably stops.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://inanage.com/2025/10/16/price-hike/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e7719ed015b5aabeef04fa3af9dbfccc005de2a8d664feacf23a3883cacb8364?s=96&d=&r=R', 'medium': 'image'}]}

And it <em>repulses</em> me in an uncanny valley way. Takes me right out of whatever hypnosis I was under and immediately causes me to close the tab. Which, of course, is great for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put &#8220;presumed&#8221; up there though, because sometimes I cannot really tell. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCcToUcCSXQ" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">this video</a> about &#8220;15 forgotten garden traditions&#8221; is <em>probably</em> AI generated &#8211; it features generic voiceover on top of stitched-together montage of others peoples&#8217; (at least attributed) content. Much like the now-maligned em dash however, perhaps that style of video is now just guilty by association? Another video was on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTOccll2XGM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The Saver&#8217;s Paradox</a> and my AI-dar went off immediately. Looking further into the channel and thinking about what it would require to prompt that level of video though, it seems like it&#8217;s legit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps neither of those videos bothered you in the slightest. In which case, congratulations! You are absolutely set up for a future filled to the brim with&#8230; content. For me though, the magic is gone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may well be inevitable that the quality of AI generation is such that it become indistinguishable from human content. In which case, why would I be on Youtube at all, instead of in my own prompt? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-correcting!

Which, to be fair, is primarily due to the FOMO elements. The introduction of the new Legendary gloves you can get for running Quickplay versions of the early Fractals will be sticking around, but there&#8217;s another &#8220;reward track&#8221; that grants two Bag space slots, a 20-slot bag, and a Legendary starter kit that will be going away on October 7th. Theoretically, you can still grind most/all of it by the time this post goes Live, but I have enjoyed gaining some extra progress &#8211; via Daily/Weekly achievement resets &#8211; by spacing things out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is probably some debate to be had as to whether adding the Quickplay feature to Fractals will lead to more players doing Fractals after the event ends. Honestly&#8230; maybe? It certainly has demystified the game mode to an extent, as my normal M.O. for this sort of group content would be to watch YouTube videos to understand all the mechanics before even stepping inside. That sort of thing is not particularly viable when Quickplay has like 10ish options randomly picked for you. Of course, everything has been toned way down for the game mode, so you get the gist after seeing the maps several times even if you aren&#8217;t reading text (since everyone is Go-Go-Go). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gw2_wizardvault.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17806" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gw2_wizardvault.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A little agency goes a long way</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another piece of &#8220;content&#8221; I have very much enjoyed is the Wizard&#8217;s Vault. This is a rework of the Daily Achievements (read: daily quests) system with a fancy new interface and currency called Astral Acclaim. It was very annoying at first, as it had a mixture of PvE and PvP objectives, but once I figured out that you can uncheck the PvP box and get all PvE-based objectives, everything was grand. You have both Daily and Weekly tabs you can work on, and then you have a large menu of rewards to choose from that eventually reset every quarter or whatever. So, for example, you can choose to spend Astral Acclaim on certain cosmetics, or a Legendary starter kit, or a bag containing 1g (x90), or your choice of an Ascended Weapon, and so on. The Weekly tab requires six objectives to get the big bonus chest, but there are eight total options so you even have some choice to skip ones you find annoying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing I haven&#8217;t done is purchase any expansion content. For one thing, Visions of Eternity is right around the corner (Oct 28). While $25 is not onerous for an MMO expansion, purchasing three of them back-to-back is another matter. Plus, you know how I am: why pay full price when the expansions were literally on sale at the beginning of the month? I missed that boat, but I&#8217;m assuming there will be another sale around launch day. Of course, waiting is always kind of risky, as I could easily come to my senses and start playing other things again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Fake Edit]</strong> Steam Autumn sale is on, and now those two expansions are $17.50 and $19.99. Huzzah!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing I haven&#8217;t (yet) started in on are unlocking Legendaries. In pretty much every guide out there, the recommendation is for players to <em>not</em> do weapon or armor Legendaries first, but instead go for accessories (rings, amulet, etc). This makes some sense, as accessories apply to every character you ever make, whereas armor is broken up into weight classes (can&#8217;t use Light Armor Legendary on your Thief). Weapon Legendaries can apply to multiple characters&#8230; but not if they are off-meta or off-spec. Well, this is GW2, so meta probably doesn&#8217;t <em>really</em> matter all that much.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gw2_birthday.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17808" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gw2_birthday.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">My original character celebrating 12 years&#8230; camping a daily Jumping Puzzle chest, as god intended</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the &#8220;problem&#8221; is that I have effectively decked out all my alts in Ascended accessories already. It&#8217;s been like seven years <a href="https://inanage.com/2018/02/20/finding-the-zone/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">since this post</a>, but farming Winterberries an unholy amount of times will get you most everything you need. Berserker stats won&#8217;t help Viper builds, but as long as you alternate what you get your alts, you can usually just shuffle the accessories around each time balance patches change the math. Grinding out Vision or Aurora or whatever may provide a little QoL bump, but it will not actually improve any stats. So, dilemma. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, I will continue what I&#8217;m doing for as long as it remains fun. Which it is. For now. Although, I came across <a href="https://inanage.com/2021/12/13/priorities/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">this &#8220;resolution&#8221;</a> while looking up past GW2 posts, and&#8230; yeah.

On the other hand, I didn&#8217;t necessary want to pay $30 for more GW2, so I took that as a sign to uninstall and do something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I did. Another expansion came out called Janthir Wilds, and I let that one pass me by too. It even featured the ability to have a decorative house, introduced a spear weapon for every class, and so on. Neat. Have fun with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is even yet another expansion coming out in October called Visions of Eternity. I think there are even new Elite specs this time around. Haven&#8217;t really looked into too far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why am I writing about GW2, and in fact have reinstalled the game? <strong>They finally introduced LFD</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s technically a beta feature, but it&#8217;s called Quickplay, and it&#8217;s the same automated group finder feature from WoW circa 16 years ago. Press button, get an instant 5-man squad and teleport right next to them. Right now, it is pointing towards even-easier versions of T1 Fractals, but presumably it will be expanded in the future to actual dungeons, perhaps Strikes, maybe raids? Moreover, ArenaNet has erected an extremely generous set of Achievements surrounding spam-queueing T1 Fractals for the next several weeks, resulting in extra bag slots, a Legendary glove (!!), and other such goodies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As dumb as it sounds, yeah, reading about Quickplay (and the rewards, obviously) is what pushed me over the edge into downloading GW2 again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;sorta.

If I&#8217;m not committing to something, why not <em>not</em> commit to something that <em>could</em> possibly be relevant in the future? Then again, Guild Wars 3 is going to be a thing at some point, rendering everything moot.

We&#8217;ve seen a lot of feedback about the strong neutral package of Fyrakk, Elise, Naralex, and Ysera, and we&#8217;ll be keeping a close eye on them moving forward. We&#8217;ve also continued to hear suggestions to buff nearly every new Quest so they become competitive archetypes. However, as we&#8217;ve shared before, too many competitive Quests in the long term can lead to a metagame that isn&#8217;t fun or healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More broadly, we believe future expansions are a better place to bring community feedback to life than trying to overhaul the current set through balance patches. We fell short of our goal of introducing enough new competitive options this expansion. As we look ahead to the next expansion and beyond, we&#8217;re keeping your response to this set in mind and are using it to help shape the future of Hearthstone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you are unaware, the Hearthstone devs <strong>chose to bring Quest cards back</strong>. As in, they created 11 <em>Legendary cards</em>, put them into digital packs, and then sold them in FOMO $50/$80 bundles. Now, I understand the notion of &#8220;pack filler&#8221; and such in CCGs&#8230; but it still boggles my mind that they reintroduced an entire archetype (presumably for nostalgia reasons) despite wanting it to be non-competitive from the start. This is on top of the overall &#8220;toning down&#8221; of the power level of the last few sets, leading to goddamn <em>Wisp</em> being a core card in the current meta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people express concern about power creep, e.g. the tendency of devs to make new stuff stronger than existing stuff. While that is a problem, it&#8217;s more of a conceptual one rather than real. This is because, fundamentally, both the devs and players want the same thing: to play with new cards. If the new sets are weak, players get stuck playing with the old cards. Nevermind all the people who got scammed spending real money buying the new cards the devs intentionally designed to be bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m over here struggling to come up with equivalent comparisons capable of highlighting exactly how dumb the situation is. An MMO expansion featuring worse gear than what players already had? Or maybe a new talent tree that is worse at healing/tanking/DPS than what existed before? I could still imagine some people wanting such an expansion simply for the story and new playstyle, so it does not quite fit the situation with Hearthstone. Competition against other players is the only thing you got in terms of content. So, even if you wanted to experience new deck archetypes, the result is that you will just lose. Badly. Some of these new decks had winrates in the 20-30% range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really have to hand it to Blizzard though. What other company can fail this spectacularly, so many times in a row, and still have the audacity to put out $158 cosmetics? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s really just us players that are dumb.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://inanage.com/2025/09/18/designed-to-fail/feed/', 'slash_comments': '4', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e7719ed015b5aabeef04fa3af9dbfccc005de2a8d664feacf23a3883cacb8364?s=96&d=&r=R', 'medium': 'image'}]}

This time around, you can build a corvette-class ship that will allow you to&#8230; get up and walk around in your ship. That might not sound like much, but it is actually kind of rare even in space games, especially considering you do so with no loading screens. In any case, I decided I need to give things another go after 5 (five!) years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I encountered was <em>still</em> one of the worst opening sequences for almost any game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I apparently have never commented on it before, but NMS starts with you awakening on an alien planet, your suit powering up, and then a number of warnings about your environmental protection waning. Conceptually, this is fine; other survival games start you out in imminent danger too. For example, ARK has you awakening on a beach and sometimes being eaten by a raptor right away. In NMS&#8217;s case though, it just feels&#8230; bad. Your visor scanner doesn&#8217;t work, sometimes you don&#8217;t spawn near required resources to refill your environmental protection, and you don&#8217;t have the terrain modification gun yet which otherwise trivializes most hostile weather (e.g. dig a tunnel and get underground).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_field.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17731" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_field.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Can still be a very beautiful game, of course</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Worse, I actually tried starting things back up by immediately choosing an Expedition. Big mistake. Expeditions were added to the game several patches ago, and they are basically more focused experiences where you start out on predefined planets and need to accomplish specific goals. The problem is that these are absolutely tuned more for advanced players with a good grasp of the underlying mechanics. Well, and the <em>other</em> problem is that everyone is thrown into the same subsets of planets, so you might spawn in an area where everyone has mined most of the nearby ore. More annoyingly to me though, is that when you are looking around for resources, you&#8217;re bombarded with dozens of (useless) player base icons, making finding things difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, don&#8217;t do what I did. Instead, get a foothold in the game and <em>then</em> go into an Expedition &#8211; including bringing some good loot in with you! &#8211; via a vendor you unlock a few hours in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, since I hate myself, I chose to start a brand new save on Survival difficulty. C&#8217;mon, I had 130+ hours logged already, right? Beginning is brutal, as mentioned, and you have to contend with some extra nonsense like smaller stack sizes for material, etc. Within about 15 hours though, I&#8217;m back to having 22 million units, 6000 nanites, and unlocking all 10 freighter storage racks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_space2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17732" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_space2.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Space: the only frontier with gameplay</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No Man&#8217;s Sky has indeed improved tremendously over the years, but fundamentally it <em>does</em> still have a problem with &#8220;but&#8230; why?&#8221; It&#8217;s the same place <a href="https://inanage.com/2020/10/15/still-no-mans-sky/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">I landed on five years ago</a>, and unfortunately it does not appear much has changed. Well, OK, there have been a lot of changes. Expeditions, there are now Dissonant planets with corrupted Sentinels, there is a Settlement system, Pirate Dreadnaughts to fight/own, the new bespoke Corvette-class ship building system, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fundamentally, though? When you&#8217;re on foot, none of the randomly-generated creatures matter; only Sentinels pose any threat whatsoever, and there are only like a half-dozen types. Why even have so many different kinds of weapons for your multi-tool if only one is needed to take down every enemy? Meanwhile, if you spend more than 30 seconds in space, you&#8217;re likely to be accosted by fleets of hostile pirates that will absolutely murder you if given half a chance. The space gameplay &#8220;loop&#8221; is not particularly deep, but nevertheless feels miles more complete than what you are doing in the other 80% of the game, e.g. walking on planets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said all that&#8230; yeah, 130+ hours plus however many I muster this time around. I&#8217;m harsh on the game because I&#8217;m mad. Hello Games have added so much and just inexplicably left such a gaping hole in the center and I don&#8217;t understand <em>why</em>. Maybe having Gek pirates running around on foot blasting you would feel too weird or whatever, but apparently it&#8217;s fine when they&#8217;re faceless ships? OK, just use some of the six trillion randomized alien creatures and make some of them require that fancy mech to fight! Or lean more into those bug aliens that are apparently as ubiquitous as the Sentinels for (presumably) some kind of lore reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, I guess, ignore all that and hurry up and give me <a href="https://inanage.com/2023/12/12/light-some-fires/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Light No Fire</a>. </p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://inanage.com/2025/09/11/old-mans-sky/feed/', 'slash_comments': '2', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e7719ed015b5aabeef04fa3af9dbfccc005de2a8d664feacf23a3883cacb8364?s=96&d=&r=R', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_2020.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_field.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nms_space2.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Impressions:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nintendo Switch itself</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there was technically a way to hook up a Switch to a TV and not need the dock, but I decided to bring the dock as well. I was extremely wary of the dock snapping in half somewhere &#8211; given its U shape &#8211; but it&#8217;s either stronger than it looks or I&#8217;m luckier than I look. Packing it in my carry-on instead of a checked bag probably helped. Everything else was in a travel case that held up beautifully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not to belabor the point much, but the Switch was very portable; I doubt anyone is packing a PS5 into a carry-on or whatever for a one-week trip. The last time I felt comfortable traveling with a &#8220;regular&#8221; game console somewhere was in the GameCube era, when I&#8217;d bring that to-and-fro over college breaks. If there was an appropriate use case, this was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the games we played, we exclusively used the&#8230; half controller (?) configuration. Pretty awkward controller for me, but it was OK for the types of games we were playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mario Kart 8</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Started out with Mario Kart to try and leave a good impression with a game that had a lot of replay value. Kid was ready to give it up after a couple circuits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Near as I can tell, there are two degrees of Assist Mode when it comes to Mario Kart 8. The first appears to be a generalized &#8220;automatically stay on the track.&#8221; You can still fly off if struck by something while airborne, but I believe the game otherwise keeps you from getting turned around or going out of bounds. The second level of assist is acceleration. For sure, I had this turned off for myself, even though I&#8217;m not certain <em>how</em>. My son, meanwhile, was otherwise able to leisurely putter around with only minor course (mis)corrections when the mood struck him. I had heard from a friend that Assist Mode is sometimes able to win races all by itself, but I did not at all see that in the 50cc difficulty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My own impressions of the game &#8220;for real&#8221; will have to wait for a later opportunity. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Super Mario Bros Wonder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the first real hit with the child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way two-player works is its own sort of Assist Mode. One player has the &#8220;crown&#8221; and the camera follows them, pushing the other(s) along if they go off-screen. If someone falls down a pit or hits an enemy, they return as a floating ghost with a 5-second timer. Connect with an alive player in time and they will respawn with no loss of lives. Additionally, if someone is controlling Yoshi or a rabbit-looking dude, they become immune to dying by enemies&#8230; but cannot transform with power-ups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, what I have come to realize is that platformers are, you know, kinda hard for kids. Somehow we all made it through back in the day, sure, but <em>god damn</em>. Hate to even think about what our parents had to go through listening to us die in the original Mario Bros. Maybe that&#8217;s why they beat us with belts and/or shut us outside until after dark?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Super Mario Bros Odyssey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Odyssey is what we played after Wonder, and is the clear favorite currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Assist Mode for Odyssey is that there are blue arrows showing where the player should go next, and I <em>think</em> that the penalty for falling into a pit is more relaxed (just 1 less heart vs&#8230; something else). Additionally, the second player gets to control the hat, which can be pretty cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the platforming is not especially designed for a 6-year old here either, so there are some sequences when he wanted me to take over. Even being the hat was tricky, as you have to contend with having your perspective change if Mario moves around. Plus, sometimes you have to use the hat <em>right now</em> to prevent damage or make the boss vulnerable, or whatever. It&#8217;s a big responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re getting pretty close to &#8220;Bowser Wowser&#8221; as he&#8217;s been christened though, and my guy is having more fun watching than playing sometimes. We&#8217;ll see how things shake out in a couple weeks/months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Super Smash Bros Ultimate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Didn&#8217;t actually get around to this one, despite my asking him several times if he wanted to try a different game. My guess is that he could still have fun on a team with daddy against whatever the equivalent of a bunch of Level 1 CPU Jigglypuffs there are in this one. Probably still Jigglypuffs. </p>'}], 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e7719ed015b5aabeef04fa3af9dbfccc005de2a8d664feacf23a3883cacb8364?s=96&d=&r=R', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I mentioned &#8220;closed-world&#8221; instead of &#8220;linear&#8221; earlier because while the game does have an generally predefined path &#8211; as opposed to something like ARK &#8211; you get to unlock doors and open up shortcuts that will make backtracking more convenient. And there is indeed some backtracking required to collect additional resources to fuel your science machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have found that the way resources are handled is&#8230; mostly acceptable. Just about everything in the facility can be stripped down for parts, but once they are gone, they are gone. In the meantime, you will find portals to various &#8220;anteverses&#8221; that you need to explore and complete. These portals are similar to the general facility in that they are more linear but you can unlock shortcuts for subsequent visits. Emphasis on subsequent visits. Twice every in-game week all portals reset themselves, including any items therein. To an extent, this does lend itself towards a sort of resource speed-run that gets tiresome after a while, especially when you&#8217;re looking for just one particular thing (Staplers, Glue, etc).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand: what other survival-crafting game doesn&#8217;t require farming some resources?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_angryrobot.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17685" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_angryrobot.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Truly in the &#8220;find out&#8221; part of this encounter</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One element I have been surprised about is how well the devs maintained a sense of positive progression. In the beginning, the night is indeed dark and full of terrors &#8211; electricity is shut off, hostile security bots patrol, and you&#8217;re mostly sitting in the corner somewhere praying the noises of unknown source will just stop. After a while, you learn how to craft batteries and traps and makeshift barriers, creating a safe(r) space for yourself. Exploring further afield leads to longer return trips, which sucks. Then you make a cart, where you can stack your loot and push it back to base. Or you unlock a particularly helpful shortcut cutting down on the commute. You start creating forward bases instead of bringing everything with you. Finally, slightly past the mid-game&#8230; absolute bliss. Let&#8217;s just say you still need to explore new areas, but returning somewhere is no longer a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, the general lethality of the game remains high even on Normal difficulty. You can be well armed and provisioned, but some enemies will still be able to take you out in short order. In the endgame where I am, some of the enemies have become a bit bullet-spongy too, but I&#8217;m not <em>too</em> mad about it because the difficulty of each encounter is largely in your hands. Having trouble clearing a room? How about setting up a bunch of turrets in the doorway and let them duke it out instead of you? There are power sockets in a bunch of places in the facility, and even if there aren&#8217;t, you can always bring your own fully-charged batteries. While not quite on the level of Prey, Abiotic Factor does give you a similar level of freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_mist.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17687" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_mist.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Yeah, maybe just keep sneakin&#8217;</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the negative side, the game is not afraid of sometimes setting you up against (mostly) invulnerable enemies. Usually these act more as mobile traps/hazards, but a not insignificant portion of the game is spent being stalked by the equivalent of a Boo from Mario. It&#8217;s spooky and provides plenty of dynamic jump scare opportunities at first&#8230; and then the game keeps going for another 20 hours before you get something that can grant you peace. But surprise! There&#8217;s another at the endgame. Sigh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another downside comes from some lingering rough edges from Early Access. The devs have been very quick with hotfixes to patch various bugs, which is great. But there are some things that need some more love, or semblance of purpose. For example, there are several dozen cooking recipes with complex/rare ingredients that barely provide more sustenance than basic ones. Some weapons serve no discernable purpose, being weaker than what you had access to before. There are several endgame Sharp weapons, but no Blunt ones. Speaking of which, the late game annoyingly introduces you to new weapons and then immediately enemies that are resistant to their damage. Like&#8230; why?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_shotgun.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-17688" height="562" src="https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_shotgun.jpg?w=1000" width="1000" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Used this baby for quite some time</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all fixable problems though, and the devs seem like reasonable people thus far. I&#8217;m excited to hear what they have in store for v1.1 and beyond. Mostly. Because at the end of the day, I am very clearly nearing the end of the game. Clocking more than 130 hours is certainly sufficient for my money&#8217;s worth, but I&#8217;m nevertheless sad that starting over is unlikely to generate the same novel experience. This is where a more traditional, rogue-like survival game (e.g. 7 Days to Die, Minecraft, etc) might pull ahead in the long-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said all that, well&#8230; one hundred and thirty goddamn hours. Abiotic Factor is legit. It&#8217;s one of the most novel survival-crafting experiences I have had since Subnautica, and reminded me why I love the genre so much. Play now or play later, but I recommend playing it. Also, it&#8217;s on Game Pass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e7719ed015b5aabeef04fa3af9dbfccc005de2a8d664feacf23a3883cacb8364?s=96&d=&r=R', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_juice.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_angryrobot.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_mist.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://inanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/abioticfactor_shotgun.jpg?w=1000', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Here’s how.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">The Nadia story</h2>\n    <p>This is a vision of what success looks like.</p>\n    <p>Nadia lives in LA.\n    She has a popular social-media account with a reputation for stylish pictures of urban\n    life. She’s not terribly political, just a talented street photog. Her handle is “CoolTonesLA@hotpix.example”.</p>\n    <p>She’s in Venice Beach the afternoon of Sunday August 9, 2026, when federal agents take down a vendor selling\n    cheap Asian ladies’ wear. She gets a great shot \n    of an enforcer carrying away an armful of pretty dresses while two more bend the merchant over his countertop.\n    None of the agents in the picture are in uniform, all are masked.</p>\n    <p>She signs into her “CoolTonesLA” account on <code>hotpix.example</code> and drafts a post saying “Feds raid Venice\n    Beach”. When she uploads \n    the picture, there’s a pop-up asking “Sign this\n    image?” Nadia knows what this means, and selects “Yes”. By midnight her post has gone viral.</p>\n    <img alt="Content Credentials glyph" class="inline" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/cr.png" />\n    <p>As a result of Nadia agreeing to “sign” the image, anyone who sees her post, whether in a browser or mobile app,  also\n    sees that little “Cr” badge in the photo’s top right corner. \n    When they mouse over it, a little pop-up says something like:</p>\n    <blockquote class="popup"><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Signature is valid.<br />Media was posted by <span class="fakelink">@CoolTonesLA</span><br />on \n    <span class="fakelink">hotpix.example</span><br />at 5:40 PM PDT, August 9th, 2026.</p></blockquote>\n    <p>The links point to Nadia’s feed and her instance’s home page. Following them can give the reader a feeling\n    for what kind of person she is, the nature of her server, and the quality of her work. Most people are inclined to believe the\n    photo is real.</p> \n    <p>Marco is a troublemaker. He grabs Nadia’s photo and posts it to his social-media account with the caption\n    “Criminal illegals terrorize local business. Lock ’em up!”  He’s not technical and doesn’t strip the metadata. Since the\n    picture is already signed, he doesn’t get the “Sign this picture?” prompt.\n    Anyone who sees his post will see the “Cr” badge and mousing over it makes it pretty clear that it isn’t what he says it\n    is. Commenters gleefully point this out.  By the time Marco takes the post down, his credibility is\n    damaged.</p>\n    <p>Maggie is a more technical troublemaker. She sees Marco’s post and likes it, strips the picture’s metadata, and reposts it. \n    When she gets the “Sign this picture?” prompt, she says “No”, so it doesn’t get\n    a “Cr” badge. Hostile commenters accuse her of posting a fake, saying “LOL badge-free zone”. It is less likely that her\n    post will go viral.</p> \n    <p>Miko isn’t political but thinks the photo would be more dramatic if she Photoshopped it to add a harsh dystopian lighting\n    effect. When she reposts her version, the “Cr” badge won’t be there because the pixels have changed.</p>\n    <p>Morris follows Maggie. He grabs the stripped picture and, when he posts it, says “Yes”\n    to signing. In his post the image will show up with the “Cr” and credit it to him, with a “posted” timestamp later than Nadia’s initial\n    post. Now, the \n    picture’s believability will depend on Morris’s. Does he have a credible track record?\n    Also, there’s a chance that someone will notice what Morris did and point out that he stole Nadia’s picture.</p>\n    <p>(In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if people ran programs against the social-network firehose looking for media signed by more than\n    one account, which would be easy to detect.)</p>\n    <p>That’s the Nadia story.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">How it’s done</h2>\n    <p>The rest of this piece explains in some detail how the Nadia story can be supported by technology that\n    already exists, with a few adjustments. If jargon like “PKIX” and “TLS” and “Nginx” is foreign to you, you’re unlikely to\n    enjoy the following. Before you go, please consider: Do you think making the Nadia story come true\n    would be a good investment?</p>\n    <p>I’m not a really deep expert on all the bits and pieces, so it’s possible that I’ve got something wrong. Therefore, this\n    blog piece will be a living document in that I’ll correct any convincingly-reported errors, with the goal that it\n    accurately describes a realistic technical roadmap to the Nadia story.</p>\n    <p>By this time I’ve posted enough times about C2PA that I’m going to assume people know what it is and how it works. For my long,\n    thorough explainer, see\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/10/28/C2PA-Workflows">On C2PA</a>. Or, check out the\n    <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/">Content Credentials Web site.</a></p>\n    <p>Tl;dr: C2PA is a list of assertions about a media object, stored in its metadata, with a digital signature that includes the\n    assertions and the bits of the picture or video.</p>\n    <p>This discussion assumes the use of C2PA and also an in-progress specification from the\n    <a href="https://cawg.io">Creator Assertions Working Group</a> (CAWG) called\n    <a href="https://cawg.io/identity/1.2-draft">Identity Assertion</a>.</p>\n    <p>Not all the pieces are quite ready to support the Nadia story. But there’s a clear path forward to closing each gap.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">“Sign this picture?”</h2>\n    <p>C2PA and CAWG specify many assertions that you can make about a piece of media. For now let’s focus just on what we\n    need for provenance. \n    When the media is uploaded to a social-network service, there are two facts that the server knows,\n    absolutely and unambiguously: Who uploaded it (because they’ve had to sign in) and when it happened.</p>\n    <p>In the current state of\n    the specification drafts, “Who” is the <code>cawg.social_media</code> property from the draft\n    <a href="https://cawg.io/identity/1.2-draft/#vc-credentialsubject-verifiedidentity-type">Identity Assertion spec, section\n    8.1.2.5.1</a>, and “When” is the <code>c2pa.time-stamp</code> property from the\n    <a href="https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_requirements_2">C2PA\n    specification, section 18.17.3</a>.</p>\n    <p>I think these two are all you need for a big improvement in social network  media provenance,\n    so let’s stick with them.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">What key?</h2>\n    <p>Let’s go back to the Nadia story.\n    It needs the Who/When assertions to be digitally signed in a way that will convince a tech-savvy human or a PKIX validation\n    library that the signature could only have been applied by the server at <code>hotpix.example</code>.</p>\n    <p>The C2PA people have been thinking about this. They are working on a\n    <a href="https://iptc.org/verified-news-publishers-list/">Verified News Publishers List</a>, to be maintained and managed by,\n    uh, that’s not clear to me. The idea is that C2PA software would, when validating a digital signature, require\n    that the PKIX cert is one of those on the Publishers List.</p>\n    <p>This isn’t going to work for a decentralized social network, which has tens of thousands of independent servers\n    run by co-ops, academic departments, municipal governments, or just a gaggle of friends who kick in on Patreon. And anyhow,\n    Fediverse instances don’t claim to be “News Publishers”, verified or not.</p>\n    <p>So what key can <code>hotpix.example</code> sign with?\n    Fortunately, there’s already a keypair and PKIX certificate in place on every social-media server, the one it uses to\n    support TLS connections. The one at <code>tbray.org</code>, that’s being used right now to protect your interaction\n    with this blog, is in <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/</code> and the private key is obviously not generally readable.</p>\n    <p>That cert will contain the public key corresponding to the host’s private key, the cert\'s ancestry, and the host name.\n    It’s all that any PKIX library needs to verify that yes, this could only have been signed by\n    <code>hotpix.example</code>. However, there will be objections.</p>\n    <p><b>Objection</b>: “<code>hotpix.example</code> is not a Verified News Publisher!” True enough, the C2PA validation libraries would\n    have to accept X.509 certs. Maybe they do already? Maybe this requires an extension of the current specs? In any\n    case, the software’s all open-source, could be forked if necessary.</p>\n    <p><b>Objection</b>: “That cert was issued for the purpose of encrypting TLS connections, not for some weird photo provenance\n    application. Look at the\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_identifier">OID</a>!” OK, but seriously, who cares?\n    The math does what the math \n    does, and it works.</p>\n    <p><b>Objection</b>: “I have to be super-careful about protecting my private key and I don’t want to give a copy to the hippies\n    running the social-media server.” I sympathize but, in most cases, social media is all that\n    server’s doing.</p>\n    <p>Having said that, it would be great if there were extensions to Nginx and Apache httpd where you could request\n    that they sign the assertions for you. Neither would be rocket science.</p>\n    <p>OK, so we sign Nadia’s Who/When assertions and her photo’s pixels  with our host’s TLS key, and ship it off into the\n    world. What’s next?</p> \n    <h2 id="p-5">How to validate?</h2>\n    <p>Verifying these assertions, in a Web or mobile app, is going to require a C2PA library to pick apart the assertions and\n    a PKIX library for the signature check.</p>\n    <p>We already have\n    <a href="https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs">c2pa-rs</a>, Rust code with MIT and Apache licenses.\n    Rust libraries can be called\n    from some  other programming languages but in the normal course of affairs I’d expect there soon to be native implementations.\n    Once again, all these technologies are old as dirt, absolutely no rocket science required.</p>\n    <p>How about validating the signatures?  I was initially puzzled about this one because, as a\n    programmer, certs only come into the picture when I do something like <code>http.Get()</code> and the\n    library takes care of all that stuff. So I can’t speak from experience.</p>\n    <p>But I think the infrastructure is there.  Here’s a Curl blogger praising\n    <a href="https://eissing.org/icing/posts/curl-apple-sectrust/">Apple SecTrust</a>. Over on Android, there’s\n    <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/X509ExtendedTrustManager">X509ExtendedTrustManager</a>.\n    I assume Windows has something. And if\n    all else fails, you could just download a trusted-roots file from the\n    <a href="https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html">Curl</a> or\n    <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/ca-certificates/+/master/files/">Android</a> projects and refresh it\n    every week or two.</p> \n    <h2 id="p-7">What am I missing?</h2>\n    <p>This feels a little too easy, something that could be done in months not years. Perhaps I’m oversimplifying.\n    Having said that, I think the most important thing to get right is the scenarios, so we know what effect we want to achieve.</p>\n    <p>What do you think of the Nadia story?</p>'}]}

But I’ll try to entertain while prognosticating.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Reverse Centaurs</h2>\n    <p>That’s the title of a\n    <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/commentary-cory-doctorow-reverse-centaurs/">Cory Doctorow</a> essay, which I think is spot\n    on. I’m pretty sure anyone who’s read even this far would enjoy it and it’s not long, and it’d help understand this.\n    Go have a look, I’ll wait.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Hallucinations won’t get fixed</h2>\n    <p>I have one good and one excellent argument to support this prediction. Good first: While my understanding of LLMs is not\n    that deep, it doesn’t have to be to understand that it’s really difficult (as in, we don’t know how) to connect the model’s\n    machinations to our underlying reality, so as to fact-check.</p>\n    <p>The above is my non-expert intuition at work. But then there’s\n    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04664">Why Language Models Hallucinate</a>, three authors from OpenAI and one from Georgia\n    Tech, which seems to show that hallucinations are an inevitable result of current training practices.</p>\n    <p>And here’s the excellent argument: If there were a way to eliminate the hallucinations, <em>somebody already would\n    have</em>. An army of\n    smart, experienced people, backed by effectively infinite funds, have been hunting this white\n    whale for years now without much success. My conclusion is, don’t hold your breath waiting.</p>\n    <p>Maybe there’ll be a surprise breakthrough next Tuesday. Could happen, but I’d be really surprised.</p>\n    <p>(When it comes to LLMs and code, the picture is different; see below.)</p>\n    <h2 id="p-1">The mass layoffs won’t happen</h2>\n    <p>The central goal of GenAI is the elimination of tens of millions of knowledge workers.\n    That’s the only path to the profits that can cover the costs of training and\n    running those models.</p>\n    <p>To support this scenario the AI has to run in Cory’s “reverse centaur” mode, where the models do the work and the\n    humans tend them. This allows the production of several times more work per human, generally of lower quality, with inevitable\n    hallucinations. There are two problems here: First, that at least some of the output is\n    <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity">workslop</a>, whose cleanup costs eat away at\n    the productivity wins.\n    Second, that the lower quality hurts your customers and your business goes\n    downhill.</p>\n    <p>I just don’t see it. Yeah, I know, every CEO is being told that this will work and they’ll be heroes to their\n    shareholders. But the data we have so far keeps refusing to support those productivity claims.</p>\n    <p>OK then, remove the “reverse” and run in centaur mode, where smart humans use AI tools judiciously to improve productivity\n    and quality. Which might be a good idea for some people in some jobs.\n    But in that scenario neither the output boost nor the quality gain get you to where you can dismiss enough\n    millions of knowledge workers to afford the AI bills.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">The financial damage will be huge</h2>\n    <p>Back to Cory, with <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/27/econopocalypse/#subprime-intelligence">The real (economic) AI\n    apocalypse is nigh</a>. It’s good, well worth reading, but at this point pretty well conventional wisdom as seen by everyone who\n    isn’t either peddling a GenAI product or (especially) fundraising to build one.</p>\n    <p>To pile on a bit, I’m seeing things every week like for example this:\n    <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/23/ai-boom-unsustainable-tech-spending-parabolic-deutsche-bank/">The AI boom is\n    unsustainable unless tech spending goes ‘parabolic,’ Deutsche Bank warns: ‘This is highly unlikely’</a>.</p>\n    <p>The aggregate investment is ludicrous. The only people who are actually making money are the ones\n    <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e93e56df-dd9b-40c1-b77a-dba1ca01e473">selling the gold-mining equipment</a> to the peddlers.\n    Like they say,\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Stein#Stein\'s_Law">“If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.”</a> Where\n    by “forever”, in the case of GenAI, I mean “sometime in 2026, probably”.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">… But the economy won’t collapse</h2>\n    <p>Cory forecasts existential disaster, but I’m less worried.\n    Those most hurt when the bubble collapses will be the investing classes who, generally speaking, can afford it. \n    Yeah, if the S&amp;P 500 drops by a third, the screaming will shake the heavens, but I honestly don’t see it hitting as hard as\n    2008 and don’t see how the big-picture economy falls apart. That work that the genAI shills say would be automated away is still\n    gonna have to be done, right?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">The software profession will change, but not <em>that</em> much</h2>\n    <p>Here’s where I get in trouble, because a big chunk of my professional peers, including people I admire, see\n    GenAI-boosted coding as pure poison:\n    <a href="https://anthonymoser.github.io/writing/ai/haterdom/2025/08/26/i-am-an-ai-hater.html">“In a kind of nihilistic symmetry,\n    their dream of the perfect slave machine drains the life of those who use it as well as those who turn the gears.”</a> (The\n    title of that essay is “I Am An AI Hater.”)</p>\n    <p>I’m not a hater.\n    I argued above that LLMs generating human discourse have no way to check their output for consistency with\n    reality. But if it’s code, “reality” is approximated by what will compile and build and pass the tests. The agent-based systems\n    iteratively generate code, reality-check it, and don’t show it to you until it passes. One consequence is that the\n    quality of help you get from the model should depend on the quality of your test framework. Which warms my\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/05/15/Testing-in-2021">testing-fanatic</a> heart.</p>\n    <p>So, my first specific prediction: Generated code will be a routine thing in the toolkit, going forward from here. It’s pretty\n    obvious that LLMs are better at predicting code sequences than human language.</p>\n    <p>In <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer">Revenge of the junior developer</a>, Steve Yegge\n    says, more or less, “Resistance is useless. You will be assimilated.” But he’s wrong; there are going to be places where we\n    put the models to work, and others where we won’t. We don’t know which places those are and aren’t, but I have (weaker)\n    predictions; let’s be honest and just say “guesses”.</p>\n    <p>Where I suspect generated code will likely appear:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>Application logic: “Depreciate the values in the <code>AMOUNT</code> field of the <code>INSTALLED</code> table forward\n      ten years and write the <code>NAME</code> field and the depreciated value into a CSV.” Or “Look at JIRA ticket 248975 and\n      create a fix.”</p>\n      <p>(By the way, this is a high proportion of what actual real-world programmers do every day.)</p></li>\n      <li><p>Glorified StackOverflow-style lookups like I did in\n      <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/01/First-AI-Code">My First GenAI Code</a>.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Drafting code that needs to run against interfaces too big and complex to hold in your head, like for example the\n      Android and AWS APIs (“When I shake the phone, grab the location from GPS and drop it in the <code>INCOMING</code> S3 bucket”). Or\n      CSS (“Render that against a faded indigo background flush right, and hold it steady while scrolling so the text slides around\n      it”).</p></li>\n      <li><p>SQL. This feels like a no-brainer. So much klunky syntax and so many moving pieces.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Where I suspect LLM output won’t help much.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>Interaction design. I mean, c’mon, it requires predicting how humans understand and behave.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Low level infrastructure code, the kind I’ve spent my whole life on, where you care a whole lot about about conserving\n      memory and finding sublinear algorithms and shrinking code paths and having good  benchmarks.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Here are areas where I don’t have a prediction but would like to know whether and how LLM fits in (or not).</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>Help with testing: Writing unit and integration tests, keeping an eye on coverage, creating a bunch of BDD tests from a\n      verbal description of what a function is going to do.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Infrastructure as code: CI/CD, Terraform and peers, all that stuff. There are so many ways to get it wrong.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Bad old-school concurrency that uses explicit mutexes and <code>java.lang.Thread</code> where you have to understand\n      language memory models and suchlike.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 id="p-7">The real reason not to use GenAI</h2>\n    <p>Because it’s being sold by a panoply of grifters and chancers and financial engineers who know that the world where their dreams\n    come true would be generally shitty, and they don’t care.</p>\n    <p>(Not to mention the environmental costs and the poor folk in the poor countries where the QA and safety work is\n    outsourced.)</p>\n    <p>Final prediction: After the air goes out of the assholes’ bubble, we won’t have to live in the world they imagine. Thank\n    goodness.</p>'}]}

Today I represent… nobody, <em>officially</em>. I’m not on any of the committees nor am I an\n    employee of any of the providers. But I’m a photographer and software developer and social-media activist and have written a lot about\n    C2PA. So under all those hats this is a subject I care about.</p>\n    <p>Also, I posted this on Twitter back in 2017.</p>\n    <img alt="Twitter post from 2017 presaging C2pA" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/2017-twitter.png" />\n    <p>I’m not claiming that I was the first with this idea, but I’ve been thinking about the issues for quite a while.</p>\n    <p>Enough self-introduction. Today I’m going to look at C2PA in practice right now in 2025. Then I’m going to talk about what I\n    think it’s for. Let’s start with a picture.</p>\n    <img alt="Picture of a shopping mall storefront" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/L1000004.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>This smaller version doesn’t have C2PA,<br />but if you click on it, the larger version you get does.\n    <br />Photo credit: Rob Pike</p></div>\n    <p>I should start by saying that a few of the things that I’m going to show you are, umm, broken. But I’m still a C2PA fan. Bear\n    in mind that at this point everything is beta or preview or whatever, at best v1.0. I think we’re in glass-half-full mode.</p>\n    <p>This photo is entirely created and processed by off-the-shelf commercial products and has content credentials, and let me say\n    that I had a freaking hard time finding such a photo. There are very few Content Credentials out there on the Internet. That’s\n    because nearly every online photo is delivered either via social media or by professional publishing software. In both cases, the\n    metadata is routinely stripped, bye-bye C2PA. So one of the big jobs facing us in putting Content Credentials to work is to stop\n    publishers from deleting them.</p>\n    <p>Of course, that’s complicated. Professional publishers probably want the Content Credentials in place, but on social media\n    privacy is a key issue and stripping the metadata is arguably a good default choice. So there are a lot of policy discussions to\n    be had up front of the software work.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, let’s look at the C2PA. </p>\n    <img alt="Picture with two Content Credentials glyphs and one drop-down" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/ca-glyphs-1.png" />\n    <p>I open up that picture in Chrome and there are little “Cr” glyphs at both the top left and top right corners; that’s because\n    I’ve installed multiple C2PA Chrome plug-ins. Turns out these seem to only be available for Chrome, which is irritating. Anyhow,\n    I’ve clicked on the one in the top left.</p> \n    <p>That’s a little disappointing. It says the credentials were recorded by Lightroom, and gives my name, but I think it’s hiding\n    way more than it’s revealing. Maybe the one on the top right will be more informative?</p>\n    <img alt="Picture with two Content Credentials glyphs and one drop-down" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/ca-glyphs-2.png" />\n    <p>More or less the same info. A slightly richer presentation But both displays have an “inspect” button and both do the same\n    thing. Let’s click it!</p>\n    <img alt="Content Credentials inspector page, failing to retrieve a page for review" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/broken-inspector.png" />\n    <p>This is the Adobe Content Credentials inspector and it’s broken. That’s disappointing. Having said that, I was in a Discord\n    chat with a senior Adobe person this morning and they’re aware of the problem.</p>\n    <p>But anyhow, I can drag and drop the\n    picture like they say.</p>\n    <img alt="Content credentials as displayed by the Inspector" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/2-phase-c2pa.png" />\n    <p>Much much better. It turns out that this picture was originally taken with a Leica M11-P. The photographer is a famous software\n    guy named Rob Pike, who follows me on Mastodon and wanted to help out.</p>\n    <p>So, thanks Rob, and thanks also to the Leica store in Sydney, Australia, who loaned him the M11. He hasn’t told me how he\n    arranged that, but I’m curious.</p>\n    <p>I edited it in Lightroom, and if you look close, you can see that I cropped it down and brightened it up. Let’s zoom in on\n    the content credentials for the Leica image.</p>\n    <img alt="Leica-generated C2PA display" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/leica-cc.png" />\n    <p>There’s the camera model, the capture date (which is wrong because Rob didn’t get around to setting the camera’s date before\n    he took the picture.) The additional hardware (R-Adapter-M), the dimensions, ISO, focal length, and shutter speed.</p>\n    <p>Speaking as a photographer, this is kind of cool. There’s a problem in that it’s partly wrong. The focal length isn’t zero,\n    and Rob is pretty sure he didn’t have an adapter on. But Leica is trying to do the right thing and they’ll get there.</p>\n    <p>Now let’s look at the assertions that were added by Lightroom.</p>\n    <img alt="Lightroom-generated C2PA display" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/lr-cc.png" />\n    <p>There’s a lot of interesting stuff in here, particularly the provenance. Lightroom lets you manage your identities, using\n    what we call “OAuth flows”, so it can ask Instagram (with my permission) what my Instagram ID is. It goes even further with\n    LinkedIn; it turns out that LinkedIn has an integration with the Clear ID people, the ones who fast-track you at the airport. So\n    I set up a Clear ID, which required photos of my passport, and went through the dance with LinkedIn to link it up, and then with\n    Lightroom so it knew my LinkedIn ID. So to expand, what it’s really saying is: “Adobe says that LinkedIn says that Clear says\n    that the government ID of the person who posted this says that he’s named Timothy Bray”.</p>\n    <p>I don’t know about you, but this feels like pretty strong provenance medicine to me. I understand that the C2PA committee and\n    the\n    <a href="https://cawg.io">CAWG</a> people are re-working the provenance assertions. To them: Please don’t screw this particular\n    style of provenance up.</p>\n    <p>Now let’s look at what Lightroom says it did. It may be helpful to know what I in fact did.</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Cropped the picture down.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Used Lightroom’s “Dehaze” tool because it looked a little cloudy.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Adjusted the exposure and contrast, and boosted the blacks a bit.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Sharpened it up.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>Lightroom knows what I did, and you might wonder how it got from those facts to that relatively content-free\n    description that reads like it was written by lawyers.\n    Anyhow, I’d like to know. Since I’m a computer geek, I used the open-source “c2patool” to dump what the assertions\n    actually are.  I apologize if this hurts your eyes.</p>\n    <p>It turns out that there is way more data in those files than the inspector shows. For example, the Leica claims included 29\n    EXIF values, here are three I selected more or less at random:</p>\n    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p"></span><span class="w">          </span><span class="nt">"exif:ApertureValue"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"2.79917"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">          </span><span class="nt">"exif:BitsPerSample"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"16"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">          </span><span class="nt">"exif:BodySerialNumber"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"6006238"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n</pre></div>\n    <p>Some of these are interesting: In the Leica claims, the serial number. I could see that as a useful provenance claim. Or as a\n    potentially lethal privacy risk. Hmmm.</p>\n        <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p"></span><span class="w">            </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.color_adjustments"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.color_adjustments"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr.value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"60"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Exposure2012"</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="p">}</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">},</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.color_adjustments"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Sharpness"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr.value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"52"</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="p">}</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">},</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"action"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"c2pa.cropped"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="nt">"parameters"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr.value"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Rotated Crop"</span><span class="p">,</span>\n<span class="w">                </span><span class="nt">"com.adobe.acr"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Crop"</span>\n<span class="w">              </span><span class="p">}</span>\n<span class="w">            </span><span class="p">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n    <p>And in the Lightroom section, it actually shows exactly what I did, see the sharpness and exposure values.</p> \n    <p>My feeling is that the inspector is doing either too much or too little. At the minimal end you could just say “hand\n    processed? Yes/No” and “genAI? Yes/No”.  For a photo professional, they might like to drill down and see what I actually did. I\n    don’t see who would find the existing presentation useful. There’s clearly work to do in this space.</p>\n    <p>Oh wait, did I just say “AI”? Yes, yes I did. Let’s look at another picture, in this case a lousy picture.</p>\n    <img alt="Picture of an under-construction high-rise behind leaves" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/TXT55638.png" />\n    <p>I was out for a walk and thought the building behind the tree was interesting. I was disappointed when I pulled it up on the\n    screen, but I still liked the shape and decided to try and save it.</p>\n    <img alt="Picture of an under-construction high-rise behind leaves, improved" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/TXT55638-good.png" />\n    <p>So I used Lightroom’s “Select Sky” to recover its color, and “Select Subject” to pull the building details out of the\n    shadows. Both of these Lightroom features, which are pretty magic and I use all the time, are billed as being AI-based. I\n    believe it.</p>\n    <p>Let’s look at what the C2PA discloses.</p>\n    <img alt="Lightroom C2PA assertions with automation AI" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/lr-tower.png" />\n    <p>Having said all that, if you look at the C2PA (or at the data behind it) Lightroom discloses only “Color or Exposure”,\n    “Cropping”, and “Drawing” edits. Nothing about AI.</p>\n    <p>Hmm. Is that OK? I personally think it is, and highlights the distinction between what I’d call “automation” AI and\n    Generative AI. I mean, selecting the sky and subject is something that a skilled Photoshop user could accomplish with a lot of\n    tinkering, the software is just speeding things up. But I don’t know, others might disagree.</p>\n    <p>Well, how about that generative AI?</p>\n    <img alt="Turtle in shallow water, generated by ChatGPT" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/chatgpt.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>Fails <code>c2patool</code> validation, “DigitalSourceType” is <code>trainedAlgorithmicMedia</code></p></div>\n    <img alt="Desktop with decorations, Magic Erase has been applied" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/budai.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>“DigitalSourceType” is <code>compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia</code></p></div>\n    <p>The turtle is 100% synthetic, from ChatGPT, and on the right is a Pixel 10 shot on which I did a few edits including “Magic\n    Eraser”.  Both of these came with Content Credentials; chatGPT’s is actually invalid, but on the glass-half-full front, the\n    Pixel 10’s were also invalid up until a few days ago, then they fixed it. So this stuff does get fixed.</p>\n    <p>I’m happy about the consistent use of C2PA terminology, they are clearly marking the images as genAI-involved.</p>\n    <p>I’m about done talking about the state of the Content Credentials art generally but I should probably talk about this\n    device.</p>\n    <img alt="Blue Pixel 10" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/pixel-10.png" />\n    <p>Because it marks the arrival of Content Credentials on the mass consumer market. Nobody knows how many Pixels Google actually\n    sells but I guarantee it’s a lot more than Leica sells M11’s. And since Samsung tends to follow Google pretty closely, we’re\n    heading for tens then hundreds of millions of C2PA-generating mobile devices. I wonder when Apple will climb on board?</p>\n    <p>Let’s have a look at that C2PA.</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA associated with Magic Eraser image" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/p10-c2pa.png" />\n    <p>This view of the C2PA is from the Google Photos app.  It’s very limited.  In particular, there is nothing in there to support\n    provenance. In fact, it’s the opposite, Google is bending over backward to avoid anything that could be interpreted as breaking the\n    privacy contract by sharing information about the user.</p>\n    <p>Let’s pull back the covers and dig a little deeper. Here are a few notes</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>The device is identified just as “Pixel camera”. There are lots of different kinds of those!</p></li>\n      <li><p>The C2PA inclusion is Not optional!</p></li>\n      <li><p>DigitalSourceType:  <code>computationalCapture</code>\u2028(if no genAI)</p></li>\n      <li><p>Timestamp is “untrusted”</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>The C2PA not being optional removes a lot of UI issues but still, well, I’m not smart enough to have fully thought through\n    the implications. That Digital Source Type looks good and appropriate, and the untrusted-ness of the timestamp is\n    interesting.</p>\n    <p>You notice that my full-workflow examples featured a Leica rather than the Pixel, and that’s because the toolchain is\n    currently broken for me: Neither Lightroom nor Photoshop can handle the P10 C2PA. I’ll skip the details, except to say that\n    Adobe is aware of the bug, a version mismatch, and they say they’re working on it.</p>\n    <p>Before we leave the Pixel 10, I should say that there are plenty of alternate camera apps in Android and iOS, some quite\n    good, and it’d be perfectly possible for them to ship much richer C2PA, notably including provenance, location, and so on.</p>\n    <p>I guess that concludes my look at the current state of the Content Credentials art. Now I’d like to talk about what Content\n    Credentials are for.  To start with, I think it’d be helpful to sort the assertions into three baskets.</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA assertions in Capture, Processing, and Provenance baskets" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/3-baskets-1.png" />\n    <p>Capture, that’s like that Leica EXIF stuff we showed earlier. What kind of camera and lens, what the shooting parameters\n    were. Processing, that’s like the Lightroom report: How was the image manipulated, and by what software. Provenance: Which\n    person or organization produced this?</p>\n    <p>But I think this picture has an important oversimplification, let me fix that.</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA assertion baskets with the addition of GenAI" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/3-baskets-2.png" />\n    <p>Processing is logically where you’d disclose the presence of GenAI.  And in terms of what people practically care about,\n    that’s super important and deserves special consideration.</p>\n    <p>Now I’m going to leave the realm of facts and give you opinions. As for the Capture data there on the left… who cares?\n    Really, I’m trying to imagine a scenario in which anyone cares about the camera or lens or F stop.  I guess there’s an exception\n    if you want to prove that the photo was taken by one of Annie Liebowitz’s cameras, but that’s really provenance.</p>\n    <p>Let’s think about a professional publication scenario. They get photos from photographers, employees or agencies or\n    whatever. They might want to be really sure that the photo was from the photographer and not an imposter. So having C2PA\n    provenance would be nice. Then when the publisher gets photos, they do a routine check of the provenance and if it doesn’t check\n    out, they don’t run the picture without a close look first.</p>\n    <p>They also probably want to check for the “is there genAI?” indicator in the C2PA, and, well, I don’t know what they might do,\n    but I’m pretty sure they’d want to know.</p>\n    <p>That same publisher might want to equip the photos they publish with C2PA, to demonstrate that they are really the ones who\n    chose and provided the media. That assertion should be applied routinely by their content management system.  Which should be\n    easy, on the technology side anyhow.</p> \n    <p>So from the point of view of a professional publisher, provenance matters, and being careful about GenAI matters, and in the\n    C2PA domain, I think that’s all that really matters.</p>\n    <p>Now let’s turn to Social Media, which is the source of most of the images that most people see most days.  Today, all the\n    networks strip all the photo metadata, and that decision involves a lot of complicated privacy and intellectual-property\n    thinking.  But there is one important FACT that they know: For any new piece of media, they know which account uploaded the damn\n    thing, because that account owner had to log in to do it. So I think it’s a no-brainer that IF THE USER WISHES, they can have a\n    Content Credentials assertion in the photo saying “Initially uploaded by Tim Bray at LinkedIn” or whoever at wherever.</p> \n    <p>What we’d like to achieve is that if you see some shocking or controversial media, you’d really want to know who originally\n    posted it before you decided whether you believed it, and if Content Credentials are absent, that’s a big red flag. And if the\n    picture is of the current situation in Gaza, your reaction might be different depending on whether it was originally from an\n    Israeli military social-media account, or the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, or by the BBC, or by\n    igor282356057@popular.online.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, here’s how I see it:</p>\n    <img alt="C2PA assertion baskets inflated according to their relative importance" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/18/3-baskets-3.png" />\n    <p>So for me, it’s the P and A in C2PA that matter – provenance and authenticity. I think the technology has the potential to\n    change the global Internet conversation for the better, by making it harder for liars to lie and easier for truth-tellers to be\n    believed. I think the first steps that have been taken so far are broadly correct and the path forward is reasonably clear. All\n    the little things that are broken, we can fix ’em.</p>\n    <p>And there aren’t that many things that matter more than promoting truth and discouraging lies.</p>\n    <p>And that’s all, folks.</p>'}]}

On top of which, they’re thinly populated, fewer than two million souls in three provinces. The biggest city,\n    Halifax (and the entire province of Prince Edward Island) are both smaller than individual Vancouver suburbs. It’s not a place\n    for savouring urban flavors.</p>\n    <p>In Nova Scotia, Halifax has too many cruise ships; stay away from its so-called “farmers market” unless you love cruise\n    culture. Lunenberg is big enough to soak up its waves of visitors and still offer unique visuals.</p>\n    <img alt="Tourists at Peggy’s Cove" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/13/TXT55847.png" />\n    <img alt="The cove at Peggy’s Cove" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/13/TXT55848.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>Overcrowded but has nice bits.</p></div>\n    <p>Peggy’s Cove I just can’t recommend; beautiful but jam-packed\n    with cars looking for parking and people risking their lives on the rocks.</p>\n    <img alt="Fort Anne in Annapolis Royal" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/13/PXL_20250822_163228719.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>These were once defences but now just a pleasant walk.</p></div>\n    <p>I do recommend visiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis_Royal">Annapolis Royal</a>; it’s got that great garden\n    and Fort Anne, despite its lengthy and chequered military history, is lovely and peaceful.</p> \n    <p>In PEI, Charlottetown makes an effort and it has a beautiful basilica, but just isn’t big enough to reward a whole day’s\n    visit.</p>\n    <p>In NB, Moncton is OK but its biggest tourist attraction is the tide going in and out.</p>\n    <img alt="Crowded tidal flat at Hopewell Provincial Park" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/13/TXT55961.png" />\n    <img alt="Clifftop forest at Hopewell Provincial Park" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/13/TXT55966.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>Hopewell Provincial Park, NB.

Also the breakfast was solid.</p>\n    <img alt="Sky drama over Lake Ainsley" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/13/PXL_20250813_113114060.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>Excited clouds over Lake Ainsley, NS.</p></div>\n    <p>But the trip’s lodging highlight was this VRBO called\n    <a href="https://www.vrbo.com/en-ca/cottage-rental/p9830781">Forest Lake House</a> on Lake\n    Ainsley, the Maritimes’ biggest.

There’s a color story there\n    too.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-1">Residentials</h2>\n    <p>As it happens, our very first outing on the vacation was to\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunenburg,_Nova_Scotia">Lunenberg</a>, which features those cheerful houses.</p>\n    <img alt="Brightly colored houses in Lunenberg" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/01/TXT55826.png" />\n    <p>It wasn’t just tourist magnets like Lunenberg; anywhere in the Maritimes you’re apt to see exuberantly-painted\n    residences, a practice I admire. While the Maritimes are a long way from my home in Vancouver, we share a long, dim, grey\n    winter, and any splash of color can help with that Seasonal Affective Disorder.</p>\n    <p>Also, we\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/02/28/Moved">recently bought a house</a> and, while we like it, it’s an undistinguished\n    near-grey, so we’re looking for color schemes to steal.\n    Thus I took lots of pictures of bright houses.</p>\n    <img alt="Apricot-and-brown house" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/01/PXL_20250822_180516990.png" />\n    <img alt="Blue house in Lunenberg" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/01/TXT55828.png" />\n    <p>A couple years back we painted our cabin a cheery blue based on sampling photos of the shutters on Mykonos.

PEI in\n    particular is famous for its red dirt, when you come in the on the ferry from Nova Scotia the first thing you notice is the\n    island’s red fringe. I took a million pictures and maybe this is the closest to capturing it.</p>\n    <img alt="Red sand and dirt on a PEI beachfront" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/01/TXT55948.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>Not far from that first picture.</p></div>\n    <h2 id="p-3">Green Conundrum</h2>\n    <p>One of Nova Scotia’s attractions is the\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabot_Trail">Cabot Trail</a>, a 300km loop around Cape Breton, stretching northeast out\n    into the Atlantic. This one scenic turn-off has you looking at a big, densely-forested mountainside. \n    It’s more chaotic than our West-Coast temperate rain forests, with many tree species jumbled together. The\n    spectrum of greens under shifting clouds was a real treat for the eyes. Here are two of the pictures I came away with.\n    Have a look at them for a moment.</p>\n    <img alt="Forested mountainside" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/01/PXL_20250813_161053505.png" />\n    <img alt="Forested mountainside" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/09/01/TXT55881.png" />\n    <p>Above is by my Pixel 7, below a modern Fujifilm camera.  When I unloaded them on the\n    big outboard screen, I was disappointed with the Fujifilm take, which seemed a little flat and boring; was thinking the Pixel had\n    done better. But then I started feeling uneasy; my memory kept telling me that that mountainside just\n    didn’t include that yellow flavor in the Pixel’s highlights. I mean, those highlights look great, but I’m pretty sure they’re lies.</p>\n    <p>After a while, I edited the Fujifilm version just a teeny bit, gently bumping Lightroom’s “exposure” and “Vibrance” sliders, and\n    I thought what \n    I got was very close to what I remembered. The Pixel photo is entirely un-touched.</p>\n    <p>I’m not sure what to think. Mobile-phone cameras in general and the Pixel in particular proudly boast their “computational\n    photography” and “AI” chops and, yeah, the Pixel produced a photo that it’s hard not to like.</p>\n    <p>And quite a few of the pictures I publish in this space have have been adjusted pretty heavily in Lightroom. I stand by my\n    claim that I’m mostly trying to make something that looks like what I saw. But increasingly, I suspect the Pixel is showing\n    colors people like, as opposed to what’s real.</p>'}]}

It explains which characters are bad, and why, then offers\n    three plausible less-bad subsets that you might want to use.\n    Herewith a bit of background, but…</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Please</h2>\n    <p>If you’re actually working on something new that will have text fields, please read the RFC. It’s only ten pages long, and that’s\n    with all the IETF boilerplate. It’s written specifically for software and networking people.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">The smoking gun</h2>\n    <p>The badness that 9839 focuses on is “problematic characters”, so let’s start with a painful example of what that means.\n    Suppose you’re designing a protocol that uses JSON and one of your constructs has a <code>username</code> field.\n    Suppose you get this message (I omit all the non-<code>username</code> fields). It’s \n    a perfectly legal JSON text:</p>\n    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>\n  <span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">"username"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"\\u0000\\u0089\\uDEAD\\uD9BF\\uDFFF"</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>    </pre></div>\n    <p>Unpacking all the JSON escaping gibberish reveals that the value of the <code>username</code> field contains four \n    numeric “code points” identifying Unicode characters:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>The first code point is zero, in Unicode jargon <code>U+0000</code>. In human-readable text it\n      has no meaning, but it will interfere with the operation of certain programming languages.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Next is Unicode <code>U+0089</code>, official name “CHARACTER TABULATION WITH JUSTIFICATION”. It’s what Unicode calls a\n      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes">C1\n      control code</a>, inherited from ISO/IEC 6429:1992, adopted from \n      <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-48_5th_edition_june_1991.pdf">ECMA 48</a> (1991), which calls it\n      “HTJ” and says: <i>HTJ causes the contents of the active field (the field in the presentation component that contains the\n      active presentation position) to be shifted forward so that it ends at the character position preceding the\n      following character tabulation stop. The active presentation position is moved to that following character\n      tabulation stop. The character positions which precede the beginning of the shifted string are put into the\n      erased state.</i></p>\n      <p>Good luck with that.</p></li>\n      <li><p>The third code point, <code>U+DEAD</code>, in Unicode lingo, is an “unpaired surrogate”.  To understand,\n      you’d have to learn how Unicode’s much-detested\n      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF-16</a> encoding works.\n      I recommend not bothering.</p>\n      <p>All you need to know is that surrogates are only meaningful when they come in pairs in UTF-16 encoded text. There is\n      effectively no such text on the wire and thus no excuse for tolerating surrogates in your data. In fact, the UTF-8 specification\n      says that you mustn’t use UTF-8 to encode surrogates. But the real problem is that different libraries in different\n      programming languages don’t always do the same things when they encounter this sort of fœtid interloper.</p>    </li>\n      <li><p>Finally, <code>\\uD9BF\\uDFFF</code> is JSON for the code point <code>U+7FFFF</code>.\n      Unicode has a category called “noncharacter”, containing a few dozen code points that, for a variety of\n      reasons, some good, \n      don’t represent anything and must not be interchanged on the wire. <code>U+7FFFF</code> is one of those.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>The four code points in the example are all clearly problematic. \n    The just-arrived RFC 9839 formalizes the notion of “problematic” and\n    offers easy-to-cite language saying which of these problematic types you want to\n    exclude from your text fields. Which, if you’re going to use JSON, you should probably do.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Don’t blame Doug</h2>\n    <p>Doug Crockford I mean, the inventor of JSON.  If he (or I or really anyone careful) were inventing JSON now that Unicode is\n    mature, he’d have been fussier about its character repertoire. Having said that, we’re stuck with JSON-as-it-is forever, so we\n    need a good way to say which of the problematic characters we’re going to exclude even if JSON allows them.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">PRECISion</h2>\n    <p>You may find yourself wondering why the IETF waited until 2025 to provide help with Bad Unicode.\n    It didn’t; here’s\n    <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8264.html">RFC 8264</a>: <cite>PRECIS Framework: Preparation, Enforcement, and\n    Comparison of Internationalized Strings in Application Protocols</cite>; the first PRECIS predecessor was published in 2002.\n    8264 is 43 pages long, containing a <em>very</em>\n    thorough discussion of many more potential Bad Unicode issues than 9839 does.</p>\n    <p>Like 9839, PRECIS specifies subsets of the Unicode character repertoire and goes further, providing a mechanism for defining\n    more.</p>\n    <p>Having said that, PRECIS doesn’t seem to be very widely used by people who are defining new data structures and protocols. My\n    personal opinion is that there are two problems which make it hard to adopt. First, it’s large and \n    complex, with many moving parts, and requires careful study to understand. Developers are (for good reason) lazy.</p>\n    <p>Second, using PRECIS ties you to a specific version of Unicode. In particular, it forbids the use of the (nearly a million)\n    unassigned code points. Since each release of Unicode includes new code point assignments, that means that a sender and receiver\n    need to agree on exactly which version of Unicode they’re both going to use if they want reliably interoperable behavior. This\n    makes life difficult for anyone writing a general-purpose code designed to be used in lots of different applications.</p>\n    <p>I personally think that the only version of Unicode anybody wants to use is “as recent as possible”, so they can be confident\n    of having all the latest emojis.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, 9839 is simpler and dumber than PRECIS. But I think some people will find it useful and now the IETF agrees.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">Source code</h2>\n    <p>I’ve written a little Go-language library to validate incoming text fields against each of the three subsets that 9839\n    specifies,\n    <a href="https://github.com/timbray/RFC9839">here</a>.  I don’t claim it’s optimal, but it is well-tested.</p>\n    <p>It doesn’t have a version number or release just yet, I’ll wait till a few folk have had a chance to spot any dumb mistakes I\n    probably made.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-9">Details</h2>\n    <p>Here’s a compact summary of the world of problematic Unicode code points and data formats and standards.</p>\n    <table>\n      <tr align="center" valign="top"><td class="empty"></td><th colspan="3">Problematic classes excluded?</th></tr>\n      <tr valign="top"><td class="empty"></td><th>Surrogates</th><th>Legacy controls</th><th>Noncharacters</th></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>CBOR</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>I-JSON</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="happy">yes</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>JSON</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>Protobufs</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>TOML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>XML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="neutral">partial [1]</td><td class="neutral">partial [2]</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>YAML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="neutral">mostly [3]</td><td class="neutral">partial [2]</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center" valign="top"><td class="empty"></td><th colspan="3">RFC 9839 Subsets</th></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>Scalars</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="unhappy">no</td><td class="unhappy">no</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>XML</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="neutral">partial</td><td class="neutral">partial</td></tr>\n      <tr align="center"><td>Assignables</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="happy">yes</td><td class="happy">yes</td></tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>Notes:</p>\n    <p><b>[1]</b> XML allows C1 controls.</p>\n    <p><b>[2]</b> XML and YAML don’t exclude the noncharacters outside the Basic Multilingual Pane.</p>\n    <p><b>[3]</b> YAML excludes all the legacy controls except for the mostly-harmless <code>U+0085</code>, another version of\n    <code>\\n</code> used in IBM mainframe documents.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">Thanks!</h2>\n    <p>9839 is not a solo production.

Then I ran across the 2019 book\n    <a href="https://www.biblioasis.com/shop/non-fiction/bush-runner-the-life-and-times-of-pierre-esprit-radisson/">Bush Runner:\n    The Adventures of Pierre-Esprit Radisson</a> and, wow… The writing is pedestrian but who cares because what a\n    story! Radisson lived an absolutely astonishing life. He went as deep into the bush as anyone of his era, interacted intensely\n    with the indigenous people as business partner, friend, and foe, worked for Charles of England and Louis of France (changing\n    sides several times), in 1670 founded the Hudson’s Bay Company (recently, 355 years later, deceased), and fortunately took\n    notes, a copy of which was preserved by Samuel Pepys.</p>\n    <p>I learned more from this book’s pages about the early history of Upper and Lower Canada than all those elementary-school\n    units had to offer, and had loads of fun doing so.  I guess this is a fairly Canadian-specific Long Link, but I think anyone\n    interested in the early history of Europeans in North America would find much to enjoy.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Music</h2>\n    <p>It’s rare these days that I discover interesting new musicians, but here are two of those rarities.</p>\n    <p><a href="https://luciehorsch.com">Lucie Horsch</a> plays recorder, you know, the cheap plastic thing they use to introduce\n    second-graders to music. It’s actually a lovely instrument and I wish we would switch to its German name, \n    “Blockflöte”, which to my ear sounds a bit like the instrument does. Anyhow, check out this YouTube entitled only\n    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJyl2D16PZY&amp;list=RDLJyl2D16PZY&amp;start_radio=1">Lucie Horsch\xa0-\xa0Bach</a>,\n    annoyingly omitting any mention of <em>which</em> Bach. Annoyance aside, it’s a pretty great performance, Ms Horsch is the real\n    deal, full of virtuosity and grace.</p>\n    <p>I got an unusual mid-week message from Qobuz, all excited about \n    <a href="https://transgressiverecords.com/artist/the-new-eves/">The New Eves’</a> new record <cite>The New Eve Is\n    Rising</cite>. So I played it in the car on a long crosstown drive and now I’m all excited too. The New Eves are\n    talented, musically surprising, and above all, insanely brave.</p>\n    <p>Their music doesn’t sound like anything else and\n    flies in the face of all conventional wisdom concerning popular music. They take absurd chances and yeah, the album has klunkers\n    amid the bangers, but when I got to its end I went back and started at the beginning again. I found myself\n    smiling ear-to-ear over and over. Maybe I’m being a bit over-the-top here, but check them out: \n    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9Q9ge6j_O4&amp;list=RDl9Q9ge6j_O4&amp;start_radio=1">Mother</a> is live.\n    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MovNWuNPXXE&amp;list=RDMovNWuNPXXE&amp;start_radio=1">Cow Song</a> is off the new\n    album and strong albeit with forgettable video.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">Life online</h2>\n    <p>Every Long Links has hardcore-geek threads and there is no harder core imaginable than Filippo Valsordi’s\n    <a href="https://words.filippo.io/assembly-mutation/">Go Assembly Mutation Testing</a>.

I’m talking about Universal Basic Income or suchlike.

But increasingly, using Google apps feels like being in enemy territory. And, as I said last time, I\n    will not be sorry to shake the dust of Google Drive and Docs from my heels, I find them clumsy and am \n    always having trouble finding something that I know is in there.</p>\n    <p>While I haven’t dug in seriously yet, I keep hearing reasonably-positive things about Proton, and nothing substantive to\n    scare me away.  Wish us luck.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-17">Data sharing (progress!)</h2>\n    <p>Dropbox is, eh, OK. It doesn’t seem actively evil, there’s no advertising, and the price is low.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-21">Photos</h2>\n    <p>We’re a four-Android family including a couple of prolific photographers, and everything just gets pumped into Google and\n    then it fills up and then they want more money.  If we could configure the phones to skip Google and go straight to Dropbox,\n    that would be a step forward.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-16">Video meetings</h2>\n    <p>Google meet isn’t painful but I totally suspect it of data-mining what should be private conversations. I’m getting the\n    feeling that the technical difficulty of videoconferencing is going steadily down, so I’m reasonably optimistic that\n    something a little less evil will come along with a fair price.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-10">Maps</h2>\n    <p>The fear and loathing that \n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/06/29/Fear-Google-Reviews">I started feeling in 2017</a> grows only stronger.  But replacements\n    aren’t obvious.\n    It’s a pity, maps\n    and directions and reviews feel like a natural monopoly that should be a public utility or something, rather than a corporate moat.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Browser (progress!)</h2>\n    <p>Chrome has seriously started making my flesh crawl; once again, enemy territory. Fortunately, there are lots of good options.\n    Even people like us who have multiple lives we need to keep separate can find enough better browsers out there.</p>\n    <p>Maybe I’ll have a look at one of the new genAI-company browsers ha ha just kidding.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-12">Search</h2>\n    <p>The reports on Kagi keep being positive and giving it a try is definitely on the To-Do list.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">Chat</h2>\n    <p>Signal is the only sane choice at this point in history for personal use.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Photo editing</h2>\n    <p>Adobe’s products are good, and I’m proficient and happy with Lightroom, but they are definitely suffering from bad genAI\n    craziness. Also the price is becoming unreasonable.</p>\n    <p>I’ve had a few Lightroom software failures in recent months and if that\n    becomes a trend, looking seriously at the alternatives will move to the top of the priority list.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">In-car interface</h2>\n    <p>It’s tough, Android Auto is a truly great product. I think I’m stuck here for now, particularly given that I plan to be\n    driving a <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/The%20World/Jaguar%20Diary/">2019-model-year car</a> for the foreseeable future. Also, it\n    supports my music apps.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-9">Discover music and play mine (progress!)</h2>\n    <p>Progress here. I’ve almost completely stopped using YouTube Music in favor of Plex and Qobuz. Really no downside; YTM has\n    more or less completely lost the ability to suggest good new stuff.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-13">TV</h2>\n    <p>Video continues morphing itself into Cable TV redux. We have an old Roku box that works fine and I think I’ve managed to find\n    its don’t-spy-on-us settings. We’ll keep subscribing to Apple+ as long as they keep shipping great shows.  I have zero regrets\n    about having\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/03/06/Canceled-Prime">left Prime behind</a>.</p>\n    <p>As for the rest, we’ve become migrants,\n    exclusively month-at-a-time subscriptions for the purpose of watching some serial or sports league, unsubscribe after the season\n    finale or championship game.

This ramble doesn’t exactly have a smooth story arc but I’m\n    posting it anyhow because I know there are people\n    out there interested in state-machine engineering and they are my people.</p>\n    <p>As far as I can tell, a couple of the problems I’m trying to solve\n    haven’t been addressed before, at least not by anyone who published their findings.\n    Partly because of that, I’m starting to wonder if all\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/Technology/Quamina%20Diary/">these disorderly Quamina postings</a> might\n    be worked into a small book or monograph or something. State machines are really freaking useful software constructs!\n    So yeah, this is a war story not an essay, but if you like finite automata you’ll likely be interested in bits of it.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-1">The story thus far</h2>\n    <p>Prior to beginning work on Regular Expressions, I’d already wired shell-style “<code>*</code>” wildcards into Quamina, which\n    forced me to start working with NFAs and ε-transitions. The implementation wasn’t crushingly difficult, and\n    the performance was… OK-ish.</p>\n    <p>Which leads me to The Benchmark From Hell.\n    I wondered how the wildcard functionality would work under heavy stress, so I pulled in a list of 12,959 five-letter strings\n    from the Wordle source code, and inserted a “<code>*</code>” at a random position in each. Here are the first ten:</p>\n    <blockquote><pre><code>aalii*\n*aargh\naar*ti\nabaca*\na*baci\na*back\nab*acs\nab*aft\nabak*a</code></pre></blockquote>\n    <p>I created an NFA for each and merged them together\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/07/28/Union-of-Finite-Automata">as described here</a>. Building and merging the automata were\n    plenty fast enough, and the merged NFA had 46,424 states, which felt reasonable.\n    Matching strings against it ran at under ten thousand per second, which is pretty poor given that Quamina can do a million or\n    two per second on patterns encoded in a DFA.</p>\n    <p>But, I thought, still reasonably usable.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">The cursed “<code>?</code>”</h2>\n    <p>Last year, my\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/12/12/Quamina-Regular-Expression-Series">slow grind through the regexp features</a> had led me\n    to the zero-or-one quantifier “<code>?</code>”.  The state machine for these things is not rocket science; there’s a discussion\n    with pictures in my recent\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Epsilon-Wrangling#p-3">Epsilon Wrangling</a>.</p>\n    <p>So I implemented that and fired off the unit tests, most of which\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/12/12/QRS-Parsing-Regular-Expressions#p-1">I didn’t have to write</a>, and they all failed.\n    Not a surprise I guess.</p>\n    <p>It turned out that the way I’d implemented ε-transitions for the wildcards\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/07/28/Union-of-Finite-Automata#p-9">was partially wrong</a>, as in it worked for the tight-loop\n    state-to-itself ε-transitions, but not for more general-purpose things like “<code>?</code>” requires.</p>\n    <p>In fact, it turns out that merging NFAs is hard (DFAs are easy), and I found precious little help online.\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson%27s_construction">Thompson’s construction</a> does give an answer: Make an\n    otherwise-empty state with two ε-transitions, one to each of the automata, and it’ll do the right thing. Let’s call that\n    a “splice state”. It’s easy to implement, so I did. Splicing is hardly “merging” in the Quamina sense, but still.</p>\n    <p>Unfortunately, the performance was hideously bad, just a few matches per second while pegging the CPU.\n    A glance at the final NFA was sobering; endless chains of splice states, some thousands long.</p>\n    <p>At this point\n    I became very unhappy and got stalled for months dealing with real-life issues while this problem lurked at the back\n    of my mind, growling for attention occasionally.</p>\n    <p>Eventually I let the growler out of the cave and started to think through approaches. But first…</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Worth solving?</h2>\n    <p>Is it, really? What sane person is going to want to search for the union of thousands of regular expressions in general or\n    wild-carded strings in particular?</p>\n    <p>I didn’t think about this problem at all, because of my experience with Quamina’s parent,\n    <a href="https://github.com/aws/event-ruler">Ruler</a>. When it became popular among several AWS and Amazon teams, people\n    sometimes found it useful to match the union of not just thousands but a million or more different patterns. When you write\n    software that anyone actually uses, don’t expect the people using it to share your opinions on what is and isn’t\n    reasonable. So I wasn’t going to get any mental peace until I cracked this nut.</p>\n    <p>I eventually decided that three approaches were worth trying:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Figure out a way really to merge, not just splice, the wildcarded patterns, to produce a simpler automaton.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Optimize the NFA-traversal code path.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Any NFA can be transformed into a DFA, says computer-science theory. So do that, because Quamina is really fast at\n      DFA-based matching.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <h2 id="p-5">Nfa2Dfa</h2>\n    <p>I ended up doing all of these things and haven’t entirely given up on any of them.\n    The most intellectually-elegant was the transform-to-DFA approach, because if I did that, I could remove the fairly-complex\n    NFA-traversal logic from Quamina.</p>\n    <p>It turns out that the Net is rich with textbook extracts and YouTubes and slide-shows about how to do the NFA-to-DFA\n    conversion. It ended up being quite a pleasing little chunk of code, only a couple hundred lines.</p>\n    <p>The bad news: Converting each individual wildcard NFA to a DFA was amazingly fast, but then as I merged them in one by one,\n    the number of automaton states started increasing explosively and the process slowed down so much that I never had the patience\n    to let it finish. Finite-automata theory warns that this can happen, but it’s hard to characterize the cases where it does.\n    I guess this one of them.</p>\n    <p>Having said that, I haven’t discarded the <code>nfa2Dfa</code> code, because perhaps I ought to offer a Quamina option to\n    apply this if you have some collection of patterns that you want to run really super fast and are willing to wait for a while\n    for the transformation process to complete. Also, I may have missed opportunities to optimize the conversion; maybe it’s making\n    more states than it needs to?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Faster NFA traversal</h2>\n    <p>Recently in\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Epsilon-Wrangling">Epsilon wrangling</a> I described how NFA traversal has to work,\n    relying heavily on implementing a thing called an ε-closure.</p>\n    <p>So I profiled the traversal process and discovered, unsurprisingly, that most of the time was going into memory allocation\n    while computing those ε-closures. So now Quamina has an ε-closure cache and will only compute each one once.</p>\n    <p>This helped a lot but not nearly enough, and the profiler was still telling me the pain was in Go’s allocation and\n    garbage-collection machinery. Whittling away at this kind of stuff is not rocket science. The standard Go trick I’ve seen over\n    and over is to keep all your data in slices, keep re-using them then chopping them back to <code>[:0]</code>\n    for each request.  After a while they’ll have grown to the\n    point where all the operations are just copying bytes around, no allocation required.</p>\n    <p>Which also helped, but the speed wasn’t close to what I wanted.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">Merging wildcard automata</h2>\n    <p>I coded multiple ways to do this, and they kept failing. But I eventually found a way to build those\n    automata so that any two of them, or any one of them and a DFA, can merged and generate dramatically\n    fewer ε-transition chains.  I’m not going to write this up here for two reasons: First of all, it’s not <em>that</em>\n    interesting, and second, I worry that I may have to change the approach further as I go on implementing new regxp operators.</p>\n    <p>In particular, at one point I was looking at the code while it wasn’t working, and I could see that if I added a particular\n    conditional it would work, but I couldn’t think of a principled reason to do it. Obviously I’ll have to sort this out\n    eventually. In the meantime, if you’re the sort of um special person who is now burning with curiosity, check out my branch from\n    that PR and have a look at the <code>spinout</code> type.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, I added that conditional even though it puzzled me a bit, and now you can add wildcard patterns to Quamina at 80K/second,\n    and my 12.9K wildcards generate an NFA with with almost 70K states, which can scan events at almost 400K/second. And that’s good\n    enough to ship the <code>“?”</code> feature.</p>\n    <p>By the way, I tried feeding that 70K-state automaton to the DFA converter, and gave up after it’d burned an hour of CPU and\n    grown to occupy many GB of RAM.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">Next steps</h2>\n    <p>Add “<code>+</code>” and “<code>*</code>”, and really hope I don’t have to redesign the NFA machinery again.</p>\n    <p>Also, figure out the explanation for that puzzling <code>if</code> statement.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-9">And I should say…</h2>\n    <p>Despite the very narrow not to say obsessive focus of this series, I’ve gotten a few bits and pieces of positive feedback. So\n    there are a few people out there who care about this stuff. To all of you, thanks.</p>'}]}

Everyone knows that Saskatchewan is flat and brown and empty, right?</p>\n    <img alt="Flowers, intensely colored in near-black purple and yellow" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/TXT55665.png" />\n    <img alt="Trees and lawns, behind a still body of water and somewhat reflected in it" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/TXT55710.png" />\n    <p>Mom lives in\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina,_Saskatchewan">Regina</a>, the provincial capital, a city built round a huge\n    park that contains the Legislature (the flowers are from its front lawn), a sizeable lake, and an artificial\n    mini-mountain (the water and trees are from its tip).\n    Have no fear, I’ll get to some no-kidding prairie landscapes.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-1">Health-care drama</h2>\n    <p>The night I arrived, after my Mom went to bed she got up again, tripped on something and fell hard. Her right arm was\n    swollen, bruised, and painful. The skin and adjacent blood vessels of very old people become thin and fragile; her whole\n    forearm was a bruise. I tried to get her to go to Emergency but she wasn’t having any of it: “You wait for hours and then they\n    give you a pain-killer, which is constipating.”  Since she could twist her wrist and wiggle her fingers and give my hand a firm\n    grasp, I didn’t push too hard.</p>\n    <p>A couple days later on Saturday she got her regular twice-a-week visit from the public\n    <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/health/accessing-health-care-services/care-at-home-and-outside-the-hospital/home-care">HomeCare</a>\n    nurse, a friendly and highly competent Nigerian immigrant, to check her meds and\n    general condition.\n    She looked at Mom’s wrist and said “Get her an appointment with her doctor, they’ll probably want an X-Ray.”</p>\n    <p>I called up her doctor at opening time Monday. The guy who answered the phone said\n    “Don’t have any appointments for a couple weeks but come on over, we’ll squeeze her in.” So we went in after morning coffee and\n    waited less than an hour.\n    The doctor looked at her arm for 45 seconds and said “I’m writing a prescription for an X-Ray” and there was a\n    radiologist around the corner and she was in ten minutes later. The doctor called me back that afternoon and said “Your\n    mother’s got a broken wrist, I got her an 8AM appointment tomorrow at Regina General’s Cast Clinic.”</p>\n    <p>The doctor at the clinic looked at her wrist for another 45 seconds and said “Yeah, put on a cast” so they did and we were\n    home by ten. I’d pessimistically overpaid a couple bucks for hospital parking.</p>\n    <p>The reason I’m including this is because I notice that this space has plenty of American readers. Did you notice that the\n    story entirely omits insurance companies and money (except parking)? In Canada your health-care comes with your taxes (granted,\n    higher than Americans’) and while the system is far from perfect, it can fix up an old lady’s broken wrist pretty damn fucking\n    quick without any bureaucratic bullshit. Also, Canada spends a huge amount less per head on health-care than the US does.</p>\n    <p>And Mom told me not to forget that Saskatchewan is the birthplace of Canadian single-payer universal healthcare.\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Douglas">Tommy Douglas</a>, the Social Democrat who made that happen, has been\n    named\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_Canadian">The Greatest Canadian</a>.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Gentle surface</h2>\n    <p>Oh, did I say “flat and brown and empty”? Wrong, wrong, and wrong. The Prairies, in Canada and the US too, have textures and\n    colors and hills and valleys, it’s just that the slopes are gentle.  There are really flat parts and they make farmers’ lives easier, but\n    more or less every square inch that’s not a town or a park is farmed.\n    I took Mom for a drive out in the country southeast of Regina, from whence these views:</p>\n    <img alt="A road leading slightly uphill, brilliant yellow canola on both sides" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/TXT55698.png" />\n    <img alt="Yellow canola flowers under a blue sky" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/TXT55700.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>Note that in both shots we’re looking up a gentle slope. In the second, there’s farm infrastructure on\n    the distant horizon.<br />Also consider the color of the sky.</p></div>\n    <p>In Canada that yellow-flowering crop is called “Canola”, which Wikipedia claims refers to a particular cultivar of \n    <i>Brassica napus</i>, commonly known as rapeseed or just rape, so you can see why when Canada’s\n    agribiz sector wanted to position its oil as the thing to use while cooking they went for the cultivar not the species\n    name. I’m old enough to remember when farmers still said just “rapeseed”. Hmm, Wikipedia also claims that the OED claims this:\n    The term “rape” derives from the Latin word for turnip, <i>rāpa</i> or <i>rāpum</i>, cognate with the Greek word ῥάφη,\n    <i>rhaphe</i>.</p>\n    <p>Let’s stick with canola.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Pixelated color</h2>\n    <p>After I’d taken those two canola-field shots I pulled out my Pixel and took another, but I’m not gonna share it because the\n    Pixel decided to turn the sky from what I thought was a complex and interesting hue into its opinion of “what a blue sky looks\n    like” only this sky didn’t.</p>\n    <p>Maybe it’s just me, but I think Google’s camera app is becoming increasingly opinionated about color, and not in a good\n    way. There are plenty of alternative camera apps, I should check them out.</p>\n    <p>In case it’s not obvious, I love photographing Saskatchewan and think it generally looks pretty great, especially when you\n    look up. On the province’s license plates it says “Land of living skies”, and no kidding.</p> \n    <img alt="Saskatchewan’s living skies" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250704_032320050.png" />\n    <img alt="Saskatchewan’s living skies" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/PXL_20250704_032334240.png" />\n    <img alt="Saskatchewan’s living skies" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/09/TXT55717.png" />\n    <div class="caption"><p>The first two are from the park behind Mom’s place,<br />the third from that mini-mountain mentioned\n    above.</p></div>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Experience and memory</h2>\n    <p>My Mom’s doing well for a nonagenerian. She’s smart. When I visited early last fall and we talked about the US election I was\n    bullish on Kamala Harris’s chances. She laughed at me and said “The Americans won’t elect a woman.” Well then.</p>\n    <p>But she’s forgetful in the short term. I took her to the Legislature’s\n    garden and to the top of the mini-mountain and for a drive out in the country and another adventure we’ll get to; she\n    enjoyed them all. But maybe she won’t remember them.</p>\n    <p>“Make memories” they say, but what if you show someone you love a good time and maybe they won’t remember it the\n    next day? I’m gonna say it’s still worthwhile and has a lesson to teach about what matters. There endeth the lesson.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">The gallery</h2>\n    <p>Indigenous people make up 17% of Regina’s population, the highest share in any significant Canadian city. By “indigenous” I\n    mean the people that my ancestors stole the land from.

A commenter pointed out that the definition of “epsilon”\n    in that piece is not quite right per standard finite-automata theory, but it’s still a useful in that it describes how\n    epsilons support constructs like the shell-style “<code>*</code>”.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Background</h2>\n    <p>Finite automata come in two flavors: Deterministic (DFA) and Nondeterministic (NFA).  DFAs move from state to state one input\n    symbol at a time: it’s simple and easy to understand and to implement.\n    NFAs have two distinguishing characteristics: First, when you’re in a\n    state and an input symbol arrives, you can transfer to more than one other state. Second, a state can have “epsilon transitions”\n    (let’s say “ε” for epsilon), which can happen any time at all while you’re in that state, input or no input.</p>\n    <p>NFAs are more complicated to traverse (will discuss below) but you need them if you want to\n    implement regular expressions with <code>.</code> and <code>?</code> and <code>*</code> and so on. You can turn any NFA into a\n    DFA, and I’ll come back to that subject in a future piece.</p>\n    <p>For implementing NFAs, I’ve been using\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson%27s_construction">Thompson\'s construction</a>, where\n    “Thompson” is\n    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>, co-parent of Unix. This technique is also nicely\n    described by Russ Cox in \n    <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast</a>. You don’t need to\n    learn it to understand this piece, but I’ll justify design\n    choices by saying “per Thompson”.</p>\n    <p>I’m going to discuss two specific issues today, ε-closures and a simpler NFA definition.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">ε-closures</h2>\n    <p>To set the stage, consider this regexp: <code>A?B?C?X</code></p>\n    <p>It should match “X” and “BX” and “ACX” and so on, but not “CAX” or “XX”.\n    Thompson says that you implement <code>A?</code> with a\n    transition to the next state on “A” and another ε-transition to that next state; because if you see an “A” you should transition,\n    but then you can transition anyhow even if you don’t.</p>\n    <p>The resulting NFA looks like this:</p>\n    <img alt="NFA matching A?B?C?X" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/AcmBcmCcmX.png" />\n    <p> In finite-automaton\n    math, states are usually represented by the letter “q” followed by a number (usually italicized and subscripted, like\n    <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>, but not here, sorry). Note <code>q4</code>’s double circle which means it’s\n    a goal state, i.e. if we get here we’ve matched the regexp.\n    I should add that this was produced with\n    <a href="https://draw.io">draw.io</a>, which seems to make this sort of thing easy.\n    </p>\n    <h2 id="p-5">Back to that NFA</h2>\n    <p>So, here’s a challenge: Sketch out the traversal code in your head. Think about the input strings “AX” and “BCX” and just “X”\n    and how you’d get through the NFA to the Q4 goal state.</p>\n    <p>The trick is what’s called the ε-closure. When you get to a state, before you look at the next input symbol, you have to set\n    up to process it. In this case, you need to be able to transition on an A or B or C. So what you do is pull together the\n    start state <code>q0</code> and also any other states you can reach from there through ε-transitions. In this case, the ε-closure\n    for the start state is <code>{q0,\xa0q1,\xa0q2,\xa0q3}</code>.</p>\n    <p>Suppose, then, that you see a “B” input symbol. You apply it to all the states in the ε-closure. Only <code>q1</code> matches,\n    transitioning you to\n    <code>q2</code>. Before you look at the next input symbol, you compute the ε-closure for <code>q2</code>, which turns\n    out to be <code>{q2,\xa0q3}</code>. With this ε-closure, you can match “C” or “X”. If you get a “C”, you”ll step to\n    <code>q3</code>, whose ε-closure is just itself, because “X” is the only path forward.</p>\n    <p>So your NFA-traversal algorithm for one step becomes something like:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Start with a list of states.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Compute the ε-closure of that list.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Read an input symbol.</p></li>\n      <li><p>For each state in the ε-closure, see if you can traverse to another state.</p></li>\n      <li><p>If so, add it to your output list of states.</p></li>\n      <li><p>When you’re done, your output list of states is the input to this algorithm for the next step.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Computation issues</h2>\n    <p>Suppose your regular expression is <code>(A+BC?)+</code>. I’m not going to sketch out the NFA, but just looking at it tells\n    you that it has to have loopbacks; once you’ve matched the parenthetized chunk you need to go back to a state where you can\n    recognize another occurrence.\n    For this regexp’s NFA, computing the ε-closures can lead you into an infinite loop. (Should be obvious, but I didn’t realize it until\n    after the first time it happened.)</p>\n    <p>You can have loops and you can also have dupes. In practice, it’s not that uncommon for a state to have more than one\n    ε-transition, and for the targets of these transitions to overlap.</p>\n    <p>So you need to watch for loops and to dedupe your output. I think the only way to avoid this is with a cookie-crumbs\n    “where I’ve been” trail, either as a list or a hash table.</p> \n    <p>Both of these are problematic because they require allocating memory, and that’s something you really don’t want to do when\n    you’re trying to match patterns to events at Quamina’s historic rate of millions per second.</p>\n    <p>I’ll dig into this problem in a future Quamina-Diary outing, but obviously, caching computed\n    epsilon closures would avoid re-doing this computation.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, bear ε-closures in mind, because they’ll keep coming up as this series goes on.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">And finally, simplifying “NFA”</h2>\n    <p>At the top of this piece, I offered the standard definition of NFAs: First, when you’re in a\n    state and an input symbol arrives, you can transfer to more than one other state. Second, you can have ε-transitions.\n    Based on my recent work, I think this definition is redundant. Because if you need to transfer to two different states on some\n    input symbol, you can do that with ε-transitions.</p>\n    <p>Here’s a mini-NFA that transfers from state <code>q0</code> on “A” to both <code>q1</code> and <code>q2</code>.</p>\n    <img alt="An NFA transferring to two different states on an input symbol" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Splice-1.png" />\n    <p>And here’s how you can achieve the same effect with ε-transitions:</p>\n    <img alt="Transferring to two destinations using ε-transitions" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/07/Splice-2.png" />\n    <p>In that NFA, in <code>qS</code> the “S” stands for “splice”, because it’s a state that exists to connect\n    two threads of finite-automaton traversal.</p>\n    <p>I’m pretty sure that this is more than just a mathematical equivalence. In my regexp implementation, so far at least,\n    I’ve never encountered a need to do that first kind of dual transition. Furthermore, the “splice” structure is how Thompson\n    implements the regular-expression “<code>|</code>” operator.</p>\n    <p>So if you’re building an NFA, all the traversal stuff you need in a state is a simple map from input symbol to next state,\n    and a list of ε-transitions.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">Next up</h2>\n    <p>How my own implementation of NFA traversal collided head-on into the Benchmark From Hell and still hasn’t recovered.</p>'}]}

They’re doing this for exactly one\n    reason: They think they can discard armies of employees and replace them with LLM services, at the cost of\n    shipping shittier products.  Do you think your management would spend that kind of money to help you with a quicker first draft or\n    a summarized inbox?</p>\n    <p>Adobe said the quiet part out loud:\n    <a href="https://petapixel.com/2024/05/03/adobe-throws-photographers-under-the-bus-again-skip-the-photoshoot/">Skip the\n    Photoshoot</a>. </p>\n    <p>At this point someone will point out that previous technology waves have generated as much employment as they’ve eliminated.\n    Maybe so, but that’s not what business leaders think they’re buying. They think they’re buying smaller payrolls.</p>\n    <p>Maybe I’m overly sensitive, but thinking about these truths leads to a mental stench that makes me want to stay away from\n    it.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">How much does genAI cost?</h2>\n    <p>Well, I already mentioned all those hundreds of billions. But that’s pocket change. The investment community in general and\n    Venture Capital in particular will whine and moan, but the people who are losing the money are people who can afford to.</p>\n    <p>The first real cost is hypothetical: What if those business leaders are correct and they can gleefully dispose of millions of\n    employees? If you think we’re already suffering from egregious levels of inequality, what happens when a big chunk of the\n    middle class suddenly becomes professionally superfluous?  I’m no economist so I’ll stop there, but you don’t have to be a\n    rocket scientist to predict severe economic pain.</p>\n    <p>Then there’s the other thing that nobody talks about, the massive greenhouse-gas load that all those data centers are going\n    to be pumping out. This at a time when we we blow past one atmospheric-carbon metric after another and David Suzuki says\n    <a href="https://www.ipolitics.ca/2025/07/02/its-too-late-david-suzuki-says-the-fight-against-climate-change-is-lost/">the\n    fight against climate change is lost</a>, that we need to hunker down and work on survival at the local level.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">The real problem</h2>\n    <p>It’s the people who are pushing it.  Their business goals are quite likely, as a side-effect, to make\n    the world a worse place, and they don’t give a fuck.  Their technology will inevitably worsen the onrushing climate catastrophe,\n    and they don’t give a fuck.</p>\n    <p>It’s probably not as simple as “They’re just shitty people”<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009it’s not exactly easy to escape the\n    exigencies of modern capitalism.

Third?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">Enter Claude</h2>\n    <p>So I prompted Claude thus:</p>\n    <blockquote><p>I need Go code to provide a "intern"-like function for lists of pointers. For example, if I have several\n    different []*int arrays, which may contain duplicates, I want to call intern() on each of them and get back a single canonical\n    pointer which is de-duplicated and thus a set.</p></blockquote>\n    <p>Claude did pretty well. It got the algorithm right, the code was idiomatic and usefully commented, and it also provided a\n    decent unit test (but in a <code>main()</code> stanza rather than a proper Go test file).\n    I didn’t try actually running it.</p>\n    <p>The interesting part was the key computation. I, being lazy, had just done a Go <code>fmt.Sprintf("%p")</code>\n    incantation to get a hex string representing each state’s address, sorted them, joined them, and that was the key.</p>\n    <p>Claude worked with the pointers more directly.</p>\n    <pre><code>\t// Sort by pointer address for consistent ordering\n\tsort.Slice(unique, func(i, j int) bool {\n\t\treturn uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(unique[i])) &lt; uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(unique[j]))\n\t})</code></pre>\n    <p>Then it concatenated the raw bytes of the map addresses and lied to Go by claiming it was a string.</p>\n    <pre><code>\t// Create key from pointer addresses\n\tkey := make([]byte, 0, len(slice)*8)\n\tfor _, ptr := range slice {\n\t\taddr := uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(ptr))\n\t\t// Convert address to bytes\n\t\tfor i := 0; i &lt; 8; i++ {\n\t\t\tkey = append(key, byte(addr&gt;&gt;(i*8)))\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn string(key)</code></pre>\n\t<p>This is an improvement in that the keys will be half the size of my string version.\n\tI didn’t copy-paste Claude’s code wholesale, just replaced ten or so lines of key construction.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">Take-away</h2>\n    <p>I dunno. I thought the quality of the code was fine, wouldn’t have decomposed the functions in the same way but wouldn’t have\n    objected on review. I was pleased with the algorithm, but then I would be since it was the same one I’d written, and, having\n    said that, quite possibly that’s the only algorithm that anyone has used. It will be <em>super</em> interesting if someone\n    responds to this write-up saying “You and Claude are fools, here’s a much better way.”</p>\n    <p>Was it worth fifteen minutes of my time to ask Claude and get a slightly better key computation?\n    Only if this ever turns out\n    to be a hot code path and I don’t think anybody’s smart enough to know that in advance.</p>\n    <p>Would I have saved time by asking Claude first? Tough to tell; Quamina’s data structures are a bit non-obvious and I would\n    have had to go to a lot of prompting work to get it to emit code I could use directly.\n    Also, since Quamina is low-level performance-critical infrastructure code, I’d be nervous about having any volume of code\n    that I didn’t really <em>really</em> understand.</p>\n    <p>I guess my take-away was that in this case, Claude knew the Go idioms and APIs better than I did; I’d never looked at the\n    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/unsafe">unsafe</a> package.</p>\n    <p>Which reinforces my\n    suspicion that genAI is going to be especially useful at helping generate code to talk to big complicated\n    APIs that are hard to remember all of.  Here’s an example: Any moderately competent Android developer could add a feature to an\n    app where it strobes the flash and surges the vibration in sync with how fast you’re shaking the device back and forth,\n    probably in an afternoon. But it would require a couple of dozen calls into the dense forest of Android APIs, and I suspect a\n    genAI might get you there a lot faster by just filling the calls in as prompted.</p>\n    <p>Reminder: This is just anecdata.</p>'}]}

To get a feel, check out\n      <a href="https://www.qobuz.com/ca-en/magazine">Qobuz Magazine</a>; you don’t have to be a subscriber.</p></li>\n      <li><p>It gives evidence of being built by people who love music.</p></li>\n      <li><p>They’re obsessive about sound quality, which is great, but only makes a difference if you’re listening through quality\n      speakers.</p></li>\n      <li><p>A few weeks ago, the mobile app quality switched from adequate to\n      excellent.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <h2 id="p-2">That app</h2>\n    <p>I want to side-trip a bit here, starting with a question. How long has it been since an app you use has added a feature that\n    was genuinely excellent and let you do stuff you couldn’t before and didn’t get in your way and created no suspicion that it was\n    strip-mining your life for profit?  I’m here to tell you that this can still happen, and it’s a crushing criticism\n    of my profession that it so rarely does.</p>\n    <p>I’m talking about\n    <a href="https://www.qobuz.com/ca-en/connect">Qobuz Connect</a>. I believe there are other music apps that can do this sort of\n    stuff, but it feels like magic to me.</p>\n    <p>It’s like this. I listen to music at home on an audiophile system with big speakers, in\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/The%20World/Jaguar%20Diary/">our car</a>, and on\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/08/06/Jeanneau-795">our boat</a>.  The only app I touch is the\n    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qobuz.music">Qobuz Android app</a>. The only time it’s actually\n    receiving and playing the music itself is in the car, with the help of Android Auto.  In the other scenarios it’s talking to\n    Qobuz running on a Mac, which actually fetches the music and routes it to the audio system.\n    Usually it figures out what player I want it to control automatically, although there’ve been a couple\n    times when I drove away in the car and it got confused about where to send the music. Generally, it works great.</p>\n    <p>The app’s music experience is rich and involving.</p>\n    <img alt="Qobuz Android app screenshot" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/22/Screenshot_20250622-230116.png" />\n    <p>It has New Releases and curated playlists and a personalized stream for\n    me and a competent search function for those times I absolutely must listen to Deep Purple or Hania Rani or\n    whoever.</p>\n    <p>I get a chatty not-too-long email from Qobuz every Friday, plugging a few of the week’s new releases, with sideways and\n    backward looks too. (This week: A Brian Wilson stream.) The app has so much stuff, especially among the themed streams, that I\n    sometimes get lost. But somehow it’s not irritating; what’s on the screen remains musically interesting and you can always hit\n    the app’s Home button.</p>\n    <p>Qobuz has its own musical tastes that guide its curation. They’re not always compatible with\n    mine<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009my tolerance for EDM and mainstream Hip-hop remains low. And I wish they were\n    stronger on Americana. But the intersection is broad enough to provide plenty of enjoyable new-artist experiences. Let me share\n    one with you:\n    <a href="https://kwashibu.bandcamp.com/album/love-warrior-s-anthem">Kwashibu Area Band</a>, from Ghana.</p>\n    <p>Oh, one complaint: Qobuz was eating my Pixel’s battery. So I poked around online and it’s a known problem; you have to use the\n    Android preferences to stop it from running in the background. Huh? What was it doing in the background anyhow?! But it seems to\n    work fine even when it’s not doing it.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">A Mac, you say?</h2>\n    <p>The music you’re listening to is going to be stored on disk, or incoming from a streaming service. Maybe you want to serve\n    some of the stored music out to listen to it in the car or wherever. There are a variety of audio products in the\n    “Streamer” category that do some of these things in various combinations. A lot of them make fanciful claims about the\n    technology inside and are thus expensive, you can easily spend thousands.</p>\n    <p>But any reasonably modern computer can do all these things and more, plus it also can drive a big-screen display, plus it will\n    probably run the software behind whatever next year’s New Audio Hotness is.</p>\n    <p>At this point the harder-core geeks will adopt a superior tone of voice to say “I do all that stuff with FreeBSD and a bunch of\n    open-source packages running on a potato!”</p>\n    <p>More power to ’em. But I recommend a basic Apple Silicon based Mac Mini, M1 is fine, which you can get for like $300 used on\n    eBay. And if you own a lot of music and video you can plug in a 5T USB drive for a few more peanuts. This will run Plex and\n    Qobuz and almost any other imaginable streaming software. Plus you can plug it into your home-theater screen and it has a modern\n    Web browser so you can also play anything from anywhere on the Web.</p>\n    <p>I’ve been doing this for a while but I had one big gripe. When I wanted to stream music from the Mac, I needed to use a\n    keyboard and mouse, so I keep one of each, Bluetooth-flavored, nearby. But since I got Qobuz running that’s become a very rare\n    occurrence.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">You’re forgetting something</h2>\n    <p>Oh, and yeah, there’s the record player. Playing it requires essentially no software at all, isn’t that great?</p>'}]}

South Korea, of course, being the canonical example. But also Japan and Taiwan and Italy and Spain\n    and so on.</p>\n    <p>And, of course, the USA, where the numbers aren’t <em>that</em> much higher:\n    <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/fertility-rate">U.S. Fertility Rate\n    (1950-2025)</a>. Even so, the population still grows (because of immigration), albeit at less than 1% per annum:\n    <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/population-growth-rate">U.S. Population Growth\n    Rate</a>. If the MAGAs get their way and eventually stop all non-white immigration, the US will be in South Korea\n    territory within a generation or two. </p>    \n    <p>A reasonable person might ask why. It’s not really complicated, as you can read here:\n    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/15/opinion/birth-rate-parenting-natalism.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Pk8.OBam.dOi0UpP-8-DV&amp;smid=url-share">A Bold Idea to Raise the Birthrate: Make Parenting Less Torturous</a>.\n    From which I quote: “To date, no government policies have significantly improved their nation’s birthrates for a sustained\n    period.” The essay argues convincingly that it’s down to two problems: Capitalism and sexism.

To\n    summarize the conversation: A few people, not obviously fools,  are saying “This stuff seems to help me” and many others, also\n    apparently sensible, are shouting back “You’re lying to yourself, it can’t be helping!”  Here is some of the testimony: \n    Kellan on <a href="https://laughingmeme.org//2025/05/25/vibe-coding-for-teams.html">Vibe\n    coding for teams, thoughts to date</a>, Armin Ronacher on\n    <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/12/agentic-coding/">Agentic Coding Recommendations</a>,\n    Harper on <a href="https://harper.blog/2025/05/08/basic-claude-code/">Basic Claude Code</a>, and \n    Klabnik on \n    <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/a-tale-of-two-claudes/">A tale of two Claudes</a></p>\n    <p>I lean to believing narratives of personal experience, but on the other hand the skeptics make good points. Another\n    random piece of evidence: Because I’m lazy, I tend to resist adopting technologies that have steep learning curves, which genAI\n    currently does. On many occasions, this has worked out well because those technologies have turned out not to pay off very\n    well. Am I a canary in the coal mine?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">*cough*</h2>\n    <p>Since I introduced myself into the narrative, I’ll note that today is my 70th birthday.

The ΛCDM-vs-MOND controversy, i.e. “Is there really dark\n    matter or does gravity get weird starting at the outer edges of galaxies?”, offers great entertainment value. And, there is\n    news!</p>\n    <p>First of all, here’s a nice overview on the controversy:\n    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21638v1">Modified Newtonian Dynamics: Observational Successes and Failures</a>.</p>\n    <p>Which points out that the behavior of “wide binary” star systems ought to help resolve the issue, but that people who\n    study it keep coming up with contradictory findings. Here’s the latest, from Korean researchers: Press release\n    <a href="http://www.sejongpr.ac.kr/sejongnewspaperview.do?currentPage=1&amp;searchField=&amp;searchValue=&amp;boardType=3&amp;pkid=73549&amp;utm_source=beehiiv&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=mediamobilize&amp;_bhlid=3e40dce99e536f4015a1dd2c6afd193a465d17ea">New method of measuring gravity with 3D velocities of wide binary stars is developed and confirms modified gravity</a>\n    and peer-reviewed paper:\n    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adce09">Low-acceleration Gravitational Anomaly\n    from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia Data Release 3</a>.\n    Spoiler: They think the gravity gets weird.

They’re different, in interesting ways. Let’s walk through the\n    second one.</p> \n    <p>The little thumbnail at the top of the popup is what the image looked like when the C2PA was added. Not provided by the other\n    verifier.</p>\n    <p>The paragraph beginning “Displaying credentials…” says that the C2PA manifest was embedded in the JPG as opposed to stored\n    out on the \n    cloud; The cloud works fine, and is perhaps a good idea because the C2PA manifest can be quite large. I’m not clear on what the\n    “watermark” is about.</p>\n    <p>“Issued by Adobe” means that the Chrome extension verified the embedded C2PA against Adobe’s public key and can be\n    confident that yes, this was really signed by them.</p>\n    <p>“<b>Produced by</b> Timothy Bray” is interesting. How can it know? Well, it turns out that it used LinkedIn’s API to verify\n    that I am\n    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timbraysoftwareguy/">timbraysoftwareguy</a> over on LinkedIn. But it goes further; LinkedIn\n    has an integration with\n    <a href="https://www.clearme.com">Clear</a>, the airport-oriented identity provider. To get a Clear account you have to upload\n    government-issued ID, it’s not trivial.</p>\n    <p>So this short sentence expands to (take a deep breath) “The validator extension verified that Adobe said that\n    LinkedIn said that Clear said that the government ID of the person who posted this says that he’s named Timothy Bray.”</p>\n    <p>Note that the first extension’s popup also tells you that Adobe has verified what my LinkedIn and Instagram accounts\n    are. This seems super-useful and I wonder why the other omits it.</p>\n    <p>“<b>App or device used</b>…” is simple enough, but I’m not actually sure how it works; I guess Adobe has embedded a keypair\n    in my Lightroom installation? If I’d taken the picture with a C2PA-equipped camera this is where that history would be\n    displayed.</p>\n    <p>“<b>AI tool used</b> None”. Interesting and useful, since Adobe provides plenty of genAI-powered tools. Of course, this\n    relies on Lightroom telling the truth, but still.</p>\n    <p>The “View More” button doesn’t currently work; it takes you to the interactive\n    <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/verify/">contentcredentials.org/verify</a> page,\n    which seems to fail in retrieving the JPG. If you download the picture then upload it into the verify page (go ahead, it’s\n    free) \n    that seems to work fine. In addition to the info on the popup, the verify page will tell you (nontechically i.e. vaguely) what I\n    did to the picture with Lightroom.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-3">What’s good about this?</h2>\n    <p>Well, it’s here and it works! There’s all this hype about how cool it will be when the C2PA includes info about what model\n    of camera and lens it used and what the shutter speed was and so on, but eh, who cares really? What matters to me (and \n    should matter to the world) is <em>provenance</em>: Who posted this thing?</p>\n    <p>As I write this, supporters of Israel and Iran are\n    <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-ai-slop-fight-between-iran-and-israel/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter">having an AI Slop\n    Fight</a> with fake war photos and videos.\n    In a C2PA-rich world, you could check; If some clip doesn’t have Content Credentials you should\n    probably be suspicious, and if it does, it matters whether it was uploaded by someone at\n    <a href="https://www.idf.il/en/">IDF.il</a> versus\n    <a href="https://www.bbc.com">BBC.co.uk</a>.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-2">What’s wrong with this?</h2>\n    <p>Look, I hate to nitpick. I’m overwhelmingly positive on this news, it’s an existence proof that C2PA can be made to work in\n    the wild.\n    My impression is that most of the money and muscle comes from Adobe; good on ’em.\n    But there are things that would make it more useful, and usable by more Web sites. These are not listed in\n    any particular order.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-7">Identity!</h2>\n    <p>Adobe, it’s nice that you let me establish my identity with LinkedIn, Instagram, and Clear. But what I’d\n    <em>really</em> like is if you could also verify and sign my Fediverse and Bluesky handles. And, Fediverse and ATProto\n    developers, would you please, first of all, stop stripping C2PA manifests from uploaded photo EXIF, and secondly, add your own\n    link to the C2PA chain saying something like “Originally posted by @timbray@cosocial.ca.”</p>\n    <p>Because having verifiable media provenance in the world of social media would be a strong tool against disinformation\n    and slop.</p>\n    <p>Oh, and another note to Adobe: When I export a photo, the embed-manifest also offers me the opportunity, under the heading\n    “Web3”, to allow the image “be used for NFT creative attribution on supported marketplaces” where the supported marketplaces are\n    Phantom and MetaMask. Seriously, folks, in 2025? Please get this scammy cryptoslime out of my face.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-4">Browsers please…</h2>\n    <p>This was done with Chrome extensions. There are people working on extensions for Firefox and\n    Safari, but they’re not here yet. Annoyingly, the extensions also don’t seem to work in mobile Chrome, which is where most\n    people look at most media.</p>\n    <p>I would love it if this were done directly and automatically by the browser.\n    The major browsers aren’t perfect, but their creators are known to take security seriously, and I’d be much happier trusting\n    one of them, rather than an extension from a company I’d never previously heard of.</p>\n    <h2 id="p-8">… or maybe JavaScript?</h2>\n    <p>The next-best solution would be a nice JS package that just Does The Right\n    Thing. It should work like the way I do fonts: If you look in the source for the page you are now reading, the splodge of JS at\n    the top includes a couple of lines \n    that mention “typekit.com”. Typekit (since acquired by Adobe) offers access to a huge selection of excellent fonts.\n    Those JS invocations result in the text you are now reading being displayed in\n    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/07/17/Tisa">FF Tisa Web Pro</a>.</p>\n    <p>Which<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009this is important<span class="dashes">\u2009—</span>\u2009is not free. And to be clear, I am\n    willing to pay to get Content Credentials for the pictures on this blog. It feels exactly like paying a small fee for access to\n    a professionally-managed font library.\n    Operating a Content-Credentials service wouldn’t be free, it’d require running a\n    server and wrangling certs. At scale, though, it should be pretty cheap.</p>\n    <p>So here’s an offer: If someone launches a service that allows me to straightforwardly include the\n    fact that this picture was sourced from tbray.org in my Content Credentials, my wallet is (modestly) open.</p>\n    <p>By the way, the core JavaScript code is already under construction; here’s \n    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/c2pa-extension-validator">Microsoft</a> and the\n    <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/introduction">Content Authority Initiative</a> itself.\n    There’s also a Rust crate for server-side use, and a “c2patool” command-line utility based on it..</p>\n    <h2 id="p-6">Open-Source issues</h2>\n    <p>You’ll notice that the right-click-for-Content-Credentials doesn’t work on the smaller version of the picture embedded in the\n    text you are now reading; just the larger one.  This is because the decades-old Perl-based <span class="o">ongoing</span>\n    publishing software runs the main-page pictures through\n    <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a>, which doesn’t do C2PA. I should find a way to route around this.</p>\n    <p>In fact, it wouldn’t be rocket science for ImageMagick (or open-source packages generally) to write C2PA manifests and insert\n    them in the media files they create.  But how should they sign them? As noted, that requires a server that provides cert-based\n    signatures, something that nobody would expect from even well-maintained open-source packages.</p>\n    <p>I dunno, maybe someone should provide a managed-ImageMagick service that (for a small fee) offers signed-C2PA-manifest\n    embedding?</p>\n    <h2 id="p-9">What’s next?</h2>\n    <p>The work that needs to be done is nontrivial but, frankly, not that taxing. And the rewards would be high.\n    Because it feels like a no-brainer that knowing who posted something is a big deal. Also the inverse: Knowing that you\n    <em>don’t</em> know who posted it.</p>\n    <p>Where is it an especially big deal? On social media, obviously. It’s really time for those guys to start climbing on board.</p>'}]}

I hope you had a most excellent weekend.  Mine was a bit odd.  I spent a good deal of time out in the garage working on reorganizing things.  Right now I am trying to clear the south side so that I can put up shelving there, which will allow me to organize everything that I am moving.  Saturday night however I found out that my folks fridge went out, so I was up there after editing podcasts and got the joy of wrestling the fridge out of where it had sunk down into the linoleum over two decades.  I&#8217;ve reached the point where I am not stronger than my father&#8230; probably always was&#8230;  but it is still just a disappointing realizing how much weaker he has gotten over the last several years.  Not that I am exactly Sampson or anything, and a lot of my strength is largely just me putting my weight behind things and pushing like the dickins. We got it moved out however, and Dad can now go shopping for a replacement.  Thankfully they have a spare fridge, but it is just less convenient.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30108" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251017-072003926.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the gaming world&#8230; I mostly spent the weekend playing Destiny Rising. My progress is starting to slow down a bit because effectively I am in a state where I largely need master/grandmaster activities to move the needle forward. I did get my third and fourth character to gold so I have pushed Jolder, Estela, Helhest, and Umeko through the hoops required to finish the gold medallion.  At this point each one of these that I push up, is mostly just giving me points to spend on a talent tree of buffs on the ascension screen.  These are largely things like buffing the exotic artifact and weapon mod drop rates.  It is the weapon mods that I need the most right now.  They are way trickier than any of the other exotic items because in theory you really want a weapon mod that activates a specific perk on a specific weapon. I put some dead mods into these characters weapons just to push their light up&#8230;  but at some point I need to replace them with fully functional mods.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30100" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251020-065108875.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to participate in Master/GrandMaster level activities you have to get their light up to 64,000 and at this point I have managed to do that with three characters.  The thing is you only get to run one GrandMaster activity once per character, so that means I can spend three keys per week getting significant upgrades.  This past week Ace and I got together and ran them as a duo, and we should probably keep doing that.  I wish we had a third really active player that was compatible with our times&#8230;. that also was as progressed as we are currently.  Given enough time we probably will have.  After doing Grandmaster Gauntlet Blitz&#8230; I would love to have a full team of six players, because it would be super fun to queue in together using proper squad tactics. At some point I might have to declare a &#8220;Destiny Rising&#8221; night, similar to how we have done with Guild Wars 2, but the challenge as always will be finding a night everyone can participate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30104" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251018-153851912.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In other progression news&#8230;  I have continued spending every last drop of free currency that I get on Helhest, and have now pulled four copies of her, giving me 3 talent points.  At this point it isn&#8217;t so much that I am pulling for duplicate copies and thus talent points&#8230; and more that I really want to finish getting the parts to her artwork which unlocks a cool Ghost Shell and Sparrow.  Helhest will just keep getting more and more powerful, the more points I unlock for her however.  All of the points are pretty freaking great to be honest, and as much as like this champion I don&#8217;t really mind that I am effectively negatively impacting the next banner, since I won&#8217;t have a cache of points saved up to spend on it like I did this time where I had 5 10 pulls banked.  I&#8217;ve just had better luck pulling for her than any other banner in the past though.  I&#8217;ve beat pity by a massive amount each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30098" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251020-070826927.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In Pack news, we have ranked up the guild for the third time since we started it.  This feels pretty freaking good considering we only have a handful of active players. I had hoped more folks would jump on this bandwagon, but I think the whole gacha trappings are a bridge too far for a lot of players.  As is evidenced by my free account, you can pretty much get all of the stuff without spending a dime given that account already has every four star, and two of the five stars.  Really that is more than enough goodness to play with and be functional participating in even the highest end content in the game. While I spun up that second account to make creating the guild a bit easier, I am kind of glad that I have it because it gives me a good pulse on what playing the game looks like if you do not spend a dime.  So far the prognosis is extremely solid for someone coming in as a &#8220;zero spender&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30103" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251018-091941848.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing that I have finished is the Wheel of Fortune event that is going on. The weirdest thing about this&#8230; is that I am still collecting spins each day, even though I have nothing to spend them on. I kind of expected there to be some system that allowed me to cash these in for glimmer or something like that, but so far nothing that I can see.  I am actually really close to finishing out this event on my second account as well.  I am not sure what the math works out to be, but it should be pretty simple for anyone to complete this event just by doing dailies each day. Immediately following this is going to be a rerun of the Morgran&#8217;s event, which should in theory guarantee another exotic weapon&#8230; and the wording makes me wonder if it is a guaranteed unlock of one that you have not found before. It is specifically referred to as a &#8220;Precious Reward&#8221; which makes me think it has some custom logic applied to what sort of things it can give you over just a standard Exotic Engram.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30101" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251020-064940343.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we now have the firing range in our guild hall, we get to see one of the features which is a hall of heroes time functionality showing the highest scoring champions from the previous cycle.  We did not do enough of a few of the things to quality, but Ace dusted me and is the only person showing up with their Helhest and Estela on display.  In my wanderer pack guild I was often highlighted, so I have at least gotten to see my own characters in these holos in the past.  At some point Ace just leapt past me in progression, mostly because they are way more focused on doing the right thing with their daily stamina as opposed to me&#8230;  where I sometimes just like spending it on something trivial. I do find it weird why we don&#8217;t have anyone showing up for a few of the modes&#8230;  but it might just be that Calamity Ops for example has a longer than weekly cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30099" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251020-070240912.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To the laundry list of things that I progressed this weekend&#8230; add planetary reputation.  I now have both the Red Sea Rift and Jiangshi Metro maxed out at 20.  This means that instead of rewarding reputation caches I now get these bonus honor chests every 500 reputation.  Weirdly it feels like they actually happen more often than those last few ranks of the reputation. Now that I have maxed them both though, there really is no difference between choosing the destinations, because they all give the same rewards.  Since I like the Red Sea Rift a bit better, I will probably just keep doing this one each day.  I&#8217;ve also maxed out world exploration on both areas, so there is nothing really new to find out there as I have found it all.  I am really ready for them to add a new area to the game, and hoping it comes in soon with the seasonal reset.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30107" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251017-125032430.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I also finished up the main story quest on my completely free account, and have since pushed it to level 70.  The biggest challenge I have with this account is trying to remember what I need to progress when.  I am essentially working on getting a few different champions to bronze, but a lot of this is gated by the fact that I have not pushed up to level 80 yet. Right now I am alternating between grinding out artifacts, and doing things that will give me materials needed to upgrade my weapons from 70 to 80 when the time comes. I have Jolder and Ning Fei on this account, and will probably push them up first&#8230;  and then maybe Wolf so that I have a champion of each element.  If I pull Helhest, that might change the calculus a little bit.  I also have Rossi-11 on the account and have been playing it quite a bit, but nothing really beats Ning Fei for speed clears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This continues to be a phenomenal gaming experience. I actually played a little bit of Destiny 2 over the weekend&#8230; and I have to say that Destiny Rising just feels better.  I am sure I will shift gears soon to the new Path of Exile league, but for the moment I am all in on space magic.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/20/grandmasters-or-bust/">GrandMasters or Bust</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/20/grandmasters-or-bust/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '30097'}

I&#8217;m still on my Destiny Rising bullshit, I think in large part because I don&#8217;t really have another game to obsess about.  That is going to change a bit towards the end of this month because I will have the first part of the latest Guild Wars 2 expansion to play (28th), and then a brand new Path of Exile league following closely after that (31st).  I will likely be ping ponging between those games, while still doing my dailies in Destiny Rising from that point forward.  That probably means that I will let the second account that I rolled up to create the guild lapse a bit, because I won&#8217;t be mainlining the game quite so hard.  I did however give them some more money and bought the Crow outfit for Helhest because I still think it is badass.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30073" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251017-072003926.png?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest news since yesterday is that I managed to push Helhest up to gold rank which unlocked another significant boost to exotic mod drop rates.  That really is the piece that I need to focus on farming right now.  I have decent artifacts for most of my champions, but have next to nothing in the exotic mod department.  I did manage to get a single pierce exotic mod that would work for Hellhest&#8217;s linear fusion rifle, and that was the thing that pushed me over the light cap for gold. The champion that I am probably going to work on next is either pushing Umeko up to Gold, or spending some time focusing on Ning Fei because after getting him on my second account&#8230;  I&#8217;ve come to realize that I actually really like playing him. Umeko is probably my favorite pure sniper though, because of the self healing benefits.  However if I need to take a precision champion somewhere&#8230; I am probably going to be playing Helhest for the broader versatility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30076" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251016-152940486.png?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the second account, over lunch I tried to run a bunch of gauntlet ops, and ran into some friction.  This is the first time in the community I have been kicked from a group&#8230; seemingly because I had low light levels.  It happened twice while trying the run the Gauntlet Break In part of the raid.  The irony behind this is that in the teams that I managed to get into&#8230;  I dusted them hard, and was one of the key players doing the mechanics.  More so I ran a strike with Ning Fei and was less than half the light level of the other players&#8230; but did 71% of the damage.  Please for the love of god.. do not judge players for being new lights, because sure everyone wants an easy run&#8230;  but there are a ton of folks running second accounts in this game and you can never tell when that new light might be a ringer. Additionally it is just a dick move to try and be exclusionary like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30077" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251016-141148995.png?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of what has made my alt Ning Fei so powerful so quickly, is that I managed to get the exotic crossbow to drop as well.  That account is shaping up to be pretty freaking strong with both Jolder and Ning Fei.  Hopefully I can pull a Helhest while this event is still going on.  It sucks that it will be a long time before it has access to Gwynn or Estela since those banners are over.  I am guessing when the new content goes in early next year hinted in that trailer, that Gwynn and Estela might be joining the permanent banner at that point. I am still having a lot of fun with Destiny Rising, even though I know I am probably switching gears especially when the Path of Exile and Guild Wars 2 expansions drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which we have a name for the expansion, a theme for the expansion, and a reveal date of the 23rd.  Keepers of the Flame seems like maybe this is going to relate to the Acolyte of Chayula from Path of Exile II.  Then the theme of the expansion feels like it is going to be Breach focused, and maybe a significant upgrade to the way that it works. The hand jump scare, specially looks like the hand shaped &#8220;wings&#8221; on the back of Xesht who serves as the boss of Breach in Path of Exile II.  I think essentially, we are seeing more content that knits the storyline between the two games together a bit, and maybe serves as a gap closer between the events and organizations that appear in the 20 year gap.  It That Fled, one of the Betrayal NPCs specifically talks about the Hive, so yeah&#8230;.  it feels like we are getting a Breach upgrade league. It does make me wonder how sweeping of a change it is going to end up being.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally there are going to be some sweeping changes coming to Diablo IV.  It feels like we JUST started Season 10, and that it is way too soon to begin talking about Season 11&#8230;  but apparently they are just about to start up the PTR on October 21st.  Due to this they dropped some <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243142/sanctuary-ignites-with-itemization-systems-changes">big patch notes</a>, and Raxx also released a video talking about them.  I am seeing some things that will probably be really good for the game, namely changes to how Masterworking and Tempering functions to be a bit more deterministic.  They are however talking about making combat harder&#8230; which worries me because really the point of a Diablo game is getting to a place where you can blow up entire screens.  The game itself is not mechanically enjoyable enough to really lean into the soulslike direction like Path of Exile II did.  However that said&#8230; I am not even sure what sort of unique niche this game can carve out.  It will always be a shallower version of better games like Path of Exile or Last Epoch, because it is not growing over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29936" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Diablo_IV-20251001-071930273.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  Diablo IV is a pretty good game.  It is fun in small doses, but there just isn&#8217;t really a lot going on&#8230; and they are squandering the seasonal model to keep creating thoroughly disposable content.  Each season comes with a new borrowed power system, and a new faction to grind&#8230; which gives you rewards that will all be washed away the next time a season rolls out.  Last Epoch and Path of Exile 1/2 create permanent changes to the game that grow the depth and complexity each time a season/league happens.  Not everything goes &#8220;core&#8221;, but enough does that it makes the game feel like it is growing and changing in interesting ways.  Diablo IV more or less feels the same today as it did at the launch of its DLC&#8230;  because there is nothing really new to do that did not go in with that DLC.  Sure they have moved the chess pieces around on the board, by shifting this or that balance&#8230;. but at the end of the day you still have to grind the same endgame that existed a year ago when Vessel of Hatred launched.  We are about to be eleven seasons deep into this franchise and have very little to show for it. I think more than anything&#8230; the game disappoints me, because it could be a better game than it is now.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30078" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BravelyDefault-GrindingSandworms.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that I am playing that I have not really talked much about is Bravely Default, on my Switch 2 hooked to my new television downstairs.  This is a super chill activity that I often do when I am winding down for the night, and at the moment I am largely in Act 2 and grinding levels right in front of Ancheim. At some point I am going to swap up the jobs of everyone so that they can learn a second trait line.  Currently I have Edea as Knight, Tiz as Monk, Agnes as White Mage, and Ringabel as Black Mage&#8230; and I am going to swap my two martial fighters and my two magic users so they are cross trained.  I find grinding levels in turn based JRPGs deeply relaxing, and especially since this one has an auto mode where you can set up a set of attacks and just have them follow them over and over.  I am not really sure what level I am going to call &#8220;good enough&#8221; to move forward, but right now I am mostly farming until I have enough gold to buy all of the upgrades available in town.  I like overpowering content, and do not really want to have to think about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyways.  I hope you all have a wonderful weekend.  It is supposed to be cooler again, so I will likely be working on the south half of the garage.  Once I have finished with everything I will probably post before and after photos.  It was a complete mess, and it is becoming less of one, every time I go out there and work.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/17/golden-helhest-and-hiveborn/">Golden Helhest and Hiveborn</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/17/golden-helhest-and-hiveborn/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '30069'}

This most important thing that I do every day&#8230; is find one of the cats in Haven and figure out what fish it wants to eat.  This is harder than it sounds&#8230;  because you are having to translate what is often poorly translated features&#8230; and then playing a guessing game as to what exactly a &#8220;Plump Fish&#8221; is. Whoever added this feature to the game is delightful&#8230;  because they fucking nailed this feature.  The cat &#8220;chirps&#8221; are on point&#8230; and enough so that if I were not playing with headphones it would freak my cats out. I don&#8217;t love the fishing mini game&#8230;  but I keep doing it so I can make sure I have the right fish that these adorable darlings want on a given day.  Please note&#8230; the gift that they give me back&#8230; is in no way actually worth doing this thing.  I just get brief sparks of joy from feeding these virtual cats.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30062" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251015-184804046.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ace and I made a date to meet up last night and burn through some of our challenge keys.  When you get deep into this game you can access much harder versions of existing content, and one of the things we had never participated in was &#8220;Master&#8221; difficulty of Gauntlet Blitz.  Now the normal version of Gauntlet Blitz is generally a pretty chill activity, one you can absolutely complete without much issue using a group of bots.  Master difficulty however does not exist with bots&#8230; and apparently few people are trying to run it.  So we started this madness with just us attempting to learn the mechanics and slowly over time more people joined in until we finally had five players.  There were these crazy singularities that would spawn&#8230; and slowly pull us in so we had to stop everything we were doing and dps them down to keep from getting instagibbed.  This made the entire experience way more stressful&#8230; but also way more enjoyable.  I would love to do this content with a full group of people I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30064" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251015-170744872.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the cool features of the game is that you can borrow characters from your friends, so it is actually pretty beneficial to friend random players who perform well in content with you. I have a well geared Helhest, but I noticed that Ace&#8217;s was a bit higher than mine so I borrowed her for an attempt at a Challenge Difficulty version of the Legendary Campaign.  Side note&#8230;  this apparently DOES not count for any of the objectives on your ascendancy.  I made decent time, and did not take any deaths&#8230; but did not get credit towards her &#8220;do challenge legendary campaign without dying&#8221;.  So seemingly if you borrow a character it will not count towards your achievement unlocks.  Mostly just throwing this out there so someone does not get disappointed like I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30065" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251015-164255387.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Helhest, I completed another phase of her story and I am really enjoying this particular plot thread.  Spoilers ahead so be warned if you care about such things. Destiny 1/2 players have a long relationship with Mara Sov the Queen of the reef, this story-line deeply involves her and what appears to be an AI Consciousness backup known as the White Queen. Helhest in her pre-resurrection life was a Crow, and specifically a Crow tasks with hunting down the White Queen and assassinating her and anyone guarding her. I&#8217;ve always thought the whole memory wipe that comes with resurrection as a lightbearer an interesting part of this whole setting.  I remember they brought back Mara Sov&#8217;s brother as a Guardian in Destiny 2&#8230; and that felt weird&#8230; considering how icky and awful he was during his normal life.  So this is a similar story thread, and it is interesting unpacking Helhest&#8217;s former life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30067" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251016-075349385.png?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Being completely honest. Helhest is the first time I have been tempted to give them money for the cosmetic outfit set. The crow outfit looks fucking badass.  Thing is I really like this character and it is probably going to be my primary arc damage character that I run.  I am working on pushing her light levels up, and will probably spend my stamina to run a bunch of chaos trials today in order to try and get a full set of exotic artifacts for her.  Once I have that, I should be able to push the light levels up to a sufficient place, and if I get the rare runestones from the wheel of fortune event I should be able to complete gold this week/weekend. The game just keeps throwing discounts at me&#8230;  which I know is the trap that they keep hoping I will spend more money.  However like I said I am legitimately considering picking up this sweet outfit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We got a teaser trailer dropped for where the story is going&#8230; and I am pumped, other than the whole &#8220;Coming in 2026&#8221; part.  The game really needs to drop some more story content soon. In theory we will have another season between now and then, because the Season of Daybreak is coming to a close soon.  So I am hoping with it comes another destination and maybe some more activities.  However I am pumped that we are at least leaving the planet at some point, because the teaser trailer shows a spaceship.  I am hoping this game gets a version of the Dreadnaught from Destiny 1, because that was one of my favorite environments to explore.  I loved all of the weird unlocks and jumping puzzles and ended up getting us our first sword if I am remembering correctly. I love the Hive and the nonsense of Oryx, Savathuun, and Xivu Arath&#8230;  and we have already seen that Crota exists in this setting which means Oryx likely does as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30063" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251015-175515675.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish the whole mobile nature of the game was not a massive turn off to most folks.  It is shockingly good, and for a gacha game it is weirdly fair about its spending. In a worst case scenario, if you the the worst possible luck&#8230;  just the act of pulling a new character is at most around $50. However I have never made it all of the way to pity once&#8230;  before getting a new character.  So far with Helhast I have had outrageous luck and pulled 3 copies of her just using my banked up resources.  I am continuing to pull on that banner as I get free currency because I am wondering just how many stars I can unlock before that banner ends.  This is putting me in a bad position for the next banner&#8230; but like I said, I really like this character.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/16/fish-for-cats/">Fish for Cats</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/16/fish-for-cats/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '30060'}

Yesterday I took the day off and it was needed. I didn&#8217;t really get much of anything accomplished, but after yesterday&#8217;s emotional blog post&#8230;  and tears that followed&#8230;  I think I just needed a day to fall apart. I spent a good chunk of the day playing Destiny Rising.  If you have ever loved Destiny at any point in its history, you owe it to yourself to check this game out.  While I have spent money on my main account, I have created an alt account that is entirely free to play, and quite honestly&#8230;  I have plenty of good stuff to make playing that account enjoyable.  It has been interesting to see how fast I can progress it through the ranks and am already up to heroic content.  Which means that I get to have the exciting grind of collecting all of the mythic weapons all over again.  Over on my main account I am mostly spending my time learning Helhest, the new Arc champion and think I am going to add her to my more focused lineup since I already have Jolder to represent Void, and Estela to represent Fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30056" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251014-221703796.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest news from yesterday is that we managed to get the Greysky Armada guild online in Destiny Rising.  You&#8217;ve likely heard me complaining about the process of creating a guild&#8230; and it is in fact even more onerous than I expected.  Firstly everyone has to be available during a 24 hour period to join the guild, and has to leave their existing packs before they can even be invited. I am not sure if extended friendships are not important to the Chinese player base&#8230; but every single one of these mobile games has an awful guild system.  In AFK Journey you get thrown on random servers and can ONLY ever invite people from that random server.  We cheated in getting this guild off the ground when Ace and I realized that we could easily create alt accounts.  With our alts and a handful of people actively playing , we managed to get the guild up and running and actually leveled it up the first time and upgraded the hangar to level 2.  If you are playing this game and a reader of this blog, feel free to join the guild.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30052" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251015-064157048.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am pretty pleased with our progress for a single day of doing pack hunt.  Granted this was swapping between two accounts and running missions to uncover more ground.  Essentially I was trying to find one of the strongholds, because I have never actually managed to do one of those and thought maybe with a guild of people I actually know I might be able to arrange a time when we could have three people on at the same time.  The mountain ranges are somewhat infuriating because you have a bunch of highlighted areas around the map, and inevitably you will run into a wall that is not passable that will cause you to waste a bunch of turns. Sadly the community has not figured out the pattern to these maps so it isn&#8217;t like the Labyrinth in Path of Exile where you can see where you are going each week.  You sort of have to just poke around in the darkness trying to find resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30055" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251015-064255207.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In other news, I managed to get the currency needed to push Estela up to gold and clear the logjam that was halding my ascendancy points.  So I went immediately from 24 to 30, and have since pushed it up to 31.  Right now I am working on getting Helhest up to gold, but have quite a bit of work left to go on her.  I knocked out Silver on her last night, and am working on farming a set of exotic artifacts so that I can properly equip her.  I am not sure if I can just do the equip highest and get her past the hurdle or not.  I essentially need another round of the rare materials in order to push her up to gold anyways, so I am likely going to be in a holding pattern for a bit.  I might start working on some of the other characters and knocking out bronze and silver so that I can get more points and raise my ascendancy level up a bit while I am waiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30057" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251014-205456773.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve continued pulling on the Helhest banner since I like the character so much, hoping to get more copies and ultimately more talent tree points. This has led to an abomination&#8230;  and I now have a 6 star version of Finnala.  Like there is nothing inherently wrong with Finnala, she just does not have that great of a kit.  She is ultimately a less useful version of Wolf, and the big problem I have with her is that she has no range abilities.  This means that you are essentially left in the dust while running content on her because Destiny Rising is like every other game where you do the same content over and over&#8230; and it is go go go go go. She is perfectly cromulent for doing content planet side, and that is honestly have I have ranked up most of her reputation doing dailies, because she is really good when it requires fire stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30058" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251014-201318203.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of abominations&#8230; we finally got our Trikora match and it was just as hilarious as we expected it to be.  We honestly did better than I expected, but due to seemingly no one queuing for shifting sands, we ended up in there with two human teams, and everything else bots.  We did fairly well and I think we placed second overall, but it was a massive difference between playing against human players and bots.  The bots were way more aggressive&#8230;  and actively tried to hunt us down constantly&#8230;  but were also sort of dumb.  The one time we ran into a human team unprepared we were quickly wiped. However we wrecked the bots in pretty much every encounter.  This is a bad ideas match up&#8230;. but was super funny to play through.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30054" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251015-065844151.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mostly right now I am going to be playing a lot of Helhest so that I can unlock the last bits of her storyline.  So far I really like it and she is one of the more interesting characters in the game.  I legitimately like her both in her skill set and the story that is being told. I think this was also part of the reason why I bonded with Estela so hard, is because the story that was being told was actually really good. Helhest would be better if you did not have to keep resummoning the drones&#8230;  but then again they probably learned their lesson with Estela.  The little manta ray things that she summons are constantly running ahead of the players and clearing objectives before anyone has a chance to get to them. Helhest though is a beast when it comes to a burn phase because pending she has all three drones up&#8230;  you can just wreck a boss big time.  This is absolutely my sniper of choice going forward, and I have contemplated burning down Umeko just to get the resources back to spend them on Helhest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyways.  Destiny Rising is fucking great.  You should check it out, and when you do&#8230; join our guild.  Legitimately though, if you ever enjoyed Destiny at some point in the past, you are going to love this game.  I personally find it way more enjoyable than Destiny ever was.  I just hope we get some more world content soon at the end of this season.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/15/a-guild-of-greys/">A Guild of Greys</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/15/a-guild-of-greys/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '30051'}

This is going to be one of those blog posts that does not get syndicated widely, because it is going to be a bummer.  Last night I fell asleep on the couch around 7ish&#8230;  went to bed around 8pm&#8230; and then slept until almost 7 am.  This represents probably the longest I have slept in years.  I feel like the wheels are falling off now.  Technically I am still functional.  I am getting up and showing, feeding myself, doing responsible work things, and making sure the house stays at moderate levels of cleanliness&#8230;  but I feel like I am not really living. I am still chipping away at the giant mess in the garage, and am about halfway through.  Essentially the north side is finished with cabinets set up and things moved into them&#8230; and I need to attack the south side and effectively do the same.  I have a pile of shit in the garage that at some point I will call the folks to haul away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t say with all certainty that nothing brings me joy&#8230;  but more&#8230;  I have forgotten what joy feels like.  I feel like I have been cosplaying someone who has their shit together in the whole &#8220;fake it until you make it&#8221; genre&#8230;  but I am just not sure if I will ever get there.  This week is hard. It is fall break for all of the schools in Oklahoma, and I did not even know this until a coworker asked for it off to spend time with his family.  This was always a big week for us and we almost always had some sort of project going on that we would complete.  If nothing else it was a time when I took off from work and we spent quality time together.  We would often go for trips elsewhere like down to Dallas, up to Kansas City, or over to St Louis to visit friends. I could do all of these things&#8230;  but I just don&#8217;t really feel like doing so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last Friday was really hard too, because there was a cookout essentially in honor of my wife&#8230;  but not having her&#8230;  made the social interaction almost unbearable. People talk about having emotional support animals&#8230;  but my wife was my emotional support human and I miss her greatly.  No matter how uncomfortable a situation got&#8230; I always had her, and I always knew that she understood that my skin was crawling and that I wanted to run into the night screaming at the top of my lungs. How do you condense 30 years of moments shared&#8230;  into even beginning to rebuild that connection with anyone else? I feel like my life is over&#8230; and I am just this shambling husk that remains, because all of the good that was in me was sucked out the night I came out of the bathroom and found her making that awful gurgling noise on the couch. My life ended on July 2nd&#8230;  and everything that I am doing now&#8230; is just a vague attempt at distracting me from that fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing that is really hard&#8230; is that in theory they should have installed the gravestone last week.  There is a certain finality in that act.  Like until that happened it almost wasn&#8217;t &#8220;really real&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve not gone up to check, because its a two hour drive away, and I am not even sure if I should be doing that drive by myself.  I had been waiting on a call from the funeral home to let me know that it was installed&#8230; but they have also been pretty much incompetent at every step of this process.  They did not tell me when the death certificates were available, did not tell me when the final death certificates were available, and did not tell me when they had a mock-up of the tombstone ready for me to review. If I did not have a &#8220;fuck this is taking forever&#8221; moment at each step&#8230; I would not have gotten any of the information. So basically&#8230; I have Schrodinger&#8217;s tombstone right now&#8230; and the only way I am going to know for certain is if I make the drive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not gone to the grave site&#8230; since the day we buried her because&#8230;  there has never felt like much of a point.  She is not there anymore.  My wife herself firmly believed that, and thought the whole visiting graves thing was a bit weird. I mean if she is anywhere&#8230; she would be here since she died in the driveway. Not that I understand the mechanics of hauntings mind you&#8230;  but it would seem like the place someone dies would be more potent than the place where their remains end up. I know at some point I will need to go.  I will need to at least for the sake of her family make the effort of decorating her grave, since they all seem to care deeply about that sort of thing. I am agnostic at best&#8230; and atheist at worst&#8230;  and I have always struggled with the rituals of a predominantly evangelical society. I know I have people who are willing to be there for me&#8230; but what they can offer me&#8230; isn&#8217;t what I need.  I need my wife back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have friends who are pushing me to get back into therapy.  Essentially how the free therapy works is that you get five sessions per instance.  In theory I could just keep making up a reason for why I need therapy, because it is only ever dealt with at the inception of the therapy&#8230; and not during the sessions themselves.  It did help&#8230;  but only those first three of five sessions or so. I think I might just be going through a low spot with the changing of the seasons and the coming of the season of darkness.  I&#8217;ve never had seasonal affective disorder&#8230;  my wife had that&#8230;  and I have always cursed the existence of the sun.  However maybe I do need to get out more and at least pretend I am a daywalker. I am trying to get out and about more on the weekends, but mostly just because I have things I need to get done.  I know today I am going to run to the recycling place because it was entirely too full on Sunday, and I never unloaded the boxes from my truck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe I just needed to cry for awhile.  I have been doing so while I write this post, and am honestly feeling a bit better as a result.  Unfortunately crying is not one of those things that you can just sort of force to happen. Maybe I needed to get some of the sadness out of me. I will say that I would be completely lost if not for Gracie and how needy of attention she is. So many of the things I did&#8230; because I was trying to take care of my wife.  Without her&#8230;  it just doesn&#8217;t feel like there is a point to doing any of them.  I have mostly been going through the motions because the routines are familiar&#8230;  but there is no passion behind it anymore. I think I am going to cut this blog post off, because if you have read down to this point&#8230;  you are a real one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not sure if I have been lying to you&#8230; when I say that I am fine&#8230; or if this week just got to be too much and I fell apart.  I am broken, and I have to admit that I am broken.  I just am not sure if I will ever be fixed.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/14/ineffective-cosplay/">Ineffective Cosplay</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/14/ineffective-cosplay/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5', 'post-id': '30049'}

This weekend I decided to focus on trying to get the pack up and going.  We almost have enough to form a pack on our own, and quite honestly&#8230; I think once we have a pack going it will be easier to recruit folks to play the game. One of the cool things about MuMuPlayer is that they realize that people are probably going to at some point try playing multiple accounts&#8230;  like is often the case with Gacha games.  So there is a built in functionality to spin up new emulator sessions.  This is often done for folks who want to keep playing the game, but have long run out of the &#8220;stamina&#8221; mechanic for that game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30042" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxMain-20251012-185222501.jpg?w=880&#038;ssl=1" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First you have to enable multi-instance support from the emulator when it is running through the &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; menu up at the top. Then once you get into that you can create new instances of android.  I named mine after the accounts that I used to create them so I can keep them straight.  Unfortunately this means that you are going to have to go through the process of installing Destiny Rising on each instance, which will also mean that when a patch gets applied&#8230; you have to manually patch them up as well.  I am MOSTLY doing this so that I can get an extra signature to make sure that the pack gets created smoothly.  However Ace&#8217;s spouse has recently started playing, so I might start running around on this character, because the grouping we did last night&#8230; was a bit overpowered with us playing our mains.  That is not to say that I won&#8217;t likely catch this account up quickly however.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30044" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251012-190910763.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to roll with a Femme character this time around, but I have to say&#8230;  just like with the Masculine options&#8230;  there really were none that I necessarily liked.  In both cases they were overwhelmingly soft features&#8230;  which seemed odd for someone who is this big warrior type.  Destiny had somewhat shitty character model options too, and I always got around this by playing an Exo.  Unfortunately there are no Exo or Awoken options for Destiny Rising.  I am hoping at some point we get the option to reroll our character features, because I kind of hate the void and appearance of my main character.  I don&#8217;t necessarily love this second character&#8230; but the voice I chose is a little less &#8220;Golly Gee Willikers&#8221; about everything. Green hair is always the correct option&#8230; I blame Robotech for setting that preference early on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30045" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251012-193709331.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The second account is a bit lucky&#8230;  as I did my first few pulls off the permanent banner and already have a Jolder.  I also got Ikora early and pulled Xuan Wei, Attal, and the newest 4 star Rossi-11.  That is a pretty decent blend of characters to play.  I will not be spending a single dime on this second account, and mostly will find it interesting to see if there is any difference between a purely free account and one where I have bought the subscription and battle pass. Of all of the characters to pull though&#8230;  Jolder is probably my favorite of the baseline mythic characters. It will be interesting to see if I end up unlocking everything on this account.  Sadly the Gwynn and Estela banners are long gone, and those are characters I really enjoy on my main account. Helhest is pretty great, but nowhere near as good as either of those characters.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30038" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251013-072516425.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Over on my main account I am a bit stuck. There is a material needed for high level artifact gilding, and it only comes from the Expanse.  I have earned my two for this cycle, and am now stuck waiting another 10 days for the expanse to reset so I can earn another two.  I could in theory earn more by clearing another difficulty level&#8230;  but quite frankly I am getting wrecked. I&#8217;ve gotten up to wave 19 in the second tier and am just getting shredded by these hyper melee focused mobs that bum rush me&#8230;  and the objective that I am supposed to keep from taking damage.  I am just not skilled enough to get through it with my current light levels on Estella, but I need to push her to a gold medal in order to unlock the next tier of ascension.  I could in theory reset progress on Jolder and claw back those resources&#8230;  but that seems like a bad idea since I love playing Jolder.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30046" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251012-145711780.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In other news, I pulled Riskrunner from the Legendary Campaign&#8230;  but unfortunately don&#8217;t really have the resources to push it up high enough to be useful.  This is a solid option for Jolder to use as a primary weapon.  Especially if I take any arc damage, Riskrunner used to be brutal in specific content in Destiny 2. I am going to push it up as far as I can just so I can run a few rounds with it to see how good it feels in this game. Unfortunately when it comes to progression&#8230; I am not even in a place where I can buy my way out of the problem by spending real world money.  Like good on them for not making spending money the answer to the issues&#8230;  but also it feels kind of bad that I have reached a point in the end game where progression happens every two weeks&#8230; rather than weekly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30041" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Destiny1-Plaguelands.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been playing a bit of Destiny 1 on the PlayStation 5, and it is wild to me how much more atmospheric that game feels as compared to Destiny 2&#8230;  and by reference the style that Destiny Rising adopted.  There is just so much going on in scenes and the weather effects feel like they play a much larger role in setting the scene.  The lighting is much moodier and I think it really fits the almost horror elements of the Destiny universe.  Of course this is from roaming around the Plaguelands, which is the very last area that was added to the game right before the launch of Destiny 2.  But this also reminds me of how Destiny 2 in many ways felt like a step backwards&#8230; instead of a step forward.  Rise of Iron was such a great expansion, and the game felt so much better at that point than the baseline Destiny 2 experience at launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30043" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gw2-64-20251012-175048436.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly we have a bit of Guild Wars 2 progress.  Yesterday afternoon I was running Fractals to complete one of the weeklies and happened upon completing an achievement that gave me one Core Tyria mastery point.  This was the last one that I needed to pick up my final Core Tyria mastery the Scholar of Secrets, finishing out the legendary crafting path.  The irony is I have a stack of Legendaries thanks to the starter kits, but I guess if I ever want to craft the Heart of Thorns ones I have all of the necessary training. Running random Fractals is still a heck of a lot of fun, and I really look forward to this system going in for Raids and Strikes.  Just being able to hop in on a Saturday afternoon and pop into some instant groups and complete that weekly was an extremely nice feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully yall had a pretty great weekend.  I feel like I need to start crafting a Destiny Rising Tools page like I have for other games, because there is not a ton of infrastructure out there for up to date information.  If nothing it will give me a spot to jot things down as I learn them. I am extremely sold on that game, and if you ever liked Destiny at any point in the past, I highly suggest giving it a spin.  Soon I hope to have a pack to be able to invite folks to.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/13/second-account-shenanigans/">Second Account Shenanigans</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/13/second-account-shenanigans/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '30037'}

Last night I officially started the Mad King festivities as we spend our normal few hours of guild nonsense running around the labyrinth.  It was a pretty fun time, and eventually we largely followed around a tag.  However not before some random idiot seemed to take very hostile offense to us having our own private tag since we outgrew the size of a normal party.  I mean we could have dogpiled on the other tag&#8230;  but technically we were there first, and also after a point it became about the principle of the situation.  We were calm and reasonable in map chat, but this other person was actively cursing us out&#8230;  which does not befit the chill that Guild Wars 2 normally has.  I would blame this on the folks filing in from World of Warcraft&#8230;  but this dude had the <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hall_of_Monuments_(achievements)#God_Walking_Amongst_Mortals">God Walking Amongst Mortals title</a>&#8230;  so they were a special brand of asshole.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30014" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gw2-64-20251009-191257180.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That said&#8230;  it did not really put a serious hamper on our fun, because the biggest component of Guild Wars 2 Thursdays is hanging out on discord and talking about all manner of nonsense.  During which Sita the robot&#8230; relayed to us some concerning details that deeply concerned me&#8230;  but then again&#8230; that is every week.  Joking aside though it is a heck of a lot of fun just to hang out for a bit and do some relatively low effort gaming.  This is the part of MMORPGs that I had been missing, and I am glad that I finally got off my ass and tried to wrangle folks to do something together.  It doesn&#8217;t necessarily happy EVER week, but more often than not we are doing fractals or something similar in Guild Wars 2 every Thursday.  If we had more folks&#8230; we would try strikes or something that requires slightly more effort.  However for now&#8230; the Labyrinth was exactly the right amount of nonsense.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30009" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFKJourney-CatchingUp.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to Guild Wars 2 shenanigans I spent a bit trying to catch AFK Journey up on the quest chain.  While I don&#8217;t talk about it very often, I tend to play this game every night before falling asleep at least enough to do some of the dailies.  However I tend to batch the story up and grind it all down in a single go, or in this current case a series of attempts. I think I am nearing the end of this current storyline and I have to say this is one of my favorite so far.  I really like the character of Gala and I will kill anyone who threatens to harm her. I&#8217;ve started running AFK Journey on the same MuMuPlayer that I use to play Destiny Rising, and it is pretty great for batch doing auto battles to raise various ranks.  If you play this game feel free to friend me up and my ID is 39949620.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30011" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251009-211837245.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday was the release of a new 5 star banner in Destiny Rising, and I had been banking up my pulls for this event.  I had phenomenal luck and also spent a little money&#8230;  and managed to pull 3 copies of her, and 2 copies of the new 4 star which seems WAY harder to get than Umeko was.  They also threw Finnala and Ikora on the same banner&#8230; which means you are going to get way more copies of them as a result.  Sadly neither of them are terribly useful characters other than our PVPVE nonsense.  Maybe when we finish with the Ikora madness we should do Nala matches instead. The new champ is pretty cool is both 5 star and 4 star represent the very first bow characters.  Thankfully you can pull an Exotic bow, the Trinity Ghoul off the battlepass which greatly improves their functionality.  Helhest is ALMOST a great character&#8230;  but unfortunately the normal drones don&#8217;t follow you around.  Still it is a solid arc champion that has the ability to make heavy weapon ammo out of thin air&#8230;  and represents a pretty great support character.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30018" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251009-132824299.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another cool thing that I think went in with this update, is there are not a ton of outfits available for purchase with ONLY bright dust.  This might have been a thing before, but up until this point I thought they required both bright dust and silver.  As a result I snapped up outfits for all of the characters that I play regularly.  I specifically love this Estela outfit, since green is already one of my favorite colors and green and red is the combination that I tend to build around in Guild Wars 2.  My guess is that we were just interpreting the cost of these outfits incorrectly, because I cannot see that so many people spent silver on the green Tan-2 as I have run up against doing events.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30017" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251009-142429579.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time in the Chaos Trials of the Nine, because I desperately need an Exotic Artifact for the fourth slot. This is essentially all that is standing between me and getting my Jolder to gold, and unlocking the next batch of ascension points. I&#8217;ve refactored all of my exotic artifacts to 2500+, and I think at this point the process is just wasting resources to go any higher.  Essentially I am only getting an upgrade when I max out the pity luck on the refactors.  If I had ONE more exotic artifact I could push it up to 2500 as well and get across the finish line.  The other thing that is actively hurting me is that I am not using an exotic weapon on Jolder, and have not found any Exotic weapon mods that will fit into the submachine gun.  All of the rapid fire mods that I can pull from the mod choice engrams&#8230;  seem to only want to be slotted into the Autorifle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30020" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251009-132408725-1.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if they did not make the changes to bright dust in this patch&#8230; I still feel like they are getting less stingy with alternate outfits in general.  I pulled this alternate outfit for Jolder off the normal banner, and then this alternate outfit for Helhest off the new limited banner.  I am not the biggest fan of the yellow and grey look for Helhest, but I love the Pink and Purple Jolder and am pretty much using that all the time now.  I would love to pull an updated shield to match it at some point, especially given that Jolder right now is my main character that I am playing.  It is weird how I originally thought Wolf was so cool, and then as I have played more of the game I have effectively completely abandoned him for greener pastures.  I think the thing that could improve Wolf is if they would do the thing that the Mihoyo games do and allow you to change up his element and weapon loadout.  If they made it so Wolf could learn how to use any weapons and any element&#8230;  it would make them way more useful in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-30016" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251009-142718009.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got a cookout thing going on tonight, so I am realistically not going to get much in the way of gaming.  I also have an in person all day event going on at work, so I am going to be exceptionally work out from the combo of both of those events landing on the same day.  Tomorrow I need to get up relatively early and run some errands, but after that I am probably going to grind Realm of the Nine until my eyes bleed&#8230; or I get an exotic artifact for the fourth slot. Other than that I fully expect to spend some time doing the Labyrinth grind in Guild Wars 2 and maybe try and knock out some of the other seasonal events.  I&#8217;ve never attempted the jumping puzzle&#8230;  so I might give that a spin even though I hate jumping puzzles.  Sadly I don&#8217;t think you can do the teleport to friend nonsense to bypass this one.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/10/tricks-and-treats/">Tricks and Treats</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/10/tricks-and-treats/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'post-id': '30008'}

Ace and I got together early in the evening and ran around a bunch of Destiny Rising. Of course we had to do our Ikora nonsense, and we realized there was a clear pattern.  We have the first round where we do pretty damned good, and honestly rank fairly high overall.  For example once again last night we got 2nd place overall and for most of the match we were running in the first place spot.  Then immediately after that&#8230;  we had a round where we spent most of it dead&#8230; and finished in last place.  However at this point we only have two more rounds of Shifting Gates in order to complete the objective of running 10 with Ikora.  At that point we are probably going to keep doing it&#8230; but just play more reasonable characters.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29991" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251008-173943156.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of the Ikora nonsense we did two raids last night that went exceptionally smoothly.  It makes me wonder if folks are finally starting to grok the mechanics in there, or if there is just no one but hardcore players queuing for it these days.  We also did a Master strike, but it was one with Precision Shinka&#8217;s which meant that I took one for the team and played Tan-2.  I really need to buff him up quite a bit, but I am mostly focused on trying to get Jolder up high enough so that I can get a gold medal and get unstuck from my present light level logjam.  Ace managed to move past it with their Estela which of course makes me feel like I am falling behind heh.  I did pull a new Exotic weapon out of the master strike, and it is supposedly pretty powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29987" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MuMuNxDevice-20251008-202254416.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This of course meant I had to drop down to a planet and give it a spin on Xuan Wei, the only character that currently can use a fusion rifle.  It is odd&#8230; basically instead of firing a spread of shots, you fire one giant grenade like slug.  I can see how it would make him significantly more powerful overall and given that there is no spread&#8230; you no longer need to get quite so close to a target in order to optimize the damage.  At some point I will probably run some Realm of the Nine with him to see how it feels doing proper content.  This is something I need to do more often in general, but right now I mostly need to run it as Jolder so I can get void upgrade materials. I think Ace passed me because Destiny Rising is one of the few games they are playing right now, whereas I have a stack of games that I am trying to rotate between.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29988" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Wow-20251009-074550813.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of other games&#8230; swapping over to a Demon Hunter seems like it was what I needed to get into Legion Remix.  I feel like Blizzard has done what Blizzard has always done&#8230; and fucked with the formula a bit to make it worse.  I feel like Panda Remix was accidentally a great game mode, that was released as a lark as filler content.  With Legion Remix they purposefully tried to design this content&#8230;  and as a result lost some of what made the previous incarnation great.  Namely it feels like they have significantly slowed down the progress.  What was so great about Panda is that it felt like you were grinding endgame content almost immediately&#8230; and this time around it feels like I have to properly level&#8230; which delays the enjoyment of grinding raids and such.  I am still having fun, the pacing just feels completely off from what it did in Panda.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29989" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Wow-20251008-103555048.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The flow of things is really weird too, because a lot of the class hall stuff seems to have been neutered, where you cannot run missions anymore.  They speed you past the general unlocking phases that were time gated which is a good thing, but it also feels like a lot of the content has been removed.  That said there is still a bunch of general unlocking of things content that has to be done, like retrieving your artifact weapons. This morning i started the process of unlocking Suramar and it does not seem to have gotten the timerunner treatment with things being sped up. Legion is still my favorite expansion in all of World of Warcraft, but it also does not feel anywhere near as fresh or exciting as it did with Panda.  I think it was just a new concept and now the novelty has worn off a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29990" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Wow-20251008-143959060.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That said I am still enjoying myself and am nearing level 40 in the first area that I chose to go to, Azshara. I still probably have over half of the zone left to go, and maybe I am making good progress overall&#8230;  but the pace just feels slower than Panda did. I am not really worrying to much about gear upgrades and I will batch up a couple dozen bronze chests while questing and then unlock all of them and scrap the excess.  Of course I have to break out my Yak every time to restore my cosmetic appearance, because that is more important to me than the gear levels currently. I am not sure if I am really getting back into the flow of World of Warcraft, but I am not bouncing as hard as I did with the Hunter or any time I have tried to quest through War Within.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-29993" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/aggronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gw2-64-20251009-081320626.jpg?resize=880%2C495&#038;ssl=1" width="880" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonight though is Guild Wars 2 with friends, and the vague plan is to group up and run amok in the Mad King&#8217;s Labyrinth.  I don&#8217;t think any of us have done much of anything from the Halloween event other than maybe opening some trick or treat bags. I remember having a lot of fun with the Labyrinth before, and mostly you just need to run around with a group because it is very easy to get overwhelmed quickly.  It has been years since I last participated in this event, so it should be a lot of fun with friends.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/09/jotunn-and-felblades/">Jotunn and Felblades</a> appeared first on <a href="https://aggronaut.com">Tales of the Aggronaut</a>.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://aggronaut.com/2025/10/09/jotunn-and-felblades/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '29986'}

The game appears (and plays) like an aquatic combination of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/18/coffee-talk-review/">Coffee Talk</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/15/steamworld-dig-2-review/">SteamWorld Dig</a></em>, which are both games I very much enjoy. I downloaded <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> upon release on Switch, but it fell into my backlog until this year; in recent months, I&#8217;ve gotten around to properly playing through the game, and I&#8217;m glad I did so &#8211; not only does it deliver on the rewarding gameplay loop and sumptuous pixel art graphics I hoped for, but it&#8217;s been an ideal showcase for chilled handheld gaming on the Nintendo Switch 2!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting the review, I&#8217;d like to mention the brief controversy around <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, as I remember it adding unfair caution to my approach to the game. Back in 2023, the game was nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards, which drew criticism because the game wasn&#8217;t an Indie game &#8211; the developer MINTROCKET was a subsidiary of Nexon, a lucrative South Korean company. The developers were not responsible for the game being nominated, and it appears that the nomination was based off of the pixel art graphics and relaxed alternative vibe of the game, instead of the literal definition of an independent company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, the CEO of MINTROCKET &#8211; and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> creator &#8211; Jaeho Hwang said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>“I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like a more detailed explanation and opinion, I highly recommend <a href="https://indiecator.org/2023/11/15/why-is-dave-the-diver-not-indie/">this post on <em>Indiecator</em> by MagiWasTaken</a>, which discusses the situation in better detail than I could in this short review introduction. Ironically, it&#8217;s since been announced in 2024 that MINTROCKET is becoming independent (albeit with support from Nexon to carry out the move). My main point is that this controversy is not something to think ill of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> or MINTROCKET for, and that allowed me to dive into the game fresh. Right, that&#8217;s enough preamble, so let&#8217;s get into the review!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Catch of the Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> follows the story of Dave and his friends, who&#8217;ve travelled to the oceanic Blue Hole to set up a sushi restaurant called Bancho Sushi (named after the head chef Bancho). As the title suggests, Dave must dive underwater to collect the fish and ingredients, and this forms the majority of the game &#8211; you must balance risk and reward as you collect as much as Dave can carry, whilst keeping track of your oxygen levels and means to get back to the surface &#8211; either by swimming back up, or finding an Escape Pod point. If you run out of oxygen and get stranded underwater, you lose all but one of your collected items, which severely impacts the success of the sushi restaurant in the evenings. This risk/reward system is reminiscent of the digging in <em>SteamWorld Dig</em>, and is implemented superbly here &#8211; the player has to make the tough decision between keeping what they&#8217;ve got, or risking pushing a little further and potentially losing it all. It&#8217;s a brilliant gameplay loop that keeps you coming back for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15160" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15140" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15139" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The game eases you in gently, starting with introducing the mechanics of catching fish at a relatively shallow depth. Your main weapon is the harpoon, which can be fired in front of you to reel in fish. However, there&#8217;s a delay whilst the fish struggles, which gives other dangerous creatures the time to close in on Dave &#8211; and later on, the harpoon requires multiple hits and/or extra button combinations to capture stronger fish. There are also various items to discover and collect, either as supplementary ingredients found in submerged cooking pots, or as materials scattered on the sea floor. Dave only has a certain amount they can hold at once, which quickly becomes reason to earn the Gold needed for upgrading your Cargo Box storage limit &#8211; as well as your Air Tank, Harpoon Gun, and more. In turn, this motivates the player for the sushi segments of the game; depending on how well the restaurant performs in the evenings, the more Gold you&#8217;ll earn for upgrades. Both sides of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> continue to ingeniously compliment each other in this way, as success in one helps you in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the sushi segments are rather different from the diving, and this is where my earlier comparison to <em>Coffee Talk</em> comes in. After setting sail to Bancho Sushi, you start by going through a list of your possible dishes to serve in your evening menu; your selection is based upon the fish you&#8217;ve caught and the ingredients you&#8217;ve acquired. The quality and quantity of your haul determines your success, as rarer fish open up more expensive dishes that result in a more lucrative evening. Upon selecting each dish, you can also enhance it if you have enough excess ingredients &#8211; a process given extra visual flair by the wonderful animated cutscenes of Bancho preparing the food. These animations aren&#8217;t limited to just Bancho, and are sprinkled throughout <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, such as when weapons expert Duff upgrades your guns. Each of these sequences has a tongue-in-cheek over-exaggerated tone, and add to the playful charm of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15133" height="360" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif?w=640" width="640" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in Bancho Sushi you can browse and sell your ingredients for quickfire Gold, as well as decorate the restaurant as you see fit, and even hire extra members of staff to help you out. The latter are essential, as over time the restaurant gets busier; once you open the restaurant, you control Dave as he serves dishes and maintains the restaurant, and hiring extra hands to help is key to success. Whether it&#8217;s pouring drinks, dashing around to serve sushi plates, cleaning up, or keeping Bancho well-stocked with sushi, this is a frenetic <em>Overcooked</em>-style part of the game that contrasts well with the diving. It&#8217;s certainly not as layered as the underwater gameplay, but it&#8217;s not supposed to be, and does a successful job at giving the player a break between each dive. Plus, it&#8217;s extremely satisfying to see the profits come in &#8211; which can then be spent on upgrades the next day, when the cycle begins anew&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Just Keep Swimming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this core gameplay loop, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> steadily introduces new characters and locations throughout the seven main story chapters. They&#8217;re an eclectic bunch, each with their own expertise and side quests. Archaeologist Dr. Bacon propels the main story forward; as you dive deeper, you discover much more than just fish, including secret civilizations and bigger ecological threats to the Blue Hole &#8211; the latter of which is tracked by the biologist Ellie, who gives you various collection tasks through the Ecowatcher app. Speaking of which, your progress is mostly tracked via these apps, which are accessed via the efficient menu on Dave&#8217;s smartphone. To give a few examples: you might use the phone to acquire and upgrade weapons (with the help of the aforementioned Duff); you might browse your snaps for photographer Udo; or you might look through your Pokémon-style Marinca collection for Sato, an Ash Ketchum lookalike!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15146" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15153" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15154" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between all these characters and side quests, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> has something for everyone. If you like collecting then you can focus on filling out the Marinca (essentially a Pokédex for fish), if you like the sushi-management side you can focus on optimising your earnings, and if you like exploring then you can focus on the diving. Whichever way you play, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> smartly manages to naturally push the story on regardless &#8211; for example, a character named Otto opens a farm partway into the game, where you can grow crops such as rice. Growing these ingredients helps you to reliably create more valuable dishes in the evening; but to help out Otto and subsequently build up the farm, you need to collect certain items, which requires becoming proficient at the diving. Each element of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> gently motivates the others in this way, and therefore pushes the player to test out every facet of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a side effect of this admirable gameplay variety is that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> occasionally inserts under-baked minigames or quick time events. One instance of this is the cooking competition side missions, where you must gather ingredients for Bancho as you normally would, but upon doing so, you must then engage in first-person cooking challenges. These consist of basic button presses and directional inputs, and feel like a rushed version of either a <em>Cooking Mama</em> or <em>Mario Party</em> minigame. It was the rare moment in <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> where I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15123" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15124" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15127" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15136" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, some of these asides work better than others &#8211; a relatively quick soldering minigame is an enjoyable and brief inclusion, and there&#8217;s a compelling <em>Balatro</em>-style card game, but on the other hand, a one-time stealth sequence is particularly badly designed. These hiccups are rare enough that they don&#8217;t significantly detract from <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, but they were also noticeable enough that I had to mention them in this review. They just feel unnecessary &#8211; it&#8217;s as if <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> felt it had to extend itself beyond the main gameplay loop that it executes so superbly. If anything, the high quality of the core diving-and-sushi-selling gameplay only make the brief diversions more jarring.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Deadly Depths</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the various other side missions and gameplay mechanics, it&#8217;s the diving that&#8217;s understandably the focus of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, and it&#8217;s exceptionally well-balanced. As aforementioned, your initial harpoon is a unique weapon to master &#8211; but Dave can also carry one firearm, either by collecting them underwater or by crafting them beforehand. There&#8217;s a range of weapon types: you might use the Net Gun for catching large swathes of fish, or perhaps the Grenade Launcher for explosive damage, or even (my weapon of choice) the Sniper Rifle for long-range damage. The latter is especially handy when tackling sea life that is aggressive at close range, such as the many sharks patrolling the Blue Hole!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15161" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Dave isn&#8217;t just reeling in small fish. You&#8217;ll soon be fighting not only sharks, but hostile jellyfish, giant squids, and plenty more! Significant story events are often accompanied by a boss fight against a dangerous opponent such as these, introduced with stylish freeze frames reminiscent of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and signifying the stakes of the encounter. Additionally, new areas of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> can be a trial by fire, with enemies that suddenly reduce huge amounts of your oxygen supply (which doubles as a health bar of sorts) with a single hit. However, the challenge rarely felt unfair, and any failed dives were always down to my own mistakes &#8211; and only left me more motivated to improve my aquatic skills or upgrade my gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, as well as your harpoon and firearm, Dave can carry a melee weapon (also used for mining materials) and two pieces of equipment. The latter of these can vary, from battle items such as a proximity mine, to ways of helping Dave in a pinch, such as portable oxygen refills. Most of these can be found underwater, or alternatively, they can be pre-purchased from Cobra in the boat before starting your dive, adding another way for the player to customise their approach. Overall, there&#8217;s a well-judged balance between giving the player plenty of options, but not giving you so much power that you can become complacent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15142" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15172" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15168" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when you feel comfortable with Dave and his toolset, the missions being asked of you often cleverly push you out of your comfort zone &#8211; and if you&#8217;re not careful, it doesn&#8217;t take much for a dangerous enemy or perilous area to derail your dive and leave you back at the boat almost empty-handed. It&#8217;s oh-so-easy to fall into the trap of completing just one more mission, collecting just one more item, capturing just one more fish &#8211; but equally, there&#8217;s an undeniable thrill to escaping just in time. In the later chapters, missions become more specific to match your increased skills, and particular ingredients can necessitate repeated captures of rare creatures. This cycle reminded me of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and similarly to that series, provides a tangible reason to keep capturing the most elusive fish &#8211; in this case, to find the rarest ingredients and compose the finest dishes at Bancho Sushi!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Under the Sea</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the endearing yet adventurous nature of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the graphical style; the gorgeous pixel-art invites you in, making diving a little deeper &#8211; and playing a little longer &#8211; even more enticing. The shallow regions are full of bright welcoming colours, but the variety only builds from here. Every layer under the water has a unique visual identity, such as the dark Blue Hole Depths, or the extreme cold and heat of later areas. Meanwhile, night-time dives feature a shining kaleidoscope of colourful foliage that feels magical to navigate &#8211; when you&#8217;re not being pursued by deadly fish, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15162" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the human character designs have a palpable sense of personality. This gets more spotlight in the earlier-mentioned animated cutscenes, which blend the stunning pixel art with the tongue-in-cheek humour that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> does so well. By the end of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, the roster of characters have a real sense of camaraderie between them, which contributes to that overall warm and relaxed feeling that the game has. Add in the detailed multitude of marine species and food recipes, and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> really is a delectably beautiful game. Playing it on the large handheld screen <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/09/09/did-my-hopes-for-the-switch-2-become-a-reality/">of the Switch 2</a> has only accentuated this feeling further for me &#8211; and it&#8217;s been a great example for how that console helps the back catalogue of the original Switch to shine even brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial compliment to the visuals of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the music, which is often a wonderfully soothing backdrop to your deep sea exploration. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a notably therapeutic game when you’re just casually collecting fish, exploring the vast swathes of water, and listening to the delicate musical backdrop. My favourite piece of music is for a late-game frozen area, where these tranquil tones morph into a synth-style inspirational beat. Also, music fans will get an extra treat from a certain cameo appearance at Bancho Sushi, who comes complete with a musical performance that I’ve been listening to many times since! Not to be glossed over is the sound design, too &#8211; the sounds of marine life, the tense pull of a harpoon, the whooshing of waves, it all sounds authentic and distinct, and pulls you further into the watery world of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15163" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15148" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg?w=863" width="863" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15150" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing about this game &#8211; it reels you in, not necessarily in a sudden way, but a gradual one. As the in-game days go by, you settle more thoroughly into the gameplay loop, getting more familiar with characters old and new, until they become familiar friends on your adventure. There&#8217;s a sense of pleasing routine to checking your farms for crops and ingredients, then going diving and completing missions, before then preparing for the evening Bancho Sushi business. It&#8217;s a lot like the charm of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> or <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but with the added element of gripping underwater gameplay to go alongside it. The game is kept fresh by the steady incline of options and equipment available to Dave, and this creates an endgame with potentially endless longevity. Even when you finish all of the main story missions, you still have a restaurant business to run, and you can continue building it out to your hearts content. There&#8217;s extra DLC too, two of which (the <em>Dredge</em> and <em>Godzilla</em> tie-in packs) are free, for those looking for extra content!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a delight to play through <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. The mix of gripping gameplay and relaxing sushi simulation &#8211; combined with the incredible art direction and music &#8211; makes for an RPG full of endearing charm and well-meaning adventure. At its heart is whimsy and a sense of positivity, and that soaks through into every part of the game &#8211; and each part compliments the other in a wonderfully natural way. My only criticism is that this enthusiasm leads to the introduction of impromptu minigames and quick time events that sometimes feel underdeveloped in contrast to the main diving gameplay &#8211; but they&#8217;re few and far between, and a drop in the ocean compared to the sea of brilliance within <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. There&#8217;s brilliant longevity built in too &#8211; even after finishing the main story, the diving and sushi restaurant aspects remain, for those who&#8217;d like to continue building Bancho Sushi into the best restaurant it can be. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a treasure of a game, and it comes highly recommended from me!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center

This particular Direct was split into three distinct segments: first about the 40th Anniversary of Mario, then news for the original Nintendo Switch, and then finally information on the Switch 2 &#8211; and altogether it made for a barnstorming hour-long performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo has been on a run of brilliant Directs over the last few years, but this might genuinely be my favourite one for a long while. Many of the announcements in this Direct speak specifically to me and the games I have been looking forward to, and it&#8217;s genuinely made whittling my choices down to five a tough task! If you&#8217;d like to see the full Nintendo Direct, you can do so below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Honourable Mentions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of it being a tough task&#8230; With so much packed into the Direct, I am first going to run through some other announcements that I was glad or intrigued to see, but didn&#8217;t make the cut for the five announcements that appealed most to me personally. The Nintendo Direct started with several <em>Mario </em>announcements in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary: this included a trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> in 2026, as well as a collection of both <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> games for Nintendo Switch, coming October 2nd this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retrospectively, this does make <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/04/lets-chat-3d-mario-games-are-coming-to-switch-but-where-is-galaxy-2/">the decision not to include <em>Galaxy 2</em> in the <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> collection</a> feel very calculated. I personally will likely pass on this new release of the <em>Galaxy </em>games, as the £58.99 cost (or £33.99 separately) feels excessive &#8211; and whilst they are superb games, I doubt I&#8217;ll play them enough when there are so many other new games to play. I do, however, hope to get the physical <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOor7cl-qF_B_yaH1ketH1_ep2UqAIeMsULytGxbXaJ-8c79YpmKe">Rosalina&#8217;s Storybook</a> they are making, as that would be lovely to keep in the collection!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15028" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15029" height="377" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg?w=670" width="670" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15027" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15026" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we got a release date of 4th December for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was great to have confirmed &#8211; and the only reason it isn&#8217;t in my main five picks below is that the new footage left me a bit hesitant. We got to see the new bike Samus will use to traverse the world, and there was something off about it &#8211; the world looked a bit too empty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The footage reminded me of the infamous Mako in the first <em>Mass Effect</em> game, which was also known for wide open spaces that felt empty and were awkward to navigate. Visually, the bike is very cool, and the first-person segments look fantastic, but I was surprised at the briefness of this new footage. I sincerely hope that isn&#8217;t a sign of a lack of confidence in the game; either way, eight years after the initial announcement, I remain very excited for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> to finally launch!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I&#8217;d like to give a mention to the <em>Pokémon</em> segment of the Direct. We got the announcement of a brand new spin-off game named <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, which looks like a mix between<em> Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>, where you play as a Ditto-turned-human (whether this is charming or horrific, you decide)! This game probably won&#8217;t be for me, but I envisage it being very popular, by blending life-sim mechanics with the popularity of the world of <em>Pokémon</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, we got more info for the soon-to-be-released <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, showing off new Mega Evolutions; this segment ended with an announcement of the upcoming <em>Mega Dimension</em> paid DLC, and this felt quite cynical &#8211; it feels strange to have paid DLC announced before we even have the base game. I&#8217;ll wait and see how that DLC materialises, but for now, I&#8217;m fine not seeing much more about <em>Z-A</em>, as I&#8217;m definitely purchasing the game at launch. From here, the Direct transitioned into the surprise announcement of <em>Danganronpa 2&#215;2</em>, a new version of <em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> with added content! I only relatively recently finished (<a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/09/danganronpa-2-goodbye-despair-review-an-ambitious-beautiful-mess-of-a-sequel/">and reviewed</a>) the original game on Switch, and I really enjoyed it overall, so I&#8217;ll be curious to see how much difference the additions make.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15020" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15024" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15025" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15022" height="338" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg?w=600" width="600" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That was quite a long honourable mentions section, wasn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a result of just how many exciting announcements we received; I finished this Direct feeling very optimistic about the future of the Switch 2, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten into my top five reason why! When there are so many announcements, writing this sort of article helps me process the Direct and focus in on the games I&#8217;m going to prioritise playing, and I hope it is an enjoyable read for you too! Right, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#5: Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the most exciting part of the <em>Mario </em>section of the Direct was the announcement of a brand new Yoshi game, named <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em>! Yoshi side-scrollers have a reputation for charming art directions &#8211; for example <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Woolly World</em> and <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Crafted World</em> &#8211; and this game continues that, with a gorgeous stop-motion visual style bursting with colour and personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot of the game follows Yoshi after the appearance of a peculiar book named Mr. E, with pages detailing mysterious creatures. Yoshi jumps into the book (which is the reason for the storybook graphical style) and meets various new creatures, with the details jotted down into the book as Yoshi does so. Completing the storybook of fantastical creatures is an accompaniment to the charming platforming, and there&#8217;s a palpable sense of warmth and whimsy to it all. This game looks ideal for playing on a rainy weekend, wrapped up warm and enjoying the cosy gameplay. I see <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>being a brilliant experience for all ages of players, and I look forward to playing it myself when it releases in Spring 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#4: Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Direct contained the announcements of release dates for several high-profile previously-announced games, and three of these appear on my list. Starting this off is <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>, the third <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> game after the original and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/05/15/my-to-play-list-may-2023-progress/">Age of Calamity</a></em>, which is confirmed to release on November 6th. Just as the latter of those filled in story gaps for <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, one of the main appeals of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is adding story details for <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. Specifically, the time period that Princess Zelda is sent back to in that game &#8211; and I&#8217;m glad to see this time covered more thoroughly, as it felt to me that Zelda was unfairly side-lined in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as a release date, the new footage showed off playable characters such as Queen Sonia, King Rauru, and a new unnamed Korok character. The gameplay looks like the expected <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-esque combat, but there are some additions, such as Zonai devices and multi-character Sync Strikes that change depending on the character combinations. There&#8217;s also the confirmation of local GameShare multiplayer and splitscreen, and glimpses of many epic visual sequences such as airborne Gleeok battles. I accept that the gameplay will likely be repetitive, but for me the appeal of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games is the visual spectacle and extra lore &#8211; and<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> looks to be delivering on that!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#3: Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the brand new announcements of the Direct was that of a new mainline <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, named <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em>. It&#8217;s been wonderful to see <em>Fire Emblem</em> gradually become a household name in the West, with the 3DS games such as <em>Awakening</em> laying the groundwork for <em>Three Houses</em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/14/a-little-zelda-a-lotta-farming-takeaways-from-the-nintendo-direct/">Engage</a> </em>to be massive hits on Switch. The distinction setting <em>Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart is the gladiator-style Heroic Games, which has a multitude of characters competing for the fulfilled wishes that supposedly reward your victory. At the end of the trailer, we see a tease of Sothis, a character from Three Houses &#8211; so it appears there may be a story connection to that game as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the game looks stunning, with gorgeous anime visuals, and clean turn-based strategy UI design. Part of the appeal of <em>Fire Emblem</em> is the stakes of building character relationships in a world where permadeath is possible, and the gladiatorial setting will hopefully provide a fresh twist to that structure that will set<em> Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart. The trailer has a variety of striking characters, and I&#8217;m looking forward to finding my favourites! For now, we only have a general 2026 release date, so I&#8217;d guess that this game will be one of the major late-year releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#2: Resident Evil: Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think it surprising that I&#8217;ve put two already-announced games above the news of a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game; but that&#8217;s a reflection of my adoration for the franchises these next two games are a part of, and how stoked I am to see additional news about their next instalments. Firstly we have <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, the much-anticipated ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> game (if you don&#8217;t count <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/27/resident-evil-zero-review/"><em>Resident Evil Zero</em></a>). This latest entry stars FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she pursues the truth about a deadly virus and the mystery of her mother&#8217;s death &#8211; a path which leads her to the ruins of Raccoon City. This game had already been announced for other consoles, but this is the formal announcement of a Switch 2 version, which is brilliant to see. On Switch, <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/11/25/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/16/resident-evil-village-review/">Resident Evil Village</a></em> could only be played as Cloud games, but the more conventional release of <em>Requiem </em>shows that the console can (for now, at least) keep up with modern large-scale third-party releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually might play <em>Requiem </em>on Switch 2 &#8211; my only other means would be PC or Xbox Series S, and as someone who likes to collect physical copies of <em>Resident Evil</em> games on console, that makes the Switch 2 version more appealing to me. <em>Requiem </em>is up there as one of my most anticipated games; I adore the <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise, and am eagerly awaiting <em>Requiem</em> to see how they interweave the lore of the series into the story. Other than Chris Redfield, we haven&#8217;t had any of the earlier characters show up in the main series since <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, and with the return to Raccoon City, this feels like an ideal time for some guest appearances of older, more experienced versions of those fan favourites. Grace Ashcroft is also the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character from the lesser-known spin-off <em>Resident Evil Outbreak</em> games, which already shows that Capcom is happy playing with some deep-cut lore. I happen to have bought the two <em>Outbreak</em> games second-hand before <em>Requiem</em> was even announced, and am planning to play them before the launch of <em>Requiem </em>and write up my thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Requiem </em>trailer in the Direct was full of intense visuals, threatening figures, and story hints (such as the iconic Umbrella Corporation logo). It struck me that there&#8217;s an underlying grungy tone waiting to break out, which I&#8217;m very excited to discover. This can even be seen in the logo for <em>Requiem</em>, and the burned-out profile shot of Grace near the end of this new trailer. Right now, the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise is in a very healthy place (as healthy a a series about viral monstrosities can be, anyway), and it&#8217;s given Capcom a resulting confidence that could make this game utterly exceptional. They&#8217;re playing their cards close to their chest, concealing the full extent of the horrors that await us on February 27th&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#1: Hades II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yes, oh yes. This is an announcement fans of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/14/hades-review/">Hades</a></em> and Supergiant Games have been awaiting since the reveal of <em>Hades II</em> back at The Game Awards in 2022, and now it&#8217;s here &#8211; the release date of the official 1.0 version, releasing digitally on Switch and PC on September 25th (and physically on November 20th). The first <em>Hades</em> is a phenomenal roguelike action game that turned many players into fans of the genre, but it was quite a surprise when Supergiant announced a sequel &#8211; not only was the first game utterly jam-packed with content and ideas, but they&#8217;d never done a sequel game before. I&#8217;ve purposefully been avoiding details about the game in Early Access, as I&#8217;d like to go in fresh and see what marvels Supergiant have cooked up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon this could be a <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>/<em>Galaxy 2</em> situation, where the developers have so many ideas and so much creativity to share, that they need a whole other game to fit it all in. This time, we play as the immortal Princess of the Underworld, battling against the Titan of Time and exploring an even larger and deeper mythic world of Olympian Gods. In the Direct, this was visualized with a cutscene that gave me goosebumps from the visual flair on show; Supergiant are known for their sumptuous visuals and music, and that&#8217;s very much still the case here. I&#8217;m eager to dive back into the rich gameplay and gripping story of the world of <em>Hades</em>, reuniting with previous characters (Artemis is back!) and meeting new ones. I honestly didn&#8217;t expect the release date to be so soon, but in less than two weeks we&#8217;ll be able to play the 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> &#8211; discovering new Boons, enemies, locations, and more. Bring it on!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>This Nintendo Direct was sensational, and answered many questions about release dates and upcoming games for the Switch 2 (and Switch) release slate. I&#8217;ve been enjoying my gaming a lot recently, and this Direct has only fuelled that passion more &#8211; the only problem is going to be finding the time to play all these games! Speaking of which, I&#8217;m off to play some of those said games! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks so much for reading, I really appreciate it.

It&#8217;s been roughly a year and a half since I wrote that post, and the Switch 2 has been out for just over three months &#8211; so we now have comprehensive knowledge of what the system offers. With the Switch 2, Nintendo took the wise (and safe) approach, capitalising on the continued popularity of the Switch brand and not changing things too drastically. The console is more of an iteration rather than a revolution, but it certainly makes significant changes and upgrades in certain areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had some time with the Switch 2, I thought it&#8217;d be a suitable moment to take a look back at my aforementioned post about my hopes for the console, run one-by-one through the list, and talk about which became a reality (and which didn&#8217;t). Then, at the end of the post, I&#8217;ll summarise my current personal opinions on the Switch 2, taking these results into account. Right then, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Optimize the eShop: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My foremost request was to improve the eShop, which was struggling on multiple fronts on the original Switch: the sheer volume of releases made discoverability of games difficult; there was a lack of quality control; and the user interface was susceptible to noticeable lag. In my opinion, this was one of the most important areas for Nintendo to improve upon &#8211; it might seem less flashy than other aspects, but improving the process of finding new digital games is an underrated key aspect of a modern console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To start on a positive note, I&#8217;m pleased with the way Nintendo has improved the responsiveness of the eShop. I immediately noticed how much quicker and easier it is to navigate the store &#8211; gone are the painful moments waiting for the eShop to catch up with your inputs. Whether this is down to the increased hardware power, general eShop optimisation, or both, it improves the experience of browsing through the available games, and encourages curiosity as a result. In my book, that boost to game discoverability is a win for both the player and the developers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, whilst Nintendo has bolstered the options on the eShop main menu, it&#8217;s not as extensively as I&#8217;d hoped. Most of the options &#8211; such as the Search, Current Offers, and Coming Soon &#8211; are the same, and the only brand new addition is the For You tab, which recommends games based on your own gameplay trends. I was really hoping for some other additions, or even a review system so that players could help to recommend games for others. As it is, the eShop still has the problem of a constant inundation of new games &#8211; and whilst the Popular New Releases sub-section is a step in the right direction, any game that doesn&#8217;t qualify for this (or the Highlights tab) will get very limited time to grab player attention before the spotlight is taken by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14942" height="645" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14940" height="639" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14938" height="624" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14941" height="598" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of quality control, I reserve full judgement until more time has passed, but it seems that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t changed their approach. Lots of cheap-looking games are still flooding the eShop, and there are still Hentai games appearing relatively frequently. From my perspective, Nintendo could still do with raising the bar of entry, in order to curate a higher level of overall quality across the eShop. The current influx of these low-quality games worsens the issue of discoverability for other titles, which get mired amidst them despite taking much more time and effort to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the steps I&#8217;d still like to see taken for more eShop filtering options and better quality control, Nintendo has still significantly improved the eShop, especially in terms of responsiveness. Therefore, I mark this section as a success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More Power: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is that age-old request for new consoles &#8211; that they have more power, and are able to present games in higher framerates and resolutions. Since the Wii/DS era, Nintendo has rarely (if ever) been known as the technical powerhouse, with art direction, creative hardware, and recognizable IP being more important for bringing in players. That said, the Switch 2 is a big step up from the original Switch, with Nvidia claiming that it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nvidia-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">&#8220;10 times the graphical performance&#8221;</a> of the previous console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a technical expert, so I look for comparisons to other consoles to get a handle on where the Switch 2 lands power-wise. The general perception seems to be that at peak performance, docked on a TV, the Switch 2 is comparable to a PlayStation 4 Pro, but still behind the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles &#8211; which essentially matches my prediction back in March 2024. When played in handheld mode, the system is closer to a base PlayStation 4, but that is compensated for by the smaller screen, which often makes games look crisper to the eye (at least for me).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a hybrid system with a handheld option, battery life is another crucial factor to consider, and the increased performance does appear to have hurt the Switch 2 in this area. You generally get around two-three hours when playing any sort of intensive game, which can feel quite short. However, most of the time I don&#8217;t see this being an issue, unless I am on a very long journey &#8211; and it&#8217;s rare not to have a nearby place to plug in and charge. Whilst that isn&#8217;t an excuse, I prefer Nintendo providing stronger hardware and a shorter battery life rather than the opposite, so I&#8217;m still satisfied on this front. For example, I&#8217;m playing <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/09/17/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-14-09-23/">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em> at the moment, and occasionally having to charge the console is a small price to pay for how well it plays and looks in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14949" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14946" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14947" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14948" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When playing in handheld mode, the screen really is stunning; the increased size and power makes games look incredible, and it makes playing in bed (or wherever you prefer) feel like a luxury. The vibrancy and sharpness of the screen &#8211; especially when held close up for handheld gaming &#8211; gave me that new-generation-upgrade feeling that I was looking for. I&#8217;ve heard some disappointment that Nintendo didn&#8217;t use an OLED screen, but in my opinion the LCD screen is more than sufficient, and if it helps keep costs down then that&#8217;s a reasonable trade. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll get an OLED version of the Switch 2 (like for the original Switch) at some point too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only Switch 2-exclusive game I&#8217;ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em> (you can <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/10/mario-kart-world-review-a-stunning-racer-that-misses-a-few-tricks/">read my review here</a>), and as well as being a fantastic game, it doubles as an excellent technical showcase for the Switch 2. Played in 4K HDR on my TV, it looks sensational. The game moves with a crisp fluidity, and the environment feels palpably full of detail and colour. It was upon playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> that it really dawned on me that the Switch 2 was a major &#8211; and timely &#8211; graphical update on its predecessor, allowing it to keep fair pace with the technical state of gaming.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14934" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>All that graphical performance is needed to do justice to the beauty of Cow</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>All in all, whilst my test case for the Switch 2 is relatively limited for now (I haven&#8217;t played upgraded Switch games like <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em> yet either), I&#8217;m confident that the Switch 2 has delivered on the level of power I personally need in a Nintendo console. I don&#8217;t need it to be top-of-the-range; as long as the system is powerful enough to realise the trademark visual flair of first-party Nintendo games, and is able to house a strong line-up of new third-party releases, then that&#8217;s plenty for me. I eagerly await seeing what Nintendo can magic up with their bespoke Switch 2 games in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Clarity on Games: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads nicely into my next point, on the topic of the Switch 2 software line-up now and into the future. A console is defined by the games on it &#8211; and there were two particular games I was waiting for news on when I wrote that original post in March 2024. These were <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> and also the next Nintendo EAD game, which I predicted would be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game in the vein of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. We have received news on both of these games, even if the latter wasn&#8217;t quite the game I expected, as it has instead materialised as <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14932" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I am loving the vibrant purples in this art, by the way</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about <em>Metroid</em>. The development path of the long-awaited <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> has been turbulent, to say the least &#8211; after being announced back in 2017, Nintendo then publicly announced that they were restarting development in 2019, with Retro Studios (the developers of the original <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em>) coming back on board. When I wrote my post about my hopes for the Switch 2, we were still awaiting news on Metroid &#8211; but roughly three months later <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/06/19/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-18-06-2024/">in the June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, Nintendo finally showed us an announcement trailer for the newly-titled <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That initial trailer gave us a taste of the returning first-person <em>Metroid</em> gameplay and a glimpse of returning enemy Sylux, which kept fans occupied until February 2025, when it was announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM&amp;t=1631s">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> that <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> would be a cross-generation title on both Switch and Switch 2. Whilst unsurprising, this was welcome news &#8211; and roughly a month later in March, we got another Nintendo Direct trailer (see below), showing off more of the game and giving us a 2025 release date. This was followed up by an extensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9xes7BZto">Nintendo Treehouse video</a> in April, continuing the steady stream of new information on the game. However, as we enter September, we&#8217;re awaiting news on a precise release date, and I hope we hear more soon. Even if the game has to be pushed into 2026, I wouldn&#8217;t mind &#8211; after so long waiting, I&#8217;d prefer to wait a little longer if it means a better experience. What&#8217;s another few months after eight years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be fascinating to see the comparison between the Switch 2 and Switch editions of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>; the enhanced Switch 2 edition will have Joy-Con 2 mouse controls as well as support for 4K, HDR, and 120 fps! After seeing how brilliant <em>Mario Kart World</em> looks, I&#8217;m excited to experience a new <em>Metroid</em> adventure in these formats &#8211; I have a feeling the game will look sensational. So far, it appears that the game isn&#8217;t straying too far from the gameplay of previous <em>Prime </em>games, and instead refining the first-person formula, with some added tricks such as Psychic Abilities for Samus. I&#8217;m especially intrigued to see where the story goes, and am avoiding too many plot details until release!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, I thought <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was the more outlandish of the two games I was anticipating back in March 2024, as I was confident that a new 3D <em>Mario </em>from Nintendo EAD would be announced. I was both right and wrong &#8211; whilst we haven&#8217;t received a 3D <em>Mario </em>per se, we have gotten a new <em>Mario</em>-adjacent Nintendo EAD 3D game, in the form of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! This was the closing reveal in the Switch 2 Direct back in April; but it wasn&#8217;t until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Direct</a> in June that it was announced this isn&#8217;t just a Donkey Kong game, but a Pauline game as well, with a younger version of the character joining DK on his travels!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo EAD have an amazing track record, and the glowing critical reception to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>has been a continuation of this, praising the sheer gameplay creativity and enjoyment. One of the key features is the ability for Donkey Kong to smash through the environment, reshaping and even creating tunnels through it! The game released on 17th July, and I haven&#8217;t actually played it yet, as I haven&#8217;t found the time to justify spending the money on it. But now <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/">that I&#8217;ve finished the Pokémon League in <em>Pokémon Diamond</em></a> and am taking a break from that, I&#8217;ll hopefully soon get around to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, my next definite Switch 2 purchase will be <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, and I&#8217;m very tempted to get <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> too! There&#8217;s also the question about how series such as <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/10/25/where-can-zelda-go-after-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> might manifest on Switch 2, but I&#8217;m happy having patience &#8211; there are already so many other amazing games to play in the meantime!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More System Customization: No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, here we come to the first of my hopes that didn&#8217;t become a reality. The original Switch only allowed very simple customisation of the Home screen, and Switch 2 hasn&#8217;t evolved this at all, still only allowing two Themes: Basic White and Basic Black (my console is set to the latter). Having a Themes menu suggests the idea of having more options, but I&#8217;m not full of confidence, as we haven&#8217;t received any extra options since the original Switch launch in 2017.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14926" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I like neutral colours, but the option to add more flair could be fun</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not a software developer, it feels like Nintendo is missing an open goal by not allowing us to have Themes based on franchises such as <em>Mario</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, or <em>Metroid</em> &#8211; I honestly think people would even spend a small amount on these, in order to add vibrant new visuals to their systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that Nintendo could still add options in the future, but it&#8217;s disappointing that for now there&#8217;s no word on this. In my March 2024 post, I suggested extra options such as the <em>Nintendo Badge Arcade</em> sticker system on 3DS, but now I feel as if I need to keep expectations in check. At this point, even a couple extra Themes would be great to see.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14928" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Themes menu even seems designed to hold more options</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As on the original Switch, the main way of showing personality is through your profile icon. Nintendo has added extra customisation options over time, particularly via the Nintendo Switch Online menu, where you can unlock new characters, backgrounds, and frames for your profile icon. Whilst it&#8217;s a mostly unchanged process from the Switch, I&#8217;m glad this bit of customisation is still present. I imagine it won&#8217;t be too long until we get more Joy-Con 2 colours, so at least there should soon be that avenue for customising the look of your console (if you have the expendable income). Considering how popular the Switch 2 is, it&#8217;d be wonderful to see more done on the digital side to allow players to show their personality. I hope we see developments in this area in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Enhanced Social Features: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth and final entry on this list regards the social aspects of the Switch &#8211; in my original post, this was primarily about having improved voice chat functions, and thankfully, this is the main social aspect where the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade! After years (and multiple console generations) of players asking, Nintendo has finally added an in-built party voice chat to the Switch 2, named GameChat. It&#8217;s now possible to talk to your registered friends over the internet, using the in-built microphone in the Switch (and Camera, if purchased), even if they are playing different software. Whilst it isn&#8217;t revolutionary &#8211; after all, other consoles have had similar systems for a long time &#8211; it&#8217;s a welcome addition that I&#8217;m very happy to see Nintendo include for the Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous Nintendo consoles have had forms of voice chat, but they always had some sort of catch &#8211; for example on the Switch, where voice chat was tied to the Switch Online mobile app. So, it&#8217;s great to see Nintendo introduce a more complete and in-built offering &#8211; if anything, I feel a bit bad, because I doubt I&#8217;ll use it much. As the years have passed, I&#8217;ve gotten used to using Discord as an alternative form of online chat when playing Nintendo games, because it&#8217;s been more convenient &#8211; and I think it&#8217;ll be hard to break out of that routine. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m very glad GameChat has been added for the Switch 2, and I commend Nintendo for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I hoped to see some sort of extensive social hub added, along the lines of Miiverse or StreetPass. The closest is the Nintendo Switch App, which has new functionality such as uploading screenshots, receiving GameChat notifications, and (most intriguingly) interacting with games such as <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (see the images below). But I miss the in-built communal aspects of previous systems, as they brought people together without as much push towards a mobile app. We still have the News channels to get specific updates on the topics and games you choose to follow, but these are mostly one-way interactions. Nintendo has done well in previous generations at creating unique spaces for players to help shape the multiplayer culture of their consoles, but Switch and Switch 2 feel a bit more controlled in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14922" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14921" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14923" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another aspect that the Switch 2 still lacks is an equivalent to Achievements or Trophies. This is something I used to think was a glaring omission, as it would be a great extra motivation to 100% games such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/04/30/lets-chat-a-long-overdue-super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>. But <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/16/why-ive-stopped-caring-so-much-about-achievements-trophies/">as years have gone by</a>, I have gained respect for Nintendo not having this sort of system, whether it be by conscious decision or simply a lack of intention to do so. There&#8217;s something freeing about playing games on the Switch, and indeed, the Switch 2 &#8211; there&#8217;s a lack of TV/streaming apps, or completion-style Achievement/Trophy systems, and instead the focus is all on the act of playing games. That laser-focus is really refreshing, and I&#8217;m not clamouring for those additions at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, whilst I&#8217;d like to see an expansion into a more communal gaming hub in the future, the Switch 2 definitely delivered on my hope for enhanced social features. The addition of GameChat is one of the major upgrades for the Switch 2, and a lot of marketing and development focus went into it, which shows Nintendo listened to player requests for this type of addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After going through those five points, how has the Switch 2 fared when it comes to my personal hopes for the console? Four of my five points were met to some degree of success, which I mark as a win overall. Evidently, Nintendo recognised the general areas where improvements could be made &#8211; and whilst not all of them were as emphatic an upgrade as I may have hoped, the cumulative progress makes for a significant leap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarise, I&#8217;m going to rattle back through the main points. Firstly, the eShop is much easier and faster to navigate, but could still do with more options for filters and user reviews. In addition, the console is a step up in power, and whilst it isn&#8217;t at the level of modern Microsoft and Sony consoles, games look brilliant and the hardware keeps Nintendo in the ballpark for third-party games. Speaking of which, we have received welcome news on <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, and seen the release of a new exciting Nintendo EAD game in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, and now we wait for the likes of <em>Pokémon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and other franchises to launch on the console. Sadly, Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added much in the way of system customization, but it has delivered new social options in the form of GameChat, finally bringing in-built party chat to a Nintendo console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the admitted caveats to some of the &#8220;Yes&#8221; points, I want to focus on the positives of the Switch 2. This is because, despite the iterative nature of the console, it does achieve that new-console feel. I was worried that it might feel like another specification of Switch instead of a brand new thing, but there are enough upgrades to ensure that isn&#8217;t the case. Much of this is down to the optimized power of the console, and how much snappier and responsive it is to play. But another contributing factor is the hardware itself &#8211; in handheld mode, the larger form factor and sleeker Joy-Con 2 designs feels fresh and streamlined, and the console has made playing in bed (for example) feel like a delightful high-end experience. I will say, it helps that I have massive hands, so the larger console size is more comfortable for me personally.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14952" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d like to see Nintendo continue to make software improvements to the Switch 2 &#8211; for example new eShop features, new menu Themes, and extra social hubs &#8211; but I&#8217;m left with a firmly positive impression of the console overall. I&#8217;ve been getting back into playing games more frequently recently, and I&#8217;m glad to say that the Switch 2 has been a contributing factor to that; and if I&#8217;m playing more games and having a good time doing so, that marks the Switch 2 as a success in my book!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this post! There are lots of Switch 2 reviews and reactions around the internet, so I hope this before-and-after approach was a personal, distinct, and enjoyable differentiation.

As mentioned in that post, I was part-way through my first ever play through of <em>Diamond </em>at the time of writing. Of the two initial games (<em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>), <em>Pearl </em>was the one I got back in 2007, before then playing the third game <em>Platinum </em>when it released in 2009. I’ve kept my <em>Pearl </em>save to this day, whilst <em>Platinum </em>became the game I’d restart whenever I went back to play through Sinnoh &#8211; especially as it has extra content and various quality-of-life refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I hadn’t ever played <em>Diamond </em>until I felt compelled to buy myself a copy for £48.49 from GAME back in 2019. After all, <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>are second only to <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/07/11/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> in terms of my favourite games ever, so it’s lovely to have the complete set of three physical games. I’ve been gradually playing through <em>Diamond </em>ever since; in that aforementioned 2023 post, I noted that I’d reached the trek to Snowpoint City, roughly two-thirds of the way through the game. Since then, I&#8217;ve played a little bit more each year, finishing the villainous Team Galactic part of the main story, catching the cover Legendary Pokemon Dialga, and now preparing to tackle the Pokémon League!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-12 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14830" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14828" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14829" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14806" height="715" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve played through the Sinnoh-based <em>Pokémon</em> games, and the adventure feels a little different every time, for multiple reasons: , it might be the <em>Pokémon</em> team I choose, the approach I take, or how I’m feeling in my personal life at the time. With this being my first time playing <em>Diamond</em>, it&#8217;s felt unique once again &#8211; and as I gradually get ready to reach the end of the game (and start the postgame), I thought it’d be a nice point at which to write a journal-style post about the playthrough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, this journal approach matches my new writing method I’ve been testing, where I write a little bit every day, even if it’s just a paragraph or two. It’s helped me start posting at a more regular cadence recently, which I’ve really enjoyed, and am hoping to continue! I hope you’ll come with me on my retro-inspired ramble about my current adventuring in Sinnoh, and my plan to defeat the Pokémon League with a team that might be described as unconventional&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Shine Bright Like A&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this playthrough of <em>Diamond</em>, I decided not to create my character as “William”. I often style my avatar as myself on my first playthrough of a <em>Pokémon</em> game; but as I&#8217;ve played through Sinnoh many times before, I instead went for the approach I use on repeated playthroughs. In these situations, I like to create a new character persona, in a way that challenges my team selection, mixes up the gameplay, and allows me to add my own imaginary lore. Over the years, this has often led to me constructing a monotype team (usually Steel, my favourite type), but this time I went for a dichotomy theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14797" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14795" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The character I created is called Lucie, and I think of her as treading the line between both fiery and subdued personalities. Her starter is Chimchar, which will evolve into Infernape, one of the infamously few Fire type Pokémon in the core region of Sinnoh in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em> (the Elite Four member Flint has just two Fire types in their Fire-type team)! Two of the team slots are filled by a pair of Gastrodons (named Gianna and Gillian), a Pokémon which has two forms in Sinnoh: the pink West Sea Gastrodon, and the blue East Sea Gastrodon. By having one of each, it plays into that duality theming; I think of the pink Gastrodon as part of the &#8220;bright&#8221;, flamboyant side of the team, whilst the blue Gastrodon represents the &#8220;nocturnal&#8221;, subtler side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining the West Sea Gastrodon side of the team, we have the blazing Infernape (named Symphony), as well as Raichu (Ryland) and their electrifying moves. These Pokémon both deliver fast, strong damage: for example, Close Combat and Flare Blitz for Infernape, and Thunderbolt for Raichu. On the East Sea Gastrodon side is Noctowl (Miles), which has helpful status moves such as the sleep-inducing Hypnosis, as well as Skuntank (Skylah), which has Toxic for poisoning opponents and whittling them down. As you can probably tell, I&#8217;ve always liked to daydream up my own head canon for the characters and adventure. It helps every playthrough to feel unique, as if I&#8217;m adding extra world-building along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-14 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14793" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14791" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14787" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14788" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14790" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14789" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the team described above certainly isn&#8217;t the strongest possible for <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>&#8211; and I&#8217;m aware I&#8217;m making my life more difficult when it comes to battling the toughest trainers, such as the upcoming Elite Four and Champion Cynthia. But some of these Pokémon (especially Gastrodon, Nowtowl, and Skuntank) are Pokémon I&#8217;ve barely played with before, so I get to experience the challenge of Sinnoh in a brand new way! Mixing up the team helps every playthrough to feel fresh, and strengthens my personal connection with the team &#8211; not just now, but also when I look back on them years later, such as in a longevity app like <em>Pokémon HOME</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">A Girl&#8217;s Best Friend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;ve just finished working through Victory Road, reached the entrance to the Pokémon League, and completed the final fight against your in-game rival (on a whim, I named them Mervin). Relative to other games in the series, I&#8217;d argue that Sinnoh has the best Pokémon League &#8211; the members all have distinct personalities, and present a well-balanced challenge. The difficulty isn&#8217;t unfair, but requires you to take the League seriously; I&#8217;m currently in the phase of backtracking, training up the levels of my Pokémon, and refining the movesets, items, and strategies I&#8217;m going to approach the League with. With the team I&#8217;ve selected, it requires being very deliberate with my choices &#8211; of course, the main advantage I have is that I&#8217;m particularly familiar with the challenge that lies ahead, and can plan accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-15 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14817" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14811" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14821" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14820" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14818" height="168" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216" width="216" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14799" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sinnoh Pokémon League starts with the Bug-type trainer Aaron, who should be the easiest to defeat &#8211; Bug-types have many type weaknesses, such as to Fire and Flying, which my Infernape and Noctowl can target respectively. Next up will be Bertha and her Ground-type team, which will be a tougher test &#8211; the plethora of Ground attacks will be dangerous for Infernape and Raichu, so my two Gastrodons will be relied upon to use their Water-type moves. Noctowl has a useful immunity to Ground, and Skuntank can help out with Toxic, so my team has a decent amount of options for this battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is Flint, who as mentioned earlier, is a Fire-type trainer that curiously has three non-Fire types on their team. The two that are there &#8211; Rapidash and Infernape &#8211; should again struggle against the two Gastrodons, and then the rest of my team should be able to wear down Steelix, Drifblim, and Lopunny without too much issue. Then we&#8217;ll come to Lucian, the final member of the Elite Four, who has a Psychic-type team &#8211; and this is where Skuntank will have their turn taking centre stage, as their Dark typing makes them immune to Psychic moves. With the use of Night Slash (which has an elevated critical hit rate, boosted further by the equipped Razor Claw), Skuntank should carve through a lot of the opponents, with the help of Infernape to tackle the Steel typing of Bronzong.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-16 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14808" height="542" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721" width="721" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14810" height="548" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727" width="727" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing this plan out, it makes me fairly confident at defeating the Elite Four without too much trouble. However, players of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>know that the toughest challenge lies with Champion Cynthia and her excellent team of strong and varied Pokémon (which even includes a Gastrodon of her own)! The biggest threat is her ace Pokémon &#8211; Garchomp &#8211; which can likely take out most of my team with one hit from an Earthquake. My best options are going to be my two Gastrodons, which have strong defensive stats, and can use Blizzard and Ice Beam to hit the double Ice weakness of Garchomp. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll rely on Noctowl and Hypnosis, to give myself some more time. It&#8217;s going to be a nervy battle, but there are routes to success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">In Reflection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage of the game, where I&#8217;m backtracking and gradually training up my Pokémon, showcases some of why I adore <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>so much. In theory, this part could be tiresome, gradually grinding through the experience points needed to make my team stronger &#8211; but instead, I find it tranquil. There&#8217;s something magical about the way music, visuals, and gameplay combine in these games specifically, and I enjoy taking my time; one of the main places I&#8217;m training is Victory Road, as I can access a variety of strong wild Pokémon there. Near the entrance is a useful Pokémon Center for healing your team, and I often pause to listen to the &#8220;Pokémon League&#8221; music that plays outside it. This particular track has both &#8220;Day&#8221; and &#8220;Night&#8221; versions, and the latter is especially beautiful (you can listen below). It&#8217;s a beautifully delicate composition, and captures the feeling of being near the end of an amazing adventure, but with so much still left to enjoy, and no need to rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to this music is just one example of the catharsis I feel when playing <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, which is something I talked about back in my 2023 post. This sentiment comes from a place of both subjectivity and objectivity, as my emotional connection to these games is incredibly strong. After my older sister passed away in 2007, I spent hundreds of hours exploring Sinnoh, and I&#8217;m forever grateful to the soothing effect they had &#8211; and still have &#8211; on me. There are many positive aspects I associate with this: the meticulous sprite artwork and colour palette; the endearing Pokémon and character designs; the region full of secrets to explore; the sprawling Underground; and that amazing soundtrack, just to name a handful of reasons why I love these games so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I prepare to enter the Pokémon League, I&#8217;ve also started thinking about the postgame, which in <em>Diamond </em>includes a whole separate island northeast of Sinnoh, named the Battle Zone (see the map below). It includes the Fight Area, Resort Area, and Survival Area, plus Stark Mountain. The Fight Area includes the Battle Tower in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>, which is less extensive than the expanded Battle Frontier in <em>Platinum</em>, but still offers plenty of challenge and longevity. I love the sheer amount of space left to discover in the postgame; this island is like an extra enclosed region to explore. Currently, I&#8217;m undecided on whether I&#8217;ll dive straight into this after the Pokémon League, or take a break and come back at a later time.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14813" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I&#8217;m well acquainted with the celebratory feel of the Battle Zone island, and may well get drawn into playing it immediately! After the high of defeating the Pokémon League, it&#8217;s wonderful to realise there&#8217;s still so much left for your Pokémon and you to explore. The Battle Zone has a vacation vibe, especially as you initially take a ship to get there &#8211; and the music is also uplifting and energetic, for example Route 225, which feels like a burst of energy, complete with the iconic clapping (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQvx9STW1V0">go to 00:42 in this video</a>)! Overall, the Battle Zone has a celebratory feel, and adds a lot to the overall package of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. I&#8217;m excited for the character of Lucie to extend her adventure, and take her dual-themed team onwards and upwards!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Space and Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope with this post is that it shone a light on two things: the reasons that set this playthrough of <em>Diamond </em>apart, and more detail on why I have such a strong connection to <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. They are such special games to me personally, and for a long time, I&#8217;ve considered how to do that connection justice on this site. The 2023 post was a very cathartic one for me to write, and this post is an extension of that. It&#8217;s amazing how our personal circumstances can affect our thoughts on games (and other forms of media) &#8211; and I love hearing about these stories from other people too, as it often sparks positive discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14850" height="514" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827" width="827" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that down the line, I get to write another post about <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, talking about how the character of Lucie faced the Pokémon League, and then ventured into the postgame and Battle Zone. Down the line, I&#8217;ll likely inevitably play <em>Pokémon Platinum</em> again, and that&#8217;ll continue to be the game I go back to for replaying Sinnoh. For now though, I&#8217;m glad to have completed my physical set of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>games, and to be nearing the final stages of <em>Diamond</em>, with plenty of gameplay hours still ahead to look forward to!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for reading, I sincerely appreciate it. I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a brilliant day!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-featured-2.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-featured-2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827', 'medium': 'image'}]}

This is the first brand new <em>Mario Kart</em> on consoles since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> on Wii U back in 2014 (the Switch received an upgraded version, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, in 2017, which I skipped) &#8211; so at least for me personally, it&#8217;s felt a long time coming. Mixed in with the excitement of a brand new Nintendo console, it made the launch of <em>Mario Kart World</em> feel like a real event, especially when played with friends, which is where <em>Mario Kart</em> always excels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, in various different configurations: both on the TV and in handheld, in solo, local co-op, and online with a friend. Now, I&#8217;ve reached a point where I feel I can state a comprehensive opinion on the game, having experienced both the racing modes and the open world that&#8217;s a major selling point of this iteration of <em>Mario Kart</em>. My thoughts are overall very positive, but there are also some flawed aspects to the game  &#8211; but I&#8217;ll expand upon this more later on in the review. Without further ado then, let&#8217;s get into it!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Start Your Engines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it was the new-console glow, or perhaps it was that wait since <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, but launching into <em>Mario Kart World</em> for the first time felt distinctly special. The game encourages you straight into exploring the open world first; this consists of the various tracks connected by open spaces of road, field, water, desert, and more. What&#8217;s immediately remarkable about the game is just how gorgeous it looks, both in handheld but also especially when played on a 4K HDR TV &#8211; and whilst this isn&#8217;t new technology, it&#8217;s wonderful to play Nintendo games in such high fidelity via the Switch 2. The visual direction of <em>Mario Kart World</em> makes brilliant use of the new hardware, presenting a world full of vibrancy, colour, and personality &#8211; which is shown in the track designs, whether it&#8217;s the bustling Shy Guy Bazaar, the scrumptious Sky-High Sundae, or the fiery Bowser&#8217;s Castle, just to name three!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-17 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14727" height="574" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mkw_sgb_view.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14724" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14725" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_17.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The infused personality is evident in the roster of characters (complete with various different unlockable outfits). Returning are your usual suspects like Mario, Luigi, Peach, and so forth; additionally, there are plenty of newcomers, including minor enemies such as Konkdor and Cataquack, and even bit-part characters such as Dolphin and, of course, Cow! If you&#8217;ve seen any discourse about <em>Mario Kart World</em> since the initial announcement, you&#8217;ll know that the Cow and their adorable grin has captured the attention of the internet, and I&#8217;ve had a wonderful time watching the various memes and edits their inclusion has spawned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the characters have a range of changeable outfits too, which are unlocked by collecting Dash Food bags from vendors in races or the open world. It adds an extra way to differentiate the characters, ranging from punk rock biker looks to desert outfits and much more in between &#8211; and they can be combined with the plentiful different karts and bikes to create the aesthetic you&#8217;re looking for. A Photo Mode has been added in tandem with this, giving plentiful options for taking pictures that show off the world and characters as you see fit. Me being me, I&#8217;m sad that we got an Explorer outfit Toad but no actual Captain Toad&#8230; But there&#8217;s always time for that in DLC, hopefully!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14754" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A smorgasbord of Yoshi! Or Yoshis? Yoshies?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The attention to detail in both audio and graphic effects is especially apparent when you build up speed. Karts and bikes camber side-to-side when they hop and drift; tyres are spongey and visibly bounce and recoil according to the track surface; and sparks crackle off your vehicle as you drift and build up a boost, just to name a small handful of the details I&#8217;m talking about. I particularly like the tension of drifting around the sharpest corners, with the screen often tilting with you and making it extra satisfying to hit the apex. Plus, the music is noticeably exceptional, supplying a consistently energetic chorus that accentuates the gameplay &#8211; especially in the final unlockable tracks, which supply a climactic crescendo unlike any other I&#8217;ve experienced in <em>Mario Kart</em>. Overall, the whole experience is lifted by this pristine look and feel, whether it&#8217;s the relatively laid-back open world, or the competitive modes, where the palpable sense of momentum is most gripping. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a Knockout!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the &#8220;World&#8221; being a key selling point of the game, it&#8217;s still those core competitive modes that retained the tightest grip on my attention. Whilst the expected familiar selection of Grand Prix, custom VS, Battle, and Time Trial modes are all here, the game deserves credit for also introducing a brand new main mode to go alongside Grand Prix. This goes by the name of Knockout Tour, where 6 different tracks are combined together into one extra-long race. It takes advantage of the increased count of 24 racers to introduce checkpoint gates along the way, eliminating those at the back each time. Essentially, it&#8217;s a way of introducing popular battle royale-esque sensibilities into <em>Mario Kart</em>, and it creates a very fun sense of chaos &#8211; especially in local multiplayer, when your friends and you are desperately trying to stay in the race amidst the various items flying around!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14736" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A road trip across the Mushroom Kingdom! Thankfully, less traffic jams than real life</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Knockout Tours are arguably the biggest challenge awaiting completionist solo players in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It&#8217;s classic knowledge now that to get the maximum 3-star rating in Grand Prix, you need to win all four races; but in Knockout Tour, you need to be leading through every single checkpoint! This is an extremely tough task, as it necessitates not just victory, but to be consistently leading &#8211; even despite homing Red Shells, or the dreaded blue Spiny Shells that target the leader. I set myself the personal challenge of 3-starring every Knockout Tour, and it led to many failed attempts, but it was highly satisfying when I finally achieved that goal. For <em>Mario Kart</em> veterans, it&#8217;s a good addition to have a target that takes this extra level of dedication to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just mentioned the items and the chaos synonymous with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and that side of the game is just as entertaining (and frustrating) as ever before! To me, <em>Mario Kart</em> is similar to other games such as <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> because at their core, each iteration is built on the same gameplay loop, and it makes it tough to critique a new entry &#8211; on one hand, it&#8217;d be unwise to stray too far from what makes the series so immensely popular, but on the other, there has to be enough new ideas to justify a new game that still feels imaginative.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-18 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14737" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14738" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14740" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As aforementioned, the Knockout Tours are a standout way in which <em>Mario Kart World</em> achieves the latter, and some of these ideas bleed over into Grand Prix, where you don&#8217;t just drive around four tracks &#8211; instead, after the first race, the initial laps are rolling starts, as you drive across the world to the next track, road-trip style. It&#8217;s a neat way to keep the same formula but match it to the open-world aesthetic of <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and in VS there are options to play either in this mode, or with the traditional laps, catering to either preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further to this, there are tweaks to the racing itself, the most notable arguably being the new parkour/trick abilities. If you drive up onto a rail, you can grind along it and perform extra trick boosts, and you can even trick onto a wall and wall-ride along it, which opens up jaw-dropping shortcuts if you master this ability (there are plenty of astonishing clips doing the rounds online)! On top of this, drifting boosts can now be used in a straight line, and launch you off the ground slightly to help initiate some of these parkour moves. In combination, all these extra options elevate the height of the skill ceiling, and keep <em>Mario Kart World</em> engaging for those who have mastered previous entries in the series. Crucially, it does this without losing the accessibility as a go-to local multiplayer party game &#8211; the extra skills are a cherry on top for those who want to go above and beyond, but they&#8217;re not essential for winning races against the CPU.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14755" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Boo Cinema is another standout track, which applies a film filter to part of the course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Items are one of the infamous levellers of <em>Mario Kart</em>, and there have been some tweaks and additions on this front too. Your usual roster of shells, bananas, and mushrooms, and more are all here, although it&#8217;s noticeable that the raw power of items such as Bullet Bill have been slightly softened, perhaps to accommodate the new racer count of 24. Some of the notable new items include the golden Coin Shell, which leaves a trail of coins behind it, and the feather, which leaps you into the air, opening another opportunity to perform tricks, wallrides, and other shortcuts. To more literally aid more inexperienced players, there are still the helpful options for motion controls, auto-accelerate, and driving aids. Whilst these aren&#8217;t new, they&#8217;re still great to see return, and are often essential for balanced 4-player sessions that everyone can enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Give Me a Boost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As fun as <em>Mario Kart</em> can be in solo play, multiplayer is where the series has always shined brightest, and that continues to be the case for <em>World</em>. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to play with several combinations of friends, and the game has impressively accommodated their varying levels of <em>Mario Kart</em> experience each time, whether they&#8217;re a fresh newcomer or someone who&#8217;s been away from the series for a while. It&#8217;s easy to criticize the items when they&#8217;re hitting you, but they do a great job at helping those towards the back stay with the pack, and there&#8217;s still the option to use items such as shells and bananas defensively whilst in the lead.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14743" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Expect to shout at your friends &#8211; in a pleasant way, of course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Local multiplayer has consistently resulted in a brilliant time, complete with the playful shouting, cheers, and competitive back-and-forth that you hope for from <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; so I can report that it&#8217;s a success in that department! My favourite local multiplayer option is the extended custom VS modes, which have plenty of customisable options, including speed, difficulty, item frequency, and the amount of races, which go up to 32 at a time. As a big Formula 1 fan, I love to nerd out about the accumulated points and the drama of how the final standings will end up, so VS will inevitably become my most-played mode!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of online play, <em>Mario Kart World</em> doesn&#8217;t quite hit the same heights as local multiplayer, because of that lack of immediate in-person reaction &#8211; and whilst it&#8217;s admirable that Nintendo has added chat functionality, I did end up defaulting to using a Discord call instead, because of the familiarity and ease of use. The main motivation to play online is to raise your versus rating (VR), which is essentially the same system we had way back on <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>. In my opinion, it&#8217;s disappointing that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added more reasons to play online, especially in a gaming landscape where online games consistently add new modes, tournaments, and other rewards for playing consistently. The end result is that I quickly fell off of online multiplayer, and have focused mostly on solo and local multiplayer.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14753" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Driving on water supplies opportunity to perform tricks as you bounce over the waves</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, I found that the returning Battle Mode was most ideal for multiplayer &#8211; in <em>World</em>, there are two options, Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, which will be familiar to players of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. Balloon Battle gives you five balloons to protect whilst doing your best to hit opponents and earn points for removing their balloons, and Coin Runners has you searching for as many coins as you can, whilst again attempting to hit others and remove their coins (whilst avoiding them doing the same to you). I have to say, I&#8217;ve never been a huge Battle Mode fan over the years, and this version hasn&#8217;t changed that &#8211; but conversely, if you love Battle Mode, this will fill that quota well. My main disappointment is that the modes are time-based instead of score-based, as I generally prefer having that concrete target and the tension of seeing who can reach it first. Despite my criticisms, I am glad Battle Mode is back, as it offers a welcome change of pace from the racing modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Free as a Birdo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, a major differentiator for <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the inclusion of a free roam mode, where you can explore the tracks (and the spaces between them) at your leisure. There&#8217;s certainly an immediate novelty to this &#8211; I have nostalgic memories of <em>LEGO Racers 2</em>, which I played a lot on PC as a child, and included a similar experience of exploring an open world between races in a colourful, family-friendly world. My hope was that <em>Mario Kart World</em> might recapture that whimsical feeling, and supply a world with plenty of secrets and rewards, and most importantly motivation to find them. At first, <em>World </em>is successful in this; one of my earliest ventures was rocking up to the Dino Dino Jungle area, and visiting the inner laboratory/auditorium section. With precise driving and the careful use of tricks, you can make your way to the top of this area &#8211; which is thrilling the first time, but soon the realisation kicks in that there&#8217;s a lack of reason to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-19 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14746" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14747" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14745" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in free roam,<em> Mario Kart World </em>has an uncanny sense of emptiness, and it&#8217;s partly because that palpable sense of forward energy &#8211; which is so prevalent in the competitive modes &#8211; is gone, without being replaced by much else. It&#8217;s not that there isn&#8217;t anything to do in the open world &#8211; for example, there are Peach Medallions and Question Mark Panels to find, as well as P Switches that activate various challenges &#8211; but the problem is that there isn&#8217;t much motivation to track all these things down. The main rewards are stickers, which are small graphic icons you can attach next to your profile name, and feel inconsequential. More work needed to be done to make the world feel alive, and not just like a suspended state of limbo from the Grand Prix mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toads and Shy Guys milling around and making campfires are a great touch, but they&#8217;re another short-lived novelty that doesn&#8217;t add substance to the experience of navigating the open world. It&#8217;s fun to find items and complete challenges, but they&#8217;re incredibly scattered &#8211; and whilst there&#8217;s a tracker for the Question Mark Panels, there&#8217;s curiously no in-game indicator for how many Medallions or Switches are left to find (and also no statistics or records screen for other modes, either). On the other hand, something free roam does do well is increasing the level of awe the world has. You can travel a long way out into the ocean, and discover sea dragons, whales, and more, and I had a great time inspecting the scale of impressive courses such as DK Spaceport. As mentioned at the start of the review, <em>Mario Kart World</em> is a stunning game to look at and listen to, and the open world gives you more time to do just that.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14748" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>P Switch challenges often consist of time trials</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s a great shame that there&#8217;s no formal splitscreen multiplayer for the open world &#8211; there&#8217;s a partial workaround, by loading into an empty wireless mode lobby, but challenges are turned off, and it&#8217;s not at all optimal. In a game marketed on free roam, and in a series known for local multiplayer, it&#8217;s a disappointing oversight that significantly reduces the reason to play this way. I have occasionally played free roam in single-player as a laid-back secondary experience, for example when listening to a podcast or talking to friends &#8211; but it has untapped potential as a playground for friends to enjoy together, and honestly, I think this would&#8217;ve papered over many of my problems with the emptiness of the open world. Instead, more often than not, you&#8217;ll launch straight into Grand Prix, Knockout Tour, or VS, as that is where the most joyous parts of <em>Mario Kart World</em> reside.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to the end of this review, I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;ve flagged multiple issues I have with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; so I need to re-emphasize that this is a genuinely excellent <em>Mario Kart</em> game, that not only delivers the best-looking and best-sounding entry into the series, but has multiple new ideas and modes that make it feel distinct. Changeable character outfits, new trick mechanics, and especially the Knockout Tour mode supply fresh style that have made <em>World </em>my new go-to local multiplayer game, and a game I&#8217;ve spent many an enjoyable hour in by myself as well. The main disappointment has to be the free roam mode, which feels sparse and quickly struggles to retain player attention &#8211; and I really hope that in the future, Nintendo supports the game with additional content that fills out this world more. Alternatively, add Captain Toad to the playable characters, and I&#8217;ll probably be happy, haha! In all seriousness, <em>Mario Kart World</em> definitely has flaws, but the core racing experience is dazzling, and it&#8217;s a superb way to start the Switch 2 era!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

I&#8217;ve written about this in multiple posts on this site, and I&#8217;ve noticed how I&#8217;m gradually getting deeper into the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> ecosystem: starting with looking back to the anime, and then playing the online game <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and now getting more invested in learning about the current meta and competitive side of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> is a complicated game with lots to learn (and relearn) for someone like me, who hasn&#8217;t been up-to-date on the meta since I stopped playing local tournaments about a decade-and-a-half-ago. But I&#8217;m slowly learning, and I&#8217;m enjoying how it&#8217;s happening naturally, via watching various YouTube creators, playing different decks in <em>Master Duel</em>, and even constructing a real-life deck that I could conceivably return to local tournaments with. So, in this post, I&#8217;m going to talk a little more about these various aspects of the game, the deck I&#8217;m playing, and why I&#8217;m enjoying this process so much!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Getting the Fire (Kings) Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve already written about <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/12/31/why-im-giving-yu-gi-oh-master-duel-another-shot/">how I&#8217;ve gotten back into <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em></a>, but only now have I reached the point where I&#8217;m starting to understand the competitive meta. At first, I was playing relatively low-powered (by current standards) decks such as Dark Magician and Monarchs, because those cards were familiar to me. But realistically, those decks aren&#8217;t fast-paced enough to keep up nowadays, so I started testing other avenues. I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of Gravekeepers, which can sometimes work in the competitive scene, if you draw the right cards (such as Necrovalley) in order to shut off abilities from the opponent. But this wasn&#8217;t a strategy that was going to help me learn the competitive game long-term, and I found that I eventually reached a point of repetition and subsequent burnout playing the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-20 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14664" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14665" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14666" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gravekeepers brought me a decent level of success!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This brought me to the HERO cards, especially Destiny HEROs, as I have a nostalgic affinity for them. The modern HERO cards have many combo effects that special summon various powerful cards, so they were much more helpful for learning the increased modern speed of combos in a deck. But I still found the HERO cards to lack flexibility for different situations, and I again reached a point where I hit a brick wall with the deck. It felt like I had hit also hit a wall in my efforts to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> in a contemporary fashion, as I couldn&#8217;t find a deck I clicked with. So I took a bit of a break from <em>Master Duel</em>, and started looking into which decks would be viable to assemble if I was playing the physical TCG (Trading Card Game). After looking at various Structure Decks as starting points, I finally found one which made sense to test out: Fire Kings!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire Kings are a deck based around monsters that destroy themselves either on the field, in the hand, or from the deck, to then activate various effects, including summoning monsters and destroying cards on the field. In addition, they have an impressive boss monster in &#8220;Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings&#8221;, which can destroy every other monster on the field (and has a magnificent summoning animation in <em>Master Duel</em>, see below)! The fiery aesthetic of these cards is well-realised in the stunning artwork, which mixes regal distinction with blazing power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-21 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14678" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14674" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14676" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14677" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14675" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Master Duel summon animations are, in a word, awesome</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the cards are relatively accessible in the real world, with only &#8220;Fire King Courtier Ulcanix&#8221; demanding a higher price point (of about £15 a copy). Most of the main Fire King cards can be acquired in the modestly priced Fire King Structure Deck &#8211; I bought three copies of this, as well as some other products (such as the recent Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Deck, which includes reprints of staple cards such as Infinite Impermanence), to construct a real-life Fire King deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, I find it helpful to have a real deck in front of me, which I can draw test hands with to slowly understand the playstyle better (I&#8217;m hoping for a reprint of Ulcanix, so I don&#8217;t have to drop £45-ish on a playset)! The result of this process is finally finding an archetype I like, which is viable to build in both <em>Master Duel</em> and the TCG &#8211; and to top it all off, Fire Kings are competitively strong too! Whilst they aren&#8217;t currently considered a top tier deck like Maliss or Ryzeal, Fire Kings do perform well in current competitive play, even winning the YCS Birmingham event this year, piloted by Dinh-Kha Bui! This tells me that if I can improve my own skill and understanding of the deck, then Fire King can reach a high ceiling of play in both <em>Master Duel</em> and local tournaments (should I decide to go&#8230; More on that later)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14669" height="696" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>It needs some changes still, but my TCG Fire King deck is taking shape!</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m playing lots of Fire King in Ranked games on <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and with every game, every new scenario, and every mistake I make (I&#8217;m admittedly still making a lot of those), I&#8217;m learning the intricacies of the deck, how to perform the best combos, and how to make the strongest boards in combination with my Extra Deck of Link, XYZ, and Synchro Monsters. I like how Fire Kings have such a strong Fire connection, which enables them to make use of several non-Fire cards as additions to the deck. For example, a common choice for Fire Kings is &#8220;Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames&#8221;, which can revive back one of your Fire Kings alongside it when summoned. This synergy is very satisfying, and ties into the overall theme of the deck, resulting in an archetype that feels richly-designed and well-realised. I&#8217;m enjoying learning the Fire King strategies, and I hope that by my next <em>Master Duel</em> post on this site, I can report that I&#8217;ve become steadily better at piloting the deck!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Creators I Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside my own proactive efforts to become better at contemporary <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I&#8217;ve been watching several YouTube creators that are a brilliant source of both entertainment and knowledge for me. <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/">In previous posts, I&#8217;ve mentioned</a> how TGS Anime and Team APS helped me get reacquainted with classic <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, which lines up with my aforementioned play of anime decks such as Dark Magician. I still watch these channels, but I&#8217;ve added several others to my regular watchlist, including the &#8220;wonky quartet&#8221; of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGuDrveqBgD0S9nqaOPw6Q">Farfa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MBTYuGiOh">MBT</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Nyhmnim">Nyhmnim</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dzeeff">Dzeeff</a>, who consistently create great content focused primarily around <em>Master Duel</em>. Often, they add fun variables to challenge themselves, such as in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xajsij7iS98">Master Chef</a> series by MBT, or the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbldWY88--A">Storage Wars</a> series by Farfa.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Videos like this (by Joshua Schmidt) are brilliant at showcasing both the fun and skill of </em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly thanks to these channels and their collaborations, I&#8217;ve also become aware of other popular YouTubers &#8211; specifically, ones focused around high-level competitive play. These are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaSchmidtYGO">Joshua Schmidt</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jessekottonygo">Jesse Kotton</a>, who are well-known for often winning or placing highly in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> tournaments. Both of them balance speaking confidently about modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> with also making videos that are fun to watch, which is very impressive and makes them stand out. Both their channels have been helpful to me, and I also like it when they have those earlier-mentioned collaborations with channels like Farfa and MBT, as they bring a little bit of extra seriousness to those videos. Discovering this range of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> players and creators has been an unexpected extra positive side effect of getting back into the game and franchise!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">It&#8217;s Time to Duel?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;ve talked about how I&#8217;ve not just been looking at the digital version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> (with <em>Master Duel</em>), but also my physical collection of cards as well. I have a fairly large amount of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> cards, mostly from my childhood and teenage years, and further supplemented with occasional more recent purchases when something has stood out to me. Those Fire King and Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Decks have given me access to plenty of modern cards to assemble a deck with, and I also picked up products like the Duel Devastator set from 2019, which was full of guaranteed competitive staples like &#8220;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&#8221;. This is all to say that I&#8217;m nearing a place where not only am I improving at <em>Master Duel</em>, but I could conceivably go to an in-person event near me and test out my skills in person (scary, I know, haha)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14673" height="672" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Recent structure decks have been ideal for helping me build Fire Kings</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Jokes aside, there&#8217;s only a few things stopping me from doing this, and one of them is overcoming that social anxiety. I&#8217;ve become better at this over the years, but I definitely find the initial ice-breaking of heading to a new club/group quite daunting. About a year ago, I also experienced this when joining a nearby running club &#8211; there is that initial awkward stage of getting to know people and faces, but it gets easier over time. I&#8217;m confident that this wouldn&#8217;t be a long-term issue, especially as I now know a friend who has introduced me to a local store that hosts Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next barrier is more closely related to the theme of this post &#8211; and that&#8217;s a personal target to be relatively well-acquainted with the game before showing up to a local tournament again. I&#8217;m definitely nearing this stage, and part of this preparation would be making the finishing touches to my Fire King deck. I&#8217;d like to get that playset of three Fire King Courtier Ulcanix first, as they&#8217;re integral to the strength of the deck. The card is out of stock on most sites, and my best route currently seems to be waiting for a good UK price on Cardmarket. I could wait and hope for a cheaper reprint, but there is no sign of this happening at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jesse Kotton has a video about Fire Kings and their affordability</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I&#8217;d like to get a copy of some extra staple Extra Deck cards such as &#8220;S:P Little Knight&#8221;, and possibly acquire some extra non-Fire King cards that often seen play in the deck, such as &#8220;Bystial Magnamhut&#8221; and &#8220;Bystial Druisworm&#8221;. The main thing I&#8217;m keeping an eye on is price &#8211; for example, in an ideal world I&#8217;d also add competitively strong cards such as &#8220;Mulcharmy Fuwalos&#8221; to the deck, but that would cost another £70-ish for a playset, and I haven&#8217;t even gone to a local event yet (I do have a tendency for overthinking)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve still not decided if I&#8217;ll make the time to make the leap to playing the TCG in-person again, but I&#8217;m getting increasingly tempted to have a go. It would enable me to test out my skills, and it could also be a way to make new friends and connections. When I went to local events in my teenage years, I enjoyed the trading side of the game too &#8211; and who knows, perhaps that&#8217;s a better way to acquire some of these missing cards for my Fire King deck. If I do decide to go, I hope to write up about my experience on this site, however well (or badly, haha) it goes!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the third <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> centric post I&#8217;ve written over the last 8 months, and they&#8217;re good reflections of how I&#8217;ve gotten back into the franchise as a whole: not just my nostalgic connection, but how I&#8217;ve been learning about the modern game and how it&#8217;s evolved over time. I admittedly used to be someone who lamented that <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> had become too complicated and suffered from power creep &#8211; and whilst those aren&#8217;t completely untrue, I think they were oversimplifications on my part. Having now taken the time to ingrain myself back into the world of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I see that the game has developed into something new &#8211; something faster, more complex, and in some ways arguably better than before.</p>\n\n\n\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top: 75%;">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this post has explained how I&#8217;m pushing myself to get better at the game, with the conduit of a Fire King deck as my resource for playing the game at a higher skill level than before. I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn still, both about this deck and other decks, but I&#8217;m having an excellent time doing so &#8211; which is probably evidenced by me considering playing the TCG in-person again at some point in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this post, and I sincerely hope you are happy, healthy, and having a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/03/how-fire-kings-are-helping-me-learn-competitive-play-in-yu-gi-oh-master-duel/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Right then, let&#8217;s get into the post, and I hope you enjoy the read!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Edinburgh Marathon 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/">my build-up and training for the Edinburgh Marathon</a> multiple times since I started planning in November 2024, and after a train journey up to Edinburgh and a couple of days in the city, on May 25th 2025 the day finally arrived for my first marathon! My parents and some close friends were there to support me, and I also had the support of all those who contributed to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">my charity fundraiser for Beat</a> (the Eating Disorder charity). Thank you to everyone who donated or even just took a look at my Justgiving page &#8211; I&#8217;m really proud to spread awareness for a charity that means a lot to both my family and I.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14636" height="607" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So, you may be asking, how did the marathon go? It was a tough one, and Scotland threw all the elements at us. There were periods of sun, rain, strong winds, and even hail when I reached approximately mile 20! As expected, the last 10-ish miles are where the battle really begins, as much mental as physical. It was important to me that I do my absolute best and never stop or walk if I can help it, and at mile 25 I got to see my friends and family cheer me on as I neared the finish line!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was an unexpectedly dramatic finish. With the finish line in sight, and as I pushed for the line with maybe 100 metres left to go, I was struck with the notorious &#8220;jelly legs&#8221; and fell. I managed to get back to my feet with the help of another nearby runner, and made it to the line. As someone who is very critical of themselves, I was disappointed at not finishing the run in better style &#8211; and this is where my family and friends were invaluable at stopping me from being too harsh on myself. It was a great reminder of how much they care for me and how much support I had on the day, and I am incredibly grateful to them and everyone else who has congratulated me since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-22 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14624" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Early on&#8230; !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14622" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the race</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14623" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final stretch!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Including Gift Aid, we raised £1,821.77 for Beat, and I&#8217;m very proud of this, as well as the personal achievement of finishing the marathon. I&#8217;m still deciding whether or not to do another marathon &#8211; after not finishing in quite the way I hoped, I am feeling motivated to do another one, maybe the Norfolk Marathon in 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest gaming news stories over the last few months has been the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. As not only a gaming fan but also specifically a Nintendo fan, I got my console immediately, and have been playing it a significant amount since! Whilst it&#8217;s more of an iteration than a revolution in terms of hardware, I personally enjoy the larger console and screen size, as it fits my larger hands very well. The only exclusive game I have so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I&#8217;ve put many an hour into!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14620" height="534" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, <em>Mario Kart World</em> feels like the first new entry since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> many years ago, as I played a lot of the latter on Wii U and never felt the need to buy the <em>Deluxe</em> version on Switch. Therefore, <em>World</em> feels very fresh to me, and it&#8217;s also visually spectacular (especially on a big 4K HDR TV). I&#8217;ve 3-starred all the Grand Prix and am now working away at the Knockout Tours, which are battle-royale style checkpoint races new to this game. These Knockout Tours are very tough to get 3-stars on, but I&#8217;m enjoying the challenge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a few criticisms of the game &#8211; including my own biased disappointment at no inclusion of Captain Toad, haha &#8211; but also about the open-world twist on the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula. In concept, it&#8217;s a smart way to go, but I have mixed feelings on the execution, as the world feels a little empty and repetitive to explore. Despite this, I&#8217;m going to save my full thoughts, as I plan to write a dedicated review at some point soon. One thing is for sure, and that&#8217;s <em>Mario Kart World</em> being the new go-to local multiplayer game for my friends and I!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the Switch 2 itself, it does feel like an investment for the future, as outside of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and now <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> (which I hope to play soon), there&#8217;s a lack of headline exclusive titles. But for now, the hardware upgrade and promise for the future &#8211; plus the fun of <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; has made it feel worth the purchase for this Nintendo fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-text-align-left">My watching habits have been quite eclectic recently! In terms of the films, the standout has to be <em>Superman</em> &#8211; as a huge DC fan, I had high hopes for this fresh, brighter take on the iconic character, and James Gunn and company thoroughly delivered. The film is a shining beacon of positivity, fun, and creativity, and David Corenswet is a brilliant Superman to centre the new DCU around. I&#8217;m very excited to see where things go in the future, but for now I&#8217;m just so happy that we got a satisfyingly hopeful take on Superman again. I&#8217;m hoping that these vibes continue in <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> on the Marvel side, which I&#8217;m going to see tomorrow as of writing this!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-23 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14617" height="1023" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg?w=819" width="819" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14618" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg?w=691" width="691" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of TV, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to <em>The Walking Dead</em> (I really liked the recent film <em>28 Years Later</em>, and I think it&#8217;s helped put me in the zombie mood). I originally stopped watch <em>The Walking Dead</em> in Season 8, which is where a lot of people dropped off, in the war between Rick and Negan. However, I heard that it picks up afterwards, so I decided to go back, charge through Season 8, and see what I find in those last few seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst Season 8 remains a poorly-paced season, I&#8217;m glad I went back, especially because Season 9 is brilliant TV. Clearly lessons were learned from the negative reception to previous seasons, and Season 9 focuses back on character development, inventive new threats, and grounded emotional stakes. It hooked me in and I&#8217;m enjoying the ride of these last few seasons!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m already looking ahead to watching the newer <em>The Walking Dead</em> spin-offs such as <em>The Ones Who Live</em> and <em>Daryl Dixon</em>, to see where these characters end up. Other than <em>The Walking Dead</em>, I&#8217;m also slowly making my way through the latest Marvel show <em>Ironheart</em>, which hasn&#8217;t been marketed very well by Disney &#8211; which is a shame, as it&#8217;s very well-made and full of great performances.  To loop back around to <em>Superman</em> and the DCU, I&#8217;m also eagerly anticipating <em>Peacemaker</em> Season 2, which will tie into that film and the larger world!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this summation of some of what I&#8217;ve been up to recently! One of my goals for the rest of the year is to start writing here more consistently &#8211; I&#8217;ve been saying this for a while, but it&#8217;s something I really want to get back to. It&#8217;s been necessary for me to spend more time on my personal life and take breaks from writing, but in the process of that personal growth, it&#8217;s reminded me how much I like writing about the things I play, watch, and do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I often get distracted or hit writer&#8217;s block, so I&#8217;m considering the approach of setting aside a little bit of time every day to write with no background music/videos, as opposed to my previous strategy of writing in big time chunks all at once. Either way, I&#8217;m planning to be more present on here in the second half of the year, and I look forward to it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sincerely hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a wonderful day!

Many hours of my weekends have been devoted to building up my distance; I am a longtime runner, but had never ran more than a half-marathon before my marathon training this year. Last weekend I did my longest run, a 23.2-miler (my poor legs), and I&#8217;m now tapering down before the big day. My mental health has been low recently, and the marathon has been a good target for my mind to try and focus on, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14584" height="560" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025"><em>https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m both excited and nervous for the event, for which I will be journeying to Edinburgh a few days beforehand. I&#8217;m also doing the run to fundraise for <a href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/">Beat, the Eating Disorder charity</a> &#8211; this is a cause close to my heart, as my amazing sister Charlotte passed away in 2007 after battling anorexia. As aforementioned in my previous post, you can view my Justgiving page <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">at this link</a>, and any donations would be very much appreciated, but there&#8217;s no pressure at all to donate!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Upcoming Book Projects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a designer for Titan Books, I get to work on some really exciting projects, and honestly that fulfilment in my work means a lot to me &#8211; it&#8217;s very rewarding to have a physical product of your work, especially when it&#8217;s related to a property (such as Marvel or <em>Star Trek</em>) that you enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get to experience working on several exciting film retrospectives, and some upcoming ones from Titan include books on <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>,<em> </em>The Crow films, and <em>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</em>, which you can see covers for below!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-24 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14562" height="904" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706" width="706" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14564" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800" width="800" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14563" height="927" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of fiction, the final Mike Hammer novel <em>Baby, It&#8217;s Murder</em> released recently, and there are upcoming Marvel paperbacks for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Annihilation</em> and <em>Doctor Strange: Dimension Wa</em>r.

I&#8217;m very impressed by what was shown, and have my pre-order in for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. Whilst I like physical media, I can&#8217;t justify that high £74.99 price point for buying <em>Mario Kart</em> separately. Those game prices are the main criticism so far &#8211; the only other hesitation is seeing Nintendo choose surety over innovation in terms of hardware. I&#8217;m confident the Switch 2 will be a huge hit, but I do slightly miss those eclectic reveals of the Wii U, 3DS, Wii, DS, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what I&#8217;m playing, I&#8217;ve been struggling with burnout and game-playing-motivation recently, so haven&#8217;t played much. I have however briefly gotten back into<em> Bravely Default</em> on the DS (which ironically has a Switch 2 version coming soon), and continue to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel </em>now and then. I&#8217;m hoping my game-playing motivation returns soon, but am also not putting too much pressure on myself, as I don&#8217;t want to force it. I look forward to the Switch 2 hopefully reigniting that fire a bit &#8211; oh, and please add Captain Toad to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, Nintendo! It would make me very happy indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve admittedly struggled to get back into games recently &#8211; but when it comes to TV, I&#8217;ve been keeping more up-to-date, and there&#8217;s a lot that I&#8217;ve been liking recently! The second season of <em>Andor </em>and second (or fifteenth, depending on how you count) season of <em>Doctor Who</em> are currently airing, and both are fantastic. <em>Andor </em>continues the engrossing drama and brilliantly tangible visual design of the first season, and this era of <em>Doctor Who</em> is really hitting a stride, with unexpected surprises amidst the brilliantly imaginative stories. I really hope the rumours of <em>Doctor Who</em> taking a break after this season are false, as Ncuti Gatwa is sensational, portraying a charismatic and emotionally healed Doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also just finished watching through <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Netflix-verse of Marvel TV (especially<em> Jessica Jones</em>), so to see some of those characters returning has been wonderful. The series feels like both a reinvention and a continuation of the original three <em>Daredevil </em>seasons, and I&#8217;ve been thrilled by how well it has turned out. The character work, cinematography, and courtroom/political intrigue is all here, and I am stoked for Season 2 &#8211; I just hope some of the Defenders do turn up in Season 2, including not just Jessica Jones, but Luke Cage and Iron Fist too!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a quick rundown on what I&#8217;ve been doing, playing, and watching! I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this quick update &#8211; I think of this site like my own digital journal, so even when I take a break, I always like to come back with some sort of update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really hope you are happy and healthy, and that you are having a wonderful week. See you next time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mikehammer_babyitsmurder_fc.jpg?w=666', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/81tvyzi3mvl._sl1500_.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doctorstrange_dimensionwar_salescover-1.jpg?w=678', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/godzillamovienovelization_omnibus_salescvr_dec24.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}]}

With such an expansive and imaginative open world, it&#8217;s a double-edged sword when it comes to DLC; on one hand, you know people like this world, but on the other, you really have to make the expansion stand out from that world to set it apart. For <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, this is done with a new area named The Cut, full of cold weather, dangerous new machines such as the Scorcher, and intriguing story reveals that bridge the gap between <em>Zero Dawn</em> and the sequel <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/03/30/horizon-forbidden-west-review/">Forbidden West</a></em> (incidentally, the only reason I haven&#8217;t included the <em>Forbidden West</em> DLC on this list is because I don&#8217;t have a PS5 to play it on)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cut is full of activities for main character Aloy, whether it be exploration, narrative, or combat &#8211; including optional super-hard combat trials for the real masochists among us. The local tribe (named the Banuk) tie into the aforementioned overarching story, and as Aloy discovers literal machinations under the snow-covered surface of The Cut, it increased my anticipation around where the sequel will go next &#8211; which is surely a sign of a successful DLC. When I wrote <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/02/14/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds-review/">my review for <em>The Frozen Wilds</em></a> back in 2018, I also noted how it made small steps to improve dialogue animations (which were sometimes quite static in the main game), and you can see how that was continued to full fruition in the dynamic conversations of <em>Forbidden West</em>. Not only is <em>The Frozen Wilds</em> substantial and utterly beautiful to look at, but it actively improves the gameplay foundation of a series I adore.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Mass Effect 3: Leviathan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious choices when it comes to <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC are the fantastic <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> for <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, or the <em>Citadel </em>DLC that served as an epilogue for <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. However, the expansion I have the strongest personal connection to is <em>Leviathan</em>, the first of the <em>Mass Effect 3</em> DLCs. I only bought an Xbox 360 shortly before <em>Mass Effect 3</em> launched, and that game was my gateway into the series (I went back and played the entire trilogy afterwards). After mainly playing on Nintendo consoles beforehand, the concept of single-player expansions was relatively foreign to me &#8211; but after being so enraptured by <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, I was incredibly excited at the prospect of more story content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ending of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is infamous for being disappointing to many people &#8211; but in a way, it made me more excited for DLC that would further flesh out the backstory of the giant world-destroying Reapers that you face throughout the trilogy. <em>Leviathan </em>is all about the discovery of a secret race named (you guessed it) Leviathans, who predate even the mysterious Reapers. In the DLC, you journey across space to piece together morsels of information about their origins. I particularly like the planet 2181 Despoina, a planet covered in water and full of secrets and intense combat situations. That sense of discovering places that were meant to be hidden forever is thrilling, especially when you get to the climactic moments that reveal how the Leviathans play into the wider battle against the Reapers &#8211; and it&#8217;s that rush of energy that makes <em>Leviathan </em>stand out as my favourite <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker &#8211; Special Episode</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very happy when <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> got a Switch release, as it allowed even more people to play this gem of a game &#8211; and I was even happier when in early 2019, a new selection of levels was added with the <em>Special Episode</em> expansion! Whilst this isn&#8217;t a large single-player story expansion like some of the other games I&#8217;ve included in this list, I wanted to highlight this DLC for <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, as it&#8217;s a joyful addition with plenty of value for money (currently £5.39 on Switch). Also, yes, I&#8217;m biased for Captain Toad, but that&#8217;s besides the point, aha&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who haven&#8217;t played <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, it&#8217;s a delightful puzzle game that sees Captain Toad and Toadette make their way through levels based on Hakoniwa Japanese box gardens, with the player rotating and shifting the levels around in order to progress. The <em>Special Episode</em> adds 5 brand new levels and 13 challenges that reinvent previous courses, so 18 new levels to play through in total. As with the main game, there&#8217;s a lovely variety, from haunted caves full of Boos, to a treacherous ship, to another minecart ride! As <em>Treasure Tracker</em> is presented in several book chapters, the DLC additions fit in smoothly, and I&#8217;d frankly happily play as many levels as Nintendo is happy to add (I really hope we get a sequel one day)! The <em>Special Episode</em> is a wonderful and endearing addition to <em>Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Dragon Age: Inquisition &#8211; Trespasser</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a brilliant time with all of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> DLCs, but it&#8217;s the final DLC <em>Trespasser </em>that&#8217;s my favourite of the bunch. Requiring story completion to play, it&#8217;s a definitive end &#8211; and cliffhanger &#8211; to <em>Inquisition</em>, even preventing you from returning to the main game afterwards. The plot brings the player to a summit assembled to decide what happens to the Inquisition now that the main threat has been ended, but soon a new conspiracy is discovered. This eventually reveals that Solas (an eleven mage who&#8217;s a consistent presence in the <em>Dragon Age</em> series) is secretly Fen&#8217;Harel and the Dread Wolf. He&#8217;s been responsible for many of the magical occurrences that have played a part in the game, and he&#8217;s now seeking to collapse the Veil that separates worlds, despite the catastrophic consequences it&#8217;d cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For players who&#8217;ve spent many hours around this character who they thought was on their side, it&#8217;s a dramatic reveal that created a lot of excitement for the sequel to <em>Inquisition</em>. Solas even cuts off the arm of the main character to prevent them stopping him, before disappearing and leaving the player with the decision of whether the Inquisition should be continued or disbanded. <em>Trespasser </em>does have competent combat elements too, but the story is the focus here, and it&#8217;s always been memorable thanks to the anticipation it created for the sequel. However, despite <em>Trespasser </em>releasing in 2015, we only got <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/08/04/dragon-age-the-veilguard-why-im-optimistic-what-id-like-to-see-next/">The Veilguard</a></em> at the end of 2024, so it did leave a lot of time for players to stew and theorize!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Resident Evil 5: Lost in Nightmares/Desperate Escape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I first played <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/02/resident-evil-5-review/">Resident Evil 5</a></em> in 2020, and I did so on PS4, where both the DLC expansions <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> and <em>Desperate Escape</em> are bundled in with the main game, so I&#8217;m going to include them both together for the purposes of this list. Whilst <em>Resident Evil 5</em> certainly has flaws, it also has a lot to praise, such as how it leans into cinematic storytelling. The two DLCs act as a prequel and an in-between-quel, and give an opportunity to play as series mainstay (and <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/23/my-5-favourite-video-game-characters/">my favourite <em>Resident Evil</em> character</a>) Jill Valentine, as well as the pilot Josh Stone. Firstly, <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> is set before <em>Resident Evil 5</em>, and shows Jill and Chris Redfield infiltrating the Spencer estate to confront Albert Wesker. We see snippets of this encounter &#8211; which leaves Jill presumed dead &#8211; during the main game as flashbacks, but here we get to play through it all: puzzles, combat, and Wesker boss fight included. Jill and Chris are the quintessential <em>Resident Evil</em> partners, so it&#8217;s comforting to see them interact (well, as comforting as it can be when facing down monstrosities).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Desperate Escape</em> is set towards the end of the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> campaign, just after Sheva Alomar and Chris manage to free Jill from the mind control of Wesker. Whilst the former pair go after Wesker in the main game, we never got to see how Jill and Josh made their own way out, and we get to play that out for ourselves here. This is arguably the tougher DLC of the two, less puzzle-focused and more about, well, desperately escaping &#8211; ending with a horde-assault sequence that gets frenetic on the higher difficulties. Both DLCs are great for different reasons, and as a combo add a lot to the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> story experience. Jill getting her time to shine is great too, especially as she wasn&#8217;t playable in the main game. This is timeline-wise the last time we got to play as Jill in the main story, too &#8211; please take the hint, Capcom&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The Last of Us: Left Behind</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You knew this had to be on here, right? In my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> rose the bar for story expansions, just like <em>The Last of Us</em> rose the bar for narrative video games. <em>Left Behind</em> fits into the later portions of <em>The Last of Us</em>, after Joel is near-fatally injured, and Ellie is hunting for medical supplies in an abandoned mall. This forms part of Left Behind, but it&#8217;s also interspersed with flashbacks to three weeks before the main game, where Ellie is taken by her friend Riley to break into another abandoned mall in Boston &#8211; and this is where the DLC shines at its brightest. As with many of the other expansions in my list, the core gameplay is a solid continuation of the main game, but it&#8217;s the story advancements and believable character interactions which leave the strongest impact here, giving us brand new information on Elie and her backstory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the best parts of the DLC aren&#8217;t fighting infected, but instead when Riley and Ellie are exploring the desolate mall. They find carousels, video games, and plenty more to play with and talk about. The in-gameplay dialogue that <em>The Last of Us</em> uses so well is continued here, resulting in a moment between the two girls that is both natural and surprising, especially for blockbuster games at the time. It&#8217;s all interwoven with that bittersweet sense that something bad is going to happen &#8211; after all, this is an apocalyptic world, we didn&#8217;t hear much about Riley in the main game, and we know Ellie gets bitten at some point. Those moments do come, but they maintain all their dramatic impact because of the masterful way Naughty Dog combines gameplay and narrative (and also because of brilliant performances by Yaani King as Riley and Ashley Johnson as Ellie). As I said at the start &#8211; in my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> raised the bar for story expansions, and it&#8217;s still one of my favourites to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>With that, we come to the end of the list! As mentioned earlier, there are plenty other great DLC expansions out there, but these are six of my own favourites, each for their own specific reasons.

Therefore, I thought I&#8217;d give a quick overview of what&#8217;s been added to the game and why I&#8217;ve found it so rewarding!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Look to the Skies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s immediately obvious which archetype Konami is pushing with this event &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the Sky Strikers, who were introduced back in 2018 and have become incredibly popular since. The first two <em>Master Duel </em>anniversaries tied into Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so it&#8217;s admittedly a shame we don&#8217;t have a Red-Eyes Black Dragon event to round out the central three <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> Duel Monsters characters of Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey &#8211; but I suppose the power of the fan-favourite Sky Striker characters Raye and Roze was just too strong!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14502" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14515" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14519" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png" width="2560" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop is filled with new items featuring board backgrounds, player mates, card backs, a deck box, and more focused around the Sky Strikers, plus admittedly stunning alternate arts for the main Sky Striker cards. I&#8217;m not an expert on the archetype, but all the amazing artwork and shiny bonuses definitely has me intrigued to learn more about the characters!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of&#8230; The new solo Story is unsurprisingly focused around the Sky Strikers. However, what makes this even more special is the addition of animated sequences within the Sky Striker story, which have been taken from the upcoming anime <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME: THE CHRONICLES</em>. For those who don&#8217;t know, Konami recently announced that this anime will be starting in April 2025, and will be focused on the actual card lore itself. So, instead of revolving around duels (like <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em>, <em>5D&#8217;s</em>, or <em>Arc-V</em> did, for example), <em>CHRONICLES </em>will be set within the world of the cards, which is very exciting! It&#8217;s been announced that these episodes will include the archetypes Fall of Albaz, Dogmatika Ecclesia, and yes &#8211; Sky Strikers!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14505" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14507" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14508" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing small clips of the anime in the <em>Master Duel</em> solo mode was unexpected, and acts as a lovely tease of what&#8217;s to come. The animation is vibrant and expressive, and it&#8217;s great to see this willingness to expand on the card lore &#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely be checking these anime episodes out as they release. Also I have to mention that the new UI for the solo mode is much improved and more player-friendly, segmenting the various solo stories up in a cleaner way, which I appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Festival Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next major addition to <em>Master Duel</em> is the two Festivals that are happening this month &#8211; the first one, Legend Anthology, features a custom banlist that excludes common staples, such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. In theory, this shakes up the meta within the mode, especially with three pre-made decks ready for players to use. However, this mode is dominated by the new Exodia deck and cards, in particular The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate, which can reach upwards of 10000 ATK and can also negates card effects. Often, the match is decided on the coin flip, as if a player goes first and gets out this Exodia card, it&#8217;s extremely hard to the opponent to stage a comeback. Still, the mode has plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, so it&#8217;s worth grinding through.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14511" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14510" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14509" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m much more excited for the upcoming Fusion X Synchro Festival (starting 17th February), which will restrict the Extra Deck to only Synchro/Fusion monsters, and cut out all the options that Link and XYZ monsters have added. I&#8217;m growing to respect those newer card types more over time, but it&#8217;ll still be fun to play some games that make players revert to pre-XYZ strategies. Hopefully it&#8217;ll allow some of my older classic decks to be a bit more viable (at least briefly)! Just like the Legend Anthology, there are plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, which should make it worth the playtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Plenty of Prizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that has always pleasantly surprised me about <em>Master Duel</em> is how generous it is as a Free-to-Play game. The 3rd Anniversary is timed with the start of a new Duel Pass, which is a 700-Gem purchase that &#8211; if you complete it &#8211; earns you all your Gems back, as well as cosmetic and in-game currency rewards, such as a background themed around the aforementioned Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate. If I had to suggest improvements, it would be for a few more unique cosmetic rewards in the Pass &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to complain too much about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the Sky Striker items I mentioned earlier, the shop also has a new Structure Deck full of the expensive HERO cards, new Selection Packs that include those new Exodia cards, as well as another chance to buy previous Anniversary-exclusive items themed around Blue-Eyes White Dragon. As someone who took a long break from <em>Master Duel</em>, I appreciate this a lot, and am slowly working my way through acquiring these.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14517" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14512" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14514" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The deck that&#8217;s currently giving me the most success is my anti-meta Gravekeeper deck, which I&#8217;ve fine-tuned to include more drawing cards and be more reliable (see the decklist image above). I&#8217;ve also finally put together my Destiny HERO deck, which is more meta, and features more Extra Deck combo cards. For long-term success in <em>Master Duel</em>, I need to learn more of these combo plays (and how to combat other combo decks), so I don&#8217;t want to stick with anti-meta decks like Gravekeepers for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my quick summation of the new <em>Master Duel</em> features and how they&#8217;ve positively affected the game &#8211; I&#8217;m really enjoying the amount to do right now, as well as the continued support Konami is bringing. I&#8217;m still slowly re-acclimatising myself to <em>Master Duel</em> after such a long time away, but I&#8217;m continuing to enjoy it and play a few duels every day. If anyone else is intrigued in giving the game a shot, I&#8217;d say now is an ideal time to jump on board, as the game is offering many player-friendly rewards that not only play on nostalgia for <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, but also relate to future projects like the <em>CHRONICLES </em>anime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this quick article &#8211; and if you&#8217;re playing <em>Master Duel</em>, let me know how you&#8217;re finding it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}]}

There are always various things I want to do, each and every day &#8211; <em>want to</em> being the operative word here, not <em>have to</em>, which makes all the difference to me &#8211; and it still feels like I&#8217;m having a big adventure.</p>\n<p>By now I&#8217;m firmly settled in tier five, which means that I&#8217;ve pretty much explored the whole of Hagga Basin (with only a few bandit outposts missing here and there), fulfilled almost all contracts, and of course crafted a Scout Ornithopter as well as the much bigger Assault variant. I actually had to modify my base&#8217;s hangar quite a bit to make room for the latter, and it still just about fits in there.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8549" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8549 size-full" height="287" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky2.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8549">It dwarfs the buggy parked below, and that thing&#8217;s by no means small</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Just like the buggy before it, getting the first flying vehicle has changed how the game is played substantially. It obviously makes getting to places go much quicker, and even regions <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/23/every-day-on-arrakis-is-an-adventure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as jagged as Hagga Rift</a> have become pretty easy to traverse all of a sudden.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8550" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8550 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8550">No more getting lost down there, ha!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In most other games I&#8217;d probably have perceived this as a downside. In my opinion advanced means of travel often lead to the game world shrinking to the point of not feeling like a <em>world</em> at all anymore. On Arrakis it&#8217;s different somehow.</p>\n<p>First of all, it&#8217;s <em>extremely</em> fun! Turning off the engines and gliding in near silence over and across this beautiful landscapes is a feeling that screenshots can&#8217;t convey &#8211; it has to be experienced.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8551 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky4.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Another important aspect is that the game is very well designed in terms of progression.</p>\n<p>Just as I was realizing how big even the starting area is and how far apart the safe zones are, I got to build a sand bike. Next up the weight and volume of all kinds of stuff kept getting bigger, and harvesting the increasing amounts of required resources by hand got a bit tedious&#8230;buggy to the rescue!</p>\n<p>And now that I can fly everywhere? What do you know, the next tier of resources can only be found far out in the middle of nowhere &#8211; and &#8220;nowhere&#8221; is completely irradiated to boot, so getting in and out quickly is key.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8552" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8552 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8552">I&#8217;m NOT stepping into that sludge, hazmat suit or no!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In other words, everything happens or becomes available at just the right time, which I find pretty amazing.</p>\n<p>The devs took that into account when designing the various contracts, too. In the early game everything is relatively close by, and backtracking is rarely needed. By contrast, the other day I flew no less than four times to Harko Village and back to Hagga Basin because multiple quest lines I was working on required it. Without my own &#8216;thopter this would have been extremely inconvenient &#8211; and expensive, too &#8211; but as these were mid- to late-game contracts it is (correctly) assumed that zipping to and fro isn&#8217;t a problem anymore at that point.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8553" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8553 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky6.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8553">So they <strong>do</strong> have castles and such on Arrakis after all</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Speaking of quests, I&#8217;ve recently finished the first DLC-storyline, and I think it&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s divided into a continuation of the main story, which all players get for free, and a separate, paywalled questline.</p>\n<p>The latter&#8217;s overarching theme is &#8220;Bad AI&#8221;, or at the very least &#8220;Dangerous AI&#8221;, and not only does that fit well into the time we&#8217;re living in, it&#8217;s also a way for the devs to do something very different while not actually deviating from Dune lore.</p>\n<p>The screenshot above shows a game world designed by an AI for its coder and best (and only) friend. I think you can guess what kind of game it&#8217;s supposed to be. I especially appreciate the effort that went into changing even loot containers and such to fit the game&#8217;s aesthetics. It&#8217;s actually quite a sad story, but I liked it.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8554 size-full" height="299" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky7.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Another AI has developed more of a sinister personality, and its hiding place very much reflects that. It&#8217;s basically <em>Dead Space</em> on Arrakis. Really intense, that one!</p>\n<p>Recovering the third AI (which actually comes first when you play through it in order) wasn&#8217;t as memorable, but it&#8217;s still a cool introduction to the theme.</p>\n<p>Each of these quests culminates in a boss battle. Those aren&#8217;t particularly difficult, but I was glad to have <em>The Sentinel</em> equipped (as always), the little floating turret from the Mentat skill tree, because it helped immensely with keeping the swarms of AI-controlled opponents at bay.</p>\n<p>As of yet I haven&#8217;t even built the DLC-exclusive vehicle, the Treadwheel, nor have I used the Duneman building set, but I can highly recommend buying this piece of content for the storyline alone. It&#8217;s of the short variety for sure, but add in the other stuff and I think it&#8217;s well worth the 13 bucks.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8555" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8555 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8555">&#8220;Help me, Mailvaltar, you&#8217;re my only hope!&#8221; Or something.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The new main story quests are pretty cool, too. Among other things I&#8217;ve infiltrated the hideout of a Harkonnen cannibal (seriously), eliminated a cultist leader, and solved a full-blown murder mystery. Like most endeavours in this universe all of this turns out to be quite a bit more ambiguous than it seems at first. Very few things are strictly black or white.</p>\n<p>Also, we get to learn important details about our own origin, which I obviously won&#8217;t spoil here.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8556" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8556 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8556">Oh, look, it&#8217;s the Three Stooges</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I just realized that I&#8217;ve talked about combat encounters quite a lot by now, but I&#8217;ve yet to give my verdict of whether fighting in Dune: Awakening actually feels any good.</p>\n<p>Well&#8230;kinda.</p>\n<p>This <em>is</em> a game made by Funcom, and if you&#8217;ve played <em>The Secret World</em> you know what that means. It&#8217;s&#8230;janky, for lack of a better word. For example, it&#8217;s very easy to get stuck on the tiniest pieces of terrain, which can get you in big trouble when multiple enemies are trying to kill you at the same time.</p>\n<p>Also, you get staggered or stunned all the fricking time, and while that&#8217;s not due to said jankyness but a deliberate design decision (at least I assume that it is) that&#8217;s not really fun, and also <em>very</em> dangerous for obvious reasons.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8557" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8557 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sky10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8557">Gross&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Surprisingly though, I enjoy the combat quite a lot despite these shortcomings.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not really difficult in the usual sense of the word, but since it&#8217;s always a bit unpredictable it&#8217;s not exactly easy either. And, as I&#8217;ve talked about in the post linked at the top, there <em>is</em> a death penalty in place, so dying isn&#8217;t something that I want to happen often. Side note: I made a mistake in that post when I said that you drop only Solaris when you die in PvE &#8211; items you&#8217;ve looted like schematics, spice-infused dust etc. drop on death too, and you&#8217;ll usually want that stuff back.

While I was building my first two bases in <em>Dune: Awakening</em> those limits already reared their ugly head, as I had a really hard time imagining how to mold all those different floors, walls, roofs, inclines and whathaveyou into anything other than a functional but ugly cube. I would not have made a good architect, that much is certain.</p>\n<p>I knew that I wanted my next and probably permanent main base to look at least somewhat nice though, so I started to look around and see what other players have done to get some inspiration.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, YouTube turned out to be the best place for that. What <em>did</em> surprise me was that some folks don&#8217;t just show off their great designs, they&#8217;ve even included step by step instructions to recreate them.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8517 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s what I did to get started. Many thanks to Arathy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@crimsonfelisbuilds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crimson Builds</a> for creating this base and taking the time to make that video!</p>\n<p>I still had to get a bit creative though, because, as you can see, the site I&#8217;d chosen to build the base at isn&#8217;t just flat land &#8211; what can I say, I <em>need</em> to have a room with a view &#8211; and the game doesn&#8217;t support terraforming. You <em>can</em> build in, around and even through concrete rock, but there are limits. Also, when there&#8217;s rock or sand inside your base you can&#8217;t place any facilities or furniture on top of it.</p>\n<p>To circumvent losing too much usable space on the ground floor I&#8217;d raised the foundations as much as possible at first &#8211; it seemed to be a good idea at the time. I didn&#8217;t place all of them right away though, as I needed to procure a lot more resources for the full build first. To protect the buggy and myself in the meantime I quickly erected some walls and a roof, and placed some generators, water cisterns and storage containers to collect and refine the building materials on site.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8518 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion3.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Once preparations were completed I tore down the roof and walls again and extended the foundations in all directions to complete the intended footprint &#8211; at least I tried to. Unfortunately the natural ground declines a bit towards the cliffs, and the game didn&#8217;t let me place the last row for lack of support.</p>\n<p>Adjacent foundations have to be built at the same height, so I had no other choice than to tear them all down and start over. However, there was lots of stuff lying around by now. Grrrr!</p>\n<p>What happened next was basically a game of Tetris. Move all facilities to one side, tear some foundations down, build new ones on a lower level, push everything onto those, destroy the rest&#8230;all while trying not to get a sunburn and hoping for the next sandstorm to take its sweet time.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8519" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8519 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8519">I&#8217;ve got the power!

Also, <em>now</em> I&#8217;m much more in my element again, namely taking something that&#8217;s already there and refining it to my liking. I add, remove or memodel bits and pieces all the time, and I&#8217;ll continue to do so until I&#8217;m completely satisfied.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;generator wing&#8221; seen above, for example, was a thorn in my side right from the start. Then I remembered that those things basically don&#8217;t have to be touched anymore once they&#8217;re up and running, so I built another floor on top of them and covered the gap with some stairs. Now it&#8217;s as if that part of the house doesn&#8217;t exist, and I&#8217;ve gained an elevated relaxation- or conference-area that I didn&#8217;t have room for before.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8520" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8520 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mansion5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8520">The pillar I&#8217;m standing on usually isn&#8217;t there of course</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I have few points of comparison, but I think the building system is really robust and fairly easy to use.

You can buy more and more different furniture- as well as building-sets over time, too. I just wish those schematics would state the required resources.

Funcom held a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/build-your-dune-winners/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">building contest</a> a while ago, and many of the entries, even the ones that didn&#8217;t win, are absolutely awesome.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/buildyourdune1_1080.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8525 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/buildyourdune1_1080.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>This one is my favourite.

No, what&#8217;s really extraordinary is that each and every one of those hours felt exciting and full of discovery and adventure.

Well, there are quite a few contributing factors.</p>\n<p>First of all, there is actual danger. Heat, storms, radiation, fricking high rock formations and deep chasms, quicksand, overall pretty tough enemies and, of course, sandworms. On Arrakis absolutely everything is trying to kill you.</p>\n<p>Now, except for when <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/15/the-desert-giveth-shai-hulud-taketh-away/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">being swallowed by a worm</a> the penalty for dying usually isn&#8217;t all that harsh. You drop any Solari you had on you, and if you didn&#8217;t place a respawn beacon nearby you may find yourself quite a ways away from where you were. You can still go back and reclaim your cash though, so all you&#8217;ll lose is some time. And water. And probably some durability on your vehicle of choice.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8481" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8481 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8481">Oh, you&#8217;ve got to be kidding me</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Dying&#8217;s not the end of the world, is what I&#8217;m saying, but you&#8217;d still prefer it didn&#8217;t happen. Which is why I always try to be cautious and alert, and I&#8217;ve died only three times total thus far as a result.</p>\n<p>For me this really hits kind of a sweet spot. Death penalties suck ass in games where you inevitably die very often, possibly even without you having any chance to prevent it &#8211; think an MMORPG dungeon group wiping repeatedly because others aren&#8217;t doing their jobs.</p>\n<p>However, when dying is of absolutely no consequence there can be no sense of danger. So penalizing death, but not too severely, <em>and</em> giving me the agency to prevent it from ever happening (at least theoretically) is the optimal way to do it in my opinion, as it causes just the right amount of tension.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8482" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8482 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8482">I cranked up the brightness by a lot already, believe it or not</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As I said earlier, human beings and gigantic worms aren&#8217;t the only dangerous things on Arrakis. The area pictured on the two screenshots above is called Hagga Rift, and I&#8217;ve never seen, much less traversed, a more jagged and fascinating, yet also disorienting and treacherous landscape in a game before.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine getting around on foot or bike isn&#8217;t an easy feat here, and I got very confused during my first forays into the area. That it gets really dark the closer to the canyon&#8217;s bottom you get doesn&#8217;t help one bit.</p>\n<p>Even when I slowly started to know my way around the environment kept throwing curveballs at me. Like when I fell through a hole in the floor while looting a shipwreck (did I mention that it&#8217;s fricking dark down there?), only that said hole didn&#8217;t lead to where I thought it would &#8211; as it turned out I&#8217;d already been on the ship&#8217;s lowest deck, and I now found myself in a free fall all the way down into the canyon.

Reminds me a bit of Arizona, to be honest.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the landscape either, the enemies and their bases also have their very own aesthetics. Like this lair that, if you ask me, kinda screams &#8220;death cult&#8221;&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8484" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8484 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures6.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8484">No, I&#8217;m not staying, but thanks for asking</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The imperial testing stations I&#8217;ve <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/10/arrakis-is-a-perilous-place-even-in-the-shade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">talked about before</a> are also varied enough to not become a bore.

In the end I always do make it back of course, and that&#8217;s just the greatest and most satisfying sensation.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8486" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8486 size-full" height="305" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8486">We want it just like it was. A brand new dune buggy. Otherwise we&#8217;ll get mad!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t even mentioned yet that I&#8217;ve crafted this cool ride by now, have I? Well, there it is.</p>\n<p>Having a buggy really changes the game quite significantly. For one, its cutteray sucks so much more material out of resource nodes than the handheld version that it&#8217;s not even funny. Naturally it can also carry a crapton of stuff to go along with that, which is not only great for gathering, but also for moving shit around between bases &#8211; or for moving bases altogether.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8487" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8487 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8487">Leaving my Borg Cube behind for good&#8230;more about my new base next time</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At this stage of the game these features aren&#8217;t just nice to have though, they pretty much become a necessity. Building things like better refineries, bigger water cisterns and so on requires more and more resources, and as a consequence your base keeps growing not only in size, but also in terms of how much stuff you have crammed into it.</p>\n<p>Which is another thing that Dune: Awakening does very well in my opinion: progression.</p>\n<p>It all feels very natural to me, and it&#8217;s paced just right. Moving through the resource tiers happens more or less on autopilot thus far, and I feel neither forced to rush anything, nor held back in any way. It&#8217;s also very satisfying to progress to the next tier because of little details like, for instance, the bigger ore refinery not only allowing you to process new types of materials, but also being more efficient when refining the &#8220;old&#8221; tiers.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8488" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8488 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8488">These things keep getting bigger and bigger though</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I really like how the skill trees open up more and more over time, too. Many abilities and passives have three ranks, but when you first gain access to a new class you can only spend points on the first rank of each. Working for the advanced trainers (most of which are found in either Arakeen or Harko Village) unlocks the second and third ranks as well as the special Spice-skills over the course of several quests.</p>\n<p>Since basically everything you do in the game rewards XP you keep levelling up all the time (I&#8217;m currently at level 129), and as each ding grants one additional skill point they tend to pile up. Thus, whenever I&#8217;ve increased the rank of a skill tree or unlocked a new one, I&#8217;ve always had just about the right amount of available skill points to pick or level up the ones that seemed useful to me.</p>\n<p>One thing that&#8217;s severely lacking, though, is having skill loadouts or something like that. It&#8217;s really tedious to swap around skills one by one, and since we can choose only three at a time (until you&#8217;ve reached a certain point in the main story it&#8217;s actually only <em>two</em>) not switching at all isn&#8217;t an option. Please, Funcom, do it! Give it a cooldown of a minute or two, I don&#8217;t care, but we really need this.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures11.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8489 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moreadventures11.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>And that shall be enough for today.

Well, when I realized that I didn&#8217;t have nearly enough screenshots of Imperial Testing Station No. 10 for <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/09/10/arrakis-is-a-perilous-place-even-in-the-shade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my post about the adventure I had in there</a> I decided to pay Station No. 2 another visit and take some more there. And, to be quite honest, I&#8217;d become a bit too comfy and carefree by then, so instead of hugging the rocky areas as much as possible I took a pretty long route across open sand. I thought that I&#8217;d be okay as long as I stayed clear of drum sand.</p>\n<p>I was mistaken. When the aggro meter turned red while I was still a couple hundred meters away from safety I knew I was in trouble. Luckily I had a booster equipped to the sandbike (the alternatives being a cargo crate or passenger seat), and I saved that for the moment you see on the picture above so as to not overheat it too early.</p>\n<p>How close of a call was it? Well&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8441" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8441 size-full" height="303" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8441">When the red squiggly line seen below me looks like this, GTFO!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The moment I hit the screenshot key I thought I was done for. But lo and behold, one second later the worm stopped its chase and disappeared below the sand for good. Phew (once again)!</p>\n<p>However, just a day later I wasn&#8217;t so lucky.</p>\n<p>At that point various contracts were asking me to venture further north, and to do so one has to traverse the first instances of quicksand. While moving on drum sand &#8220;only&#8221; increases worm aggro, quicksand is (as far as I know) a death trap for players and vehicles alike. And it&#8217;s fricking everywhere.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8442" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8442 size-full" height="349" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8442">Drum sand due south, lots and lots of quicksand up north</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While it is marked clearly on the map, and also looks a bit different from normal sand in the game world itself, I didn&#8217;t want to risk my bike regardless, so I decided to walk.</p>\n<p>Outside of drum sand I&#8217;d never had aggroed a worm while on foot until then, so I thought this to be the safest option.</p>\n<p>Once more I was mistaken. When the worm came I used everything I had at my disposal to escape, but even with <em>Bindu Sprint</em> and <em>Shigawire Claw</em> (from the Bene Gesserit and Trooper skill tree, respectively) I was much too slow.

In the bigger camps and dungeons they&#8217;re usually located in or past the boss room, or all the way at the top in the more vertical ones, and basically can&#8217;t be missed.

I have, for example, farmed one specific chest for days on end, because I wanted to get my hands on the unique rifle that only drops there. Said rifle is just one of three schematics on that chest&#8217;s table though, and I got the (also useful) sandbike engine once, and the scattergun (which I didn&#8217;t want at all) <em>six fricking times</em> before the rifle finally made an appearance.</p>\n<p>I have even logged off there to do something else for a while, then logged back in just to loot the chest again.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8446" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8446 size-full" height="315" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wormsanduniques8.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8446">Sometimes they&#8217;re smaller for some reason</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Despite the RNG repeatedly being a dick I quite enjoy this whole part of the gameplay loop though.

And boy, did the game deliver on all fronts already!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m almost 30 hours in now, have moved into the second area and crafting tier, built my second base, discovered new technologies for gathering resources, and unlocked my fourth of the five available classes.</p>\n<p>What I&#8217;d like to focus on today, though, is my first foray into one of the game&#8217;s large dungeons, because that was an experience I&#8217;ll not forget anytime soon indeed.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8404 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Most PvE content in Dune: Awakening is more or less static, with enemies hanging around camps, in caves or shipwrecks. You go there, clear them out, loot everything and leave again. Calling these places &#8216;dungeons&#8217; would be overstating things, because they range from a single campfire to a couple of adjacent rooms or caverns at most.</p>\n<p>However, there are <em>real</em> dungeons too. They go by the rather unimpressive name <em>&#8220;Imperial Testing Station No. XY&#8221;</em>, but I assure you, they are anything but.</p>\n<p>You get to explore the first one of those, Station No. 2 (don&#8217;t ask me what happened to No. 1&#8230;) in the newbie region already, and while that wasn&#8217;t a cakewalk when I went there only a couple of hours into the game, it didn&#8217;t quite make me break a sweat either.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8405" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8405 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon3.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8405">Doesn&#8217;t look too intimidating, now does it?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The other day a contract (i.e. side quest) asked me to investigate Imperial Testing Station No. 10, which is located to the far east of my current area. So I stocked up on ammo, bandages and water, mounted my sandbike and got going.</p>\n<p>The entrance (seen above) looks pretty much exactly like that of Station No. 2, so I thought I knew what to expect. And I did&#8230;but, as it would soon turn out, not really.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests these places are (or were) facilities for scientific or military research, and past the entrance they lie completely underground. Hence you have to go down some pretty steep and long ramps at first.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8406" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8406 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon4.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8406">Good thing I&#8217;m not claustrophobic</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I could soon tell that the enemies here are tougher and more numerous than I was used to, and I had to fight tooth and nail from the get-go. Many of them have a Holtzman shield now (to be fair, so have I), and most packs have at least one heavy gunner, who wield some kind of gatling gun.</p>\n<p>Fortunately my usual tactic of aggroing a group, then backtracking a bit and hiding behind something or around a corner works even better in the tight confines of these stations. This way the guys with melee weapons will sprint after you first, and you can hopefully dispatch them with your own knife or sword before their homies catch up.</p>\n<p>I also made generous use of grenades and turrets, and generally kept kiting and using cover as much as I could.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8407" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8407 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8407">Some of these shots were actually taken someplace else&#8230;I had more pressing things to do than sightseeing!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I was so tense and focused the whole time that I didn&#8217;t pay attention to how long I was at it already, but after a while it dawned on me&#8230;this thing just kept going, and going, and going still.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for me you can&#8217;t really get lost down there (I hate mazes with a passion). Sometimes a path branches off, but one of the two options always leads to a dead end soon, so there&#8217;s effectively only one way you can go. At least that wasn&#8217;t a concern.</p>\n<p>But what if I&#8217;d died? I&#8217;m not sure how quickly enemies respawn, but it&#8217;s seemingly something like 10-15 minutes. Which means that I would have had to fight my way down here again all the way from the top.</p>\n<p>Then I remembered that one of the things you can craft on the fly, provided you have the resources on hand, is a placeable respawn beacon. By then I had looted enough scrap metal to make a couple, so I plopped one down right away, just to be safe.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8408" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8408 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon6.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8408">How big <strong>is</strong> this place?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Deeper and deeper I went, with no end in sight. Aside from loot chests and enemies &#8211; of whom I&#8217;d probably dispatched nearly fifty by now &#8211; I found various audio recordings providing the place&#8217;s backstory. Don&#8217;t ask me about that though, for I was much too focused on the path ahead of me to actually listen.</p>\n<p>To make things even more tense my supply of ammo and bandages had started to noticably wane by now. You find that stuff left and right, but I was consuming even more than I got. About time to finish this, I thought.</p>\n<p>Then I <em>finally</em> came to a door with a green energy barrier, which I assumed had to lead into the boss room.</p>\n<p>You see, such barriers are usually red at first, unless you have already found the corresponding &#8216;identification band&#8217;. I hadn&#8217;t picked up any kind of key during my whole run, so why was this one green? Ah, but I&#8217;d seen this before, in Testing Station No. 2! As soon as I&#8217;d walked through the door there it turned red and wouldn&#8217;t let me get out until the boss was dead.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8409" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8409 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon7.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8409">Looks so inviting&#8230;should say &#8220;DANGER AHEAD&#8221; instead!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I placed a new respawn beacon right in front of the door, checked my weapons and bandages one last time, and went in.</p>\n<p>I found myself in a large, two-story hangar of sorts, and immediately had to fight for my life. I used the same tactics as before and dispatched the first batch of enemies, then another one. While doing so I noticed someone shooting at me from quite a distance&#8230;sniper! I tried to always have something between us while fighting the others, but still got hit once, and all of a sudden I was poisoned.</p>\n<p>I started losing health fast while still fighting some other guy. Luckily I managed to finish him off quickly and applied a bandage right away. I don&#8217;t know if that stopped the poison or if it had just worn off by then, but my health bar turned from green to red again and I could heal up to full normally. Phew.</p>\n<p>Using every bit of cover I could find I then got near enough for the sniper to switch to a different weapon, but I just made short work of him with my knife.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8410" style="width: 1208px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8410 size-full" height="771" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon8.jpg" width="1208" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8410">The slow blade penetrates the shield!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I had assumed the sniper to be the boss, but apparently not. By now the contract had updated its objective to &#8220;Kill Inna Hiller&#8221;, and that wasn&#8217;t checked off yet.</p>\n<p>The hangar&#8217;s upper level was clear now, but the doors (plural because there&#8217;s one at both ends) were still red, so I went downstairs &#8211; only to get instantly perforated by a heavy gunner. Seriously, I went from full shields and health to dead in like three seconds, tops. Guess I&#8217;d found the boss, eh?</p>\n<p>I respawned on my beacon and went in again. I had learned by now that Holtzman shields are turned off whenever the wearer fires a ranged weapon, but considering how quickly I&#8217;d died I wanted her not to shoot <em>me</em> of course. So I tried to get her to start firing, only to immediately take cover and let my grenades and turret do the work, which, after a while, did the trick. Phew again. But what&#8217;s that? This wasn&#8217;t Inna Hiller either?!?</p>\n<p>At least the doors were green now, so on to the next room. This one was much smaller, but also with some opportunities to take cover. To my relief these four enemies didn&#8217;t pose much of a problem, and now the contract was finally completed. Phew the third.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8411" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8411 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon9.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8411">Loot on the right, ID band on the left (the tiny purple ring)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I looted the super chest (more about those another time), and to my extreme delight the key that lay right next to it indeed led to a shortcut back to the surface, just as I&#8217;d hoped the whole time. This, too, seems to be a standard feature of these stations, and I think it&#8217;s great design.</p>\n<p>And so my first proper dungeon run in Dune: Awakening had come to a victorious close.</p>\n<p>To tell you the truth, I&#8217;m absolutely sure that I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten anywhere near the boss fight(s), let alone beat those, without the aforementioned grenades. These aren&#8217;t consumables that you buy or craft and then equip like in most games, but come from the Trooper skill <em>Explosive Grenade</em>. If you play the game and haven&#8217;t already, I highly suggest to unlock that and give it a try. It&#8217;s <em>so</em> helpful! If you have a Technique-slot to spare also use <em>Battle Hardened</em> to reduce its cooldown a little (as well as that of all other Trooper skills, including the grappling hook).</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8412" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon10.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8412 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dungeon10.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8412">My work is done!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I&#8217;m not exaggerating when I say that it&#8217;s been a very, <em>very</em> long time since I had a solo PvE experience as gripping as this one.</p>\n<p>Now, do I want every session to be like this? Hell no! Those one and a half hours (or however long it actually was) left me completely exhausted. But I was also exhilarated, and so very pleased with myself at the end! Games that can make me feel like that are a rare breed these days, so hats off to you, Funcom!</p>\n<p>Oh, and as if all of this hadn&#8217;t been enough excitement for a day I came <em>this</em> close to getting swallowed by a sandworm while collecting screenshots for this post.

In the case of Valheim, fellow bloggers like <a href="https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/search/label/Valheim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bhagpuss</a> and <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/category/valheim/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wilhelm</a> made it sound quite fun, too.</p>\n<p>I, however, played none of them despite all the praise they got. The very idea of having to take care of a character who needs to eat and drink, who can be too hot or too cold, and/or who also needs shelter lest the faintest of breezes kills him within seconds, just sounded like the antithesis of fun to me. I’m pretty sure that I actually tried a game with similar mechanics a long time ago…I can’t for the life of me remember what it was, but my vague memories of it aren’t fond either way.</p>\n<p>The thing is though, these games usually <em>do</em> have a whole bunch of features and characteristics that very much appeal to me, namely exploration, resource gathering, crafting and, above all, base building. Which is why, despite said dislike of survival mechanics, I’ve always eyed them curiously from the sidelines.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8370 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions2.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Hence when I started to read really good things about <em>Dune: Awakening</em>, for example over at <a href="https://chasingdings.com/category/mmos/dune-awakening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chasing Dings!</a>, <a href="https://www.heartlessgamer.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heartless Gamer</a> and <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/search/label/Dune%20Awakening" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Friendly Necromancer</a>, an ever growing desire to try it out took hold of me. Next thing I know is that I’m watching various videos about the game on YouTube, and once I see what players are capable of doing with its base building system I can’t resist any longer.</p>\n<p>Thus I finally decided to harden up and add some spice to my gaming diet &#8211; literally.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that I’ve only played about fifteen hours up to now, so these are going to be impressions of just the early game. To give you the bottom line up front though: I&#8217;m really digging it so far.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8371 size-full" height="278" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions3.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with why I chose this game over the others.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m not the biggest Dune fan ever &#8211; I&#8217;ve actually yet to read the novels &#8211; I quite like the first movie as well as the new ones. In terms of aesthetics and vibe the Denis Villeneuve films really are something else, and the game is very much based on those. The story takes place in an alternate timeline, but one that&#8217;s pretty interesting.</p>\n<p>Specific IP aside, I&#8217;ll take a futuristic, or shall we say &#8216;technologically advanced&#8217; setting over fantasy, dark ages or some such any day of the week.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the game looks freaking awesome. I&#8217;m by no means a graphics-snob, but here the high level of detail and realism really help to get the feel from the movies across.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8372 size-full" height="298" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions4.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read my ramblings about <i>ArcheAge</i> or <i>The Secret World</i> you know that I love me a flexible skill system. Not only does Dune: Awakening have that, you can actually unlock <i>all</i> classes on one character.</p>\n<p>You accumulate a crapton of skillpoints over time, too. I assume that it won&#8217;t be enough to unlock absolutely everything, but it seems that you&#8217;ll at the very least be able to create the combat build of your choice while also having all traversal skills as well as the various passives to gather more resources, consume less durability and so on active at the same time.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t like your build anymore or find that you&#8217;ve missed something important, fret not. Respeccing the whole thing can be done every 48 hours and doesn&#8217;t cost a thing.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8373 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions5.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Speaking of traversal, holy macaroni, the game is really fun in this regard, even before you&#8217;ve built any of the awesome vehicles.</p>\n<p>Spread across the classes you can unlock a grappling hook, an extremely fast sprint and an anti-gravity-bubble, and there’s also an equippable hover-device to either craft or loot. While these are already great on their own their real strenght comes into play when combined. For example, use the hook to propel yourself up a cliff, then press Space in mid-air to hover, and your momentum will carry you much higher or further.</p>\n<p>Getting up and down the game&#8217;s mountains, some of which being actually pretty high (and falling damage is a thing of course), becomes quite easy once you get the hang of it. And also, like I said, a lot of fun.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8374 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions6.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>As of yet I&#8217;ve only managed to build the smallest of the vehicles, the sandbike seen above. Even with only tier one parts it’s already much faster than running, and since the game world is anything but small owning one speeds up resource gathering trips or bandit base raids considerably. To no-one’s surprise it&#8217;s also a hoot to drive.</p>\n<p>My next goal is the sand buggy. The name is a bit misleading I feel, because it&#8217;s actually more like a hauler with lots of carrying capacity and built-in mining laser. A gatherer&#8217;s wet dream, in other words.</p>\n<p>The Ornithopters, of which there are three variants, should be the most fun of course, but those will probably take me a good while to get.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8375 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions7.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>Resource acquisition comes in various flavors.</p>\n<p>Whenever you&#8217;re in an area where specific stuff can be found, some of it just lies on the ground here and there, waiting to be picked up. The amounts you get that way are pretty negligible though, even early on.</p>\n<p>What you&#8217;re really after is resource nodes. Those usually look like a big rock, clump or stack made out of the material in question. Scan these nodes with your mining tool and then cut along the blue line that appears to break them and get a good chunk of the stuff.</p>\n<p>Once you’re able to build a dew scythe you can collect water from plants, but early on most of this precious resource will come from siphoning off dead opponents’ blood and purifying it. The next step up the ladder will be to dissolve whole corpses in some kind of high-tech sarcophagus (I kid you not).</p>\n<p>Collecting Spice has again its own mechanics, but I&#8217;ll talk about that when I&#8217;ve experienced it myself.</p>\n<p>Overall I like how resource acquisition works in this game quite a lot. Since looting dead enemies and their bases, shipwrecks and research stations is yet another way to get your hands on valuable stuff there&#8217;s much variety here, so things shouldn&#8217;t get boring too quickly.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8376 size-full" height="293" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions8.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>This is my first base, and it&#8217;s obviously crap. I hastily slapped the first iteration of it down while the sun was scorching me, and instead of starting over from scratch at night I just kept adding to it whenever I needed more space. I didn&#8217;t know yet that <em>all</em> of the resources are refunded when you tear something down again, which is really great as it incentivises trying stuff out and also takes the sting out of relocating.</p>\n<p>Which will probably happen a couple of times, so this one is temporary anyway. I&#8217;ll design something better &#8211; hopefully much better &#8211; for my main base, once I know where I actually want to build that.</p>\n<p>Provided I’ll find an open spot there, that is &#8211; this <i>is</i> open world housing after all. It seems to me that there&#8217;s lots of space to go around though, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, the building system itself is pretty spiffy and, like I said, some folks have done ridiculously cool stuff with it already.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8377 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressions9.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So what about the survival mechanics then?</p>\n<p>To my surprise I&#8217;m totally fine with them. I would actually go as far as saying that I prefer them being in the game just the way they are, instead of having none at all. Why? Because they add a little bit of tension and thus a sense of danger and adventure, while in reality not being <i>that</i> dangerous after all.</p>\n<p>You see, there is no hunger, so all you need is water, and that&#8217;s not really much of a problem right from the start. Sure, you can&#8217;t outright ignore it, but the game doesn&#8217;t make it overly hard for you to stay alive.</p>\n<p>Freezing at night ain&#8217;t a thing, but sunstroke sure is. To avoid that you only need to find yourself a bit of shadow though, so that&#8217;s usually not a big problem. Even if you do overheat, all that happens is that your hydration wanes much faster, and, again, you quite quickly get to a point where water reserves become more or less a non-issue (for your body at least; it seems that higher tier crafting will require tons of it, too).</p>\n<p>Aside from that there&#8217;s sandstorms and, of course, Shai-Hulud, aka sandworms. I don’t know yet how that might change later on, but in the starting area avoiding both is a concern, but not hard to do at all.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressionsx.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8378 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/firstimpressionsx.jpg" width="525" /></a></p>\n<p>So, yeah, all things considered I really like what this game has to offer so far, and I haven’t even talked about crafting or combat yet as this is already getting long as it is.</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">To me Dune: Awakening is more than the sum of its parts anyway.

The way he switches from Marc Spector to Steven Grant or vice versa in a heartbeat, completely changing his accent and speech melody, as well as his whole demeanor and body language, is nothing short of amazing. Sometimes you can see the transition in his eyes alone! I liked him as an actor before, but this performance easily made him one of my favourites.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;m a big fan of ancient egyptian mythology, Moon Knight&#8217;s adventures also get bonus points from me for their themes and setting.

Unlike some other heroes he isn&#8217;t more or less locked into either melee or ranged combat, as he&#8217;s got various abilities of both flavors at his disposal. He can even morph some of them into one or the other via his talents and traits, which are unlocked from level 32 onward.</p>\n<p>When fighting up close he uses weapons like truncheons, nunchucks and a bo staff, while depending on his signature crescent blades for ranged combat. Strangely, some skills have him shoot those blades out of a pair of pistols. I don&#8217;t know how that&#8217;s supposed to work, but I assume that it&#8217;s canon.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8308" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8308 size-full" height="308" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight2.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8308">&#8220;Did he just throw the gun??&#8221; Well, not exactly&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>His unique resource is called <em>Khonshu&#8217;s Favor</em>. It starts out empty, and some abilities build it up over time. Once at 100% he can use either of two spenders (or both at the same time if specced for it), which completely depletes all favor and gives him big buffs for quite a while.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s great about this is that most of his skills need no resources whatsoever, so you can basically use everything off cooldown, and spam those that don&#8217;t have one endlessly.</p>\n<p>His signature ability is a barrage of very quick attacks with a big finisher at the end. This one, too, can be switched between melee and ranged, and while the former does more damage I prefer the latter as it&#8217;s much easier (and also safer) to use. You can &#8220;weave&#8221; it around a bit if you&#8217;re quick, but in essence it&#8217;s a single-target skill, which is quite unusual for a signature. The upside is that it literally melts bosses&#8230;well, not <em>literally</em>, but&#8230;you know what I mean&#8230;and that&#8217;s a trade-off I&#8217;m very willing to make.</p>\n<p>His Ultimate, however, is by no means lacking in room clearing capability, as it peppers a pretty large area with gunfire and rockets for 20 seconds straight. You can still move and attack with your other skills in the meantime, too.

I believe they doubled down on this when they released the BUE (Biggest Update Ever) in January &#8217;17, and while that patch was met with a ton of criticism by the playerbase as well, I think they did a good job in this regard at the very least.</p>\n<p>I also really like how much control I have over each character&#8217;s specific playstyle. The aforementioned traits &#8211; it&#8217;s basically a talent tree that lets you choose one out of three options every few levels &#8211; offer more substantial alterations to a hero&#8217;s kit than most games do. Said switching between melee and ranged capabilities, or giving an attack a huge damage boost and additional DoT in exchange for a longer cooldown are just a few examples.</p>\n<p>Granted, I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface so far, what with 58 more heroes waiting to be played. But, again, the ones I have given a shot are really unique and fun, and Moon Knight is no exception.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8310" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8310 size-full" height="355" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/moonknight4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8310">&#8220;What are we wearing??&#8221; &#8220;She said I needed a suit.&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, the ceremonial armor from Khonshu&#8217;s temple, not psycho Colonel Sanders!&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Basically the only thing that he&#8217;s lacking is a high-quality costume based on his signature armor from the show &#8211; which is no surprise of course, as the game was shut down five years before that even came out. Fortunately the one I&#8217;m wearing on all screenshots seen in this post, based on Steven Grant&#8217;s version of MK (known as &#8220;Mr. Knight&#8221;, I believe), comes pretty close to the one Oscar Isaac wears when Steven&#8217;s in charge, so that&#8217;s at least something.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s enough for today.

I&#8217;m pedantic, but not <em>that</em> pedantic.</p>\n<p>But still, in my opinion rewards you only get if you do something, even if it&#8217;s just logging in, <em>aren&#8217;t</em> free.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8278" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz20.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8278 size-full" height="289" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz20.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8278">It&#8217;s lying! Even the top row isn&#8217;t &#8220;free&#8221;, it just doesn&#8217;t cost any real money</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The idea for this post came to me when I recently watched someone review other players&#8217; <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> accounts (yep, that&#8217;s a thing in gacha game circles). Several times during the video the host says that this character or that weapon should totally be leveled up to the maximum because &#8220;it&#8217;s a free power upgrade&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve played any gacha game before I don&#8217;t need to tell you this, but in case you haven&#8217;t: the resources to level stuff up are far from being free!</p>\n<p>Now, I know what they <em>mean</em> by saying that. To farm for things in this type of game you need stamina (in ZZZ it&#8217;s called battery charge), which replenishes on its own over time. So, <em>technically speaking</em>, given enough time you have a virtually unlimited amount at your disposal, which of course cannot be said about gacha currency, hence the distinction.</p>\n<p>However, in reality there&#8217;s quite a bunch of caveats to calling those upgrade mats &#8220;free&#8221;.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8279" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8279 size-full" height="270" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8279">I sure as hell didn&#8217;t get all this just because I&#8217;m such a nice guy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For one, your stamina pool always has a cap. Usually it&#8217;s 24 hours worth of recharge, sometimes even less, which means that you have to spend it very regularly in order to use as much as the game is willing to hand out to you.</p>\n<p>More importantly though, to spend stamina you actually have to, you know, <em>do stuff</em>. I mean, that goes without saying, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>Now, granted, in ZZZ I can burn six hours&#8217; worth of battery in about ten seconds if I&#8217;m in a hurry (or actually need and want just the most basic of materials), but even that can become a chore if done each and every day. Hell, spending my stamina in <em>Genshin Impact</em> became such a burden after a while that I had to <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2021/08/24/oh-boy-here-we-go-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quit playing altogether</a> for a long time. But to my point, even if stuff like this <em>does</em> only take a couple of minutes each day &#8211; that&#8217;s still not fricking <em>free</em>!</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8280" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8280 size-full" height="295" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8280">Even adopting a cute cat was <strong>a lot</strong> of work, believe you me</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But what about rewards I get just for logging in &#8211; those are surely freebies, aren&#8217;t they?</p>\n<p>Well, here&#8217;s the thing. The idea behind all of this, whether it&#8217;s &#8220;only&#8221; farming a bunch of stages for a couple of minutes or even &#8220;just&#8221; logging in, is that at least <em>some</em> players will not immediately log out again. <em>Since I&#8217;m already here</em>, they might say to themselves, <em>maybe I&#8217;ll also take a quick peek at the new event</em>, or whatever. And before they know it they&#8217;ve spent an hour or more in the game. And <em>time</em>, seemingly contrary to some people&#8217;s opinion, is neither free nor without value.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the incentive to log in can be so big that it might lead to stuff happening that you didn&#8217;t actually want to happen at all. Here&#8217;s an example. A couple of weeks ago an email informed me about ZZZ celebrating its first anniversary by gifting everyone an S-rank character and weapon of their choosing from the standard pool.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to play that game anymore (I even <a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/06/06/eight-years-of-blogging-about-mostly-old-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said so</a> not too long ago), but this? Well, guess what&#8230;I re-installed and patched up the ~70 GB client, claimed the &#8220;free&#8221; stuff and then thought to myself, well, now I kinda want to try them out, and let&#8217;s have a look at what&#8217;s new in the game, too, and&#8230;sure enough I went and played the game for many hours over the following couple of weeks.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8281" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8281 size-full" height="283" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8281">They sure know how to tug those heartstrings</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As long as I&#8217;m having fun that&#8217;s not actually a bad thing though, is it?</p>\n<p>Not really, no. Playing the story chapters I&#8217;d missed, visiting new areas and doing some events really <em>was</em> quite fun. However, considering that I&#8217;d much rather play <em>Marvel Heroes</em> right now, the fact that they&#8217;ve managed to pull me back in, and that I now feel almost obligated &#8211; again &#8211; to at least log in and spend some battery every day (and tend to my video store, and hang out with my agents, and&#8230;see what I mean?) does bug me quite a bit.</p>\n<p>And, yeah, that&#8217;s completely on me, I do realize that. Nobody <em>forces</em> me to do anything. I know for a fact that I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s susceptible to these practices though &#8211; which is exactly why they exist in the first place of course. That&#8217;s why we should stop pretending (or actually believing) that it&#8217;s all completely harmless, and that game developers give so much stuff away solely out of the kindness of their hearts.</p>\n<p>That all being said, I&#8217;m not here to tell you that you shouldn&#8217;t enjoy collecting login rewards, spending your stamina or whatever. If those things make you happy and don&#8217;t lure you into spending your time on gameplay you don&#8217;t actually fancy doing, more power to you.</p>\n<p>But please, let&#8217;s stop calling stuff <em>free</em> when it actually isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Blaugust 2025 post count: 3</span></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/08/11/most-free-stuff-actually-isnt/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/437dcc44b8a84b55b593db055be0b2ad5e4f7270a3a8d9b83303bcaa0310d98d?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/blaugust2025-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz20.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz21.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz22.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/zzz23.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}

For example, I still quite enjoy <em>Punisher: War Zone</em> (rest in peace, Ray Stevenson), and just the other day I had an absolute blast with 2018&#8217;s <em>Venom</em> once again.</p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;d just hit level cap with the Punisher in <em>Marvel Heroes</em> I thought, well, what better time to give everyone&#8217;s favourite symbiote a spin. Boy, what a great decision that was.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8249" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8249 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8249">WE are Venom!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Like many heroes (or villains&#8230;depending on who you ask, I guess) he has his own mechanics and special resource to go along with it. Actually he has <em>two</em> resources to manage, because some of his abilities consume his own hitpoints, and also deal more damage the less he has left. To make permanently running around on low health feasible he&#8217;s a pretty tanky dude, and I&#8217;m looking forward to how this feels at higher levels.</p>\n<p>His unique resource is called <em>Ichor</em>, and it looks the part. Yuck. Thankfully it starts at full when you enter a level, unlike, say, Scarlet Witch&#8217;s <em>Chaos Energy</em>, which has to be built up first (I don&#8217;t know her full kit though, so take this with a grain of salt).</p>\n<p>Consequently you can go all-in right from the start, spending Ichor as well as hitpoints galore. As long as you weave in abilities that recharge at least one or the other, depending on what you need, you should be good.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8250" style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8250 size-full" height="1080" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg" width="1920" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8250">Have a nice life</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Most importantly, it plays well, and also looks and feels really great. It&#8217;s hard to get good screenshots of it, because his powers move so damn fast and twitchy (as they should), but I hope it comes across at least somewhat on the ones I&#8217;m showing here.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8251" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8251 size-full" height="330" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8251">So many snacks, so little time</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Having played a new (to me) hero for a couple of hours now has also highlighted some more aspects of the game where the developers went the extra mile to make each of them unique and fun.</p>\n<p>For example, every character has a basic movement ability right from the start. It&#8217;s basically a short dash, meant to get out of harm&#8217;s way quickly. The Punisher does a forward roll, Captain America lunges with his shield held in front of him, Venom shoots a tendril of ichor and then pulls himself after it. Some are too lazy to move on their own and just teleport.</p>\n<p>It gets really crazy at level 10 though, when everyone gets their &#8220;travel power&#8221;. These aren&#8217;t for combat (they even have a short cast-time), but they&#8217;re a godsend for traversing the huge maps quickly. And I mean <em>quickly</em>. I really wish every ARPG had something like this, because not only takes it the sting out of any backtracking you might have to do, it&#8217;s also <em>fun as hell</em>!</p>\n<p>Cap and the Punisher just sprint really fast, Blade, Wolverine and Ghost Rider&#8230;well, ride their motorbikes, while Iron Man, Wanda and others fricking <em>fly</em> (Ant-Man rides a flying ant of course)! It&#8217;s not just for show either. While they can&#8217;t go over higher obstacles like freight containers or buildings, getting to another floor level or from rooftop to rooftop without taking the stairs or bridges is no problem. And as for Venom, well&#8230;</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8252" style="width: 525px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8252 size-full" height="310" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg" width="525" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8252">Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Holy macarony, how awesome is <em>that</em>?

Mechanically it&#8217;s the same as flying, so bonus points for that.</p>\n<p>Of course each hero also has their own lore-appropriate ultimate ability.\xa0 Iron Man activates the <em>House Party Protocol</em>, the Punisher calls in an armored and armed-to-the-teeth van that would make B.A. Baracus blush, and Cap&#8230;take a guess&#8230;<em>AVENGERS ASSEMBLE</em>!</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re really powerful, too. To balance that they have a whopping 10 minute cooldown to begin with, but you can shave that down to 7 or so (I think) by upgrading it.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8253" style="width: 1237px;"><a href="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8253 size-full" height="726" src="https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom6.jpg" width="1237" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-8253">Hell yeah, THAT&#8217;S what I&#8217;m talking about</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another cute tidbit is how heroes automatically talk to each other when they meet in the hub areas. When I&#8217;m standing around with the Punisher and an Iron Man walks by, my guy says &#8220;You should stick to making the hardware, Stark, not using it!&#8221;, for example.</p>\n<p>Sure, stuff like that can get repetitive after a while, but I usually can&#8217;t help but chuckle at the amount of snark these guys have for one another. I wonder whether this is where the <em>Overwatch</em> devs took their inspiration from, because those heroes do it in quite a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>Now you&#8217;ll have to excuse me though, those bad guys aren&#8217;t gonna bite off their heads themselves&#8230;</p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Blaugust 2025 post count: 2</span></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/2025/08/05/with-great-power-comes-great-fun/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/437dcc44b8a84b55b593db055be0b2ad5e4f7270a3a8d9b83303bcaa0310d98d?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom4.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom5.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://mailvaltar.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/venom6.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}]}
