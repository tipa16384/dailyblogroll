The game already started badly: In classical JRPG fashion, there is a sort of tutorial to teach you about the world, your place in it, and the basics of gameplay. And that tutorial is 4 hours long, unless you skip all that endless dialogue and exposition. It doesn\'t help that a good chunk of that time is taken up by black loading screens; they are only a few seconds long, but they happen extremely often. A real throwback to the time of PS2 and PS3 titles.<div><br /></div><div>Finally I got into the city and the real game began with me being introduced to the calendar system. This was new to me, as I haven\'t played any of the Persona games. I was told that I had 10 days until some calamity struck, so I had to finish a certain dungeon by that time. No problem, I thought, as the preparation before that, including doing city quests to reach Wisdom 2, which opened up the purification feature and a side dungeon quest, only took a few days. So I entered the main dungeon, and was starting to have fun. 8 hours later I had finished both the side dungeon and the main story dungeon before the time limit, when the game decided to slap me in the face and told me that I did it wrong.</div><div><br /></div><div>You see, these dungeons have "rest" areas called Magla Hollows. But you can\'t actually rest there, only save the game and do some dialogue. They don\'t fill up your magic points, which are the main limiting resource in dungeon runs. However, then the game introduced me to the option of using the Magla Hollow or other save points (in the form of a cat) to teleport back to the entrance. From there I could exit back into the city, rest properly in a tavern, and then get back into the dungeon, teleporting right back to the Magla Hollow. Great! Basically exchange a calendar day for a mana refill. Should be fine, as long as I don\'t need more days than the time limit. <b>Wrong!</b> It turned out after the dungeon that you get any calendar days not used in the dungeon as free days, which you can use to increase your virtues, bonds with other characters, do quests, or grind. These free days are extremely valuable, especially at the start of the game. And I had basically wasted them, by using the outside rest option whenever my mana was a bit low, instead of wringing the maximum out of each magic point.</div><div><br /></div><div>For me, good game design has failing forward options: If you aren\'t doing that well, the game should help you along in order to not fail at later, even more difficult challenges. Metaphor Refantazio reminds me of Valkyria Chronicles in as far as these games have failing backwards systems: They make the game easier for you if you played in a specific developer-intended "perfect" way, and punish you if you play casually, try out things, and are "inefficient" by very specific metrics. That is especially galling if you either need knowledge from previous games or guides, or get the information about what you should have done later in the game, and should basically replay parts of it "optimally" to get the best rewards.</div><div><br /></div><div>So I read some guides and tips about Metaphor Refantazio, and was told something I otherwise would have learned only much later in the game: Each character has an ultimate archetype, but you can only play that one, if you ranked up very specific archetypes throughout the game. If you are again playing casually, and try out a wide variety of archetypes on each character for fun, you might get to a point where you simply don\'t have the time to still level the archetypes you need high enough to fulfill the conditions for the ultimate archetype. Unless you use a very specific exploit that allows you to farm infinite amounts of archetype xp. So, hey, I\'m kind of happy that my Game Pass subscription ends in a week, and I won\'t be able to reach the end of Metaphor Refantazio anyway. Because if I have the choice of playing a RPG either for maximum fun while trying out a lot of things, or for maximum efficiency, I\'ll always choose the fun. Even if the game at some point would tell me that now I can\'t finish the game, due to all the accumulated penalties for not playing perfectly. I call that bad game design.</div><div><br /></div><div>Apart from the failing backwards design, Metaphor Refantazio is fun enough in a very classical way. It does look a bit old-fashioned, compared to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which I just played recently. But the archetype system and the turn-based combat are all very entertaining. The story and world aren\'t half bad, although again a bit more classical: In my 12 hours I did fight a lot of wolves, goblins, skeletons, and a minotaur, but also a few more original monsters, weirdly called "humans".

And it becomes immediately obvious to me that when I play the same faction as somebody on YouTube, we have the same quests. And regardless of faction, we have the same sequence of monsoons and tidefall, increasing the landmass over the course of the game. That makes me happy that I am trying this on Game Pass, and didn\'t pay $50 for it. Because I really don\'t want to have the same problem again that I already had with Civ 7: A scripted 4X game, where the repetition of the script in each game significantly lowers replayability for me.<div><br /></div><div>Now I completely understand the interest of this sort of game design. In a first game of Civ 7, it is interesting when the game changes, and you suddenly have to explore a new world. In a first game of Endless Legend 2, it is interesting when your coastal city is suddenly landlocked. 4X games without any scripts or events can become monotonous, as you have to rely on emergent narrative. The problem is that I don\'t buy 4X games to play them only once. My ideal 4X game is Age of Wonders 4, where I have such a huge selection of choices on setting up the game, that there is endless replayability. In comparison, Endless Legend 2, despite the "endless" in the name, isn\'t endless at all. If you play Endless Legend 2 five times, you have seen all five asymmetric factions and their quest lines, and the 6th game is necessarily rather similar to one of those first five.</div><div><br /></div><div>Don\'t get me wrong. Endless Legend 2 is a very competent and fun game, especially if you consider that it is still early access. And maybe you only want to play a few games, and five very different factions are enough for you. But my experience with Civ 7 was that the structure of the ages, and wanting to do all legacy paths in order to have the bonuses for the next age, resulted in all of my games having a very similar flow. I liked Civ 7 a lot in the first few games I played it, but lost interest in it much faster than with less scripted 4X games. I also found that the script in both Civ 7 and Endless Legend 2 limits your choices: Civ 7 didn\'t have a pangea map at release, because that doesn\'t work with the new world mechanic; Endless Legend 2 necessarily has a lot of water on the initial map, otherwise tidefall wouldn\'t make sense.</div><div><br /></div><div>I guess your impression of Endless Legend 2 will depend a lot on how often you usually replay a 4X game. For me, a game with less replayability is totally fine on Game Pass, where I don\'t get permanent access to the game anyway, and DLC are a problem. For Age of Wonders 4 I much prefer the game on Steam, where I just bought the third expansion pass for it, and the game is permanently installed on my hard drive.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'I am playing my first game of Endless Legend 2, while also watching YouTube videos about the game.

Because I really don\'t want to have the same problem again that I already had with Civ 7: A scripted 4X game, where the repetition of the script in each game significantly lowers replayability for me.<div><br /></div><div>Now I completely understand the interest of this sort of game design. In a first game of Civ 7, it is interesting when the game changes, and you suddenly have to explore a new world. In a first game of Endless Legend 2, it is interesting when your coastal city is suddenly landlocked. 4X games without any scripts or events can become monotonous, as you have to rely on emergent narrative. The problem is that I don\'t buy 4X games to play them only once. My ideal 4X game is Age of Wonders 4, where I have such a huge selection of choices on setting up the game, that there is endless replayability. In comparison, Endless Legend 2, despite the "endless" in the name, isn\'t endless at all. If you play Endless Legend 2 five times, you have seen all five asymmetric factions and their quest lines, and the 6th game is necessarily rather similar to one of those first five.</div><div><br /></div><div>Don\'t get me wrong. Endless Legend 2 is a very competent and fun game, especially if you consider that it is still early access. And maybe you only want to play a few games, and five very different factions are enough for you. But my experience with Civ 7 was that the structure of the ages, and wanting to do all legacy paths in order to have the bonuses for the next age, resulted in all of my games having a very similar flow. I liked Civ 7 a lot in the first few games I played it, but lost interest in it much faster than with less scripted 4X games. I also found that the script in both Civ 7 and Endless Legend 2 limits your choices: Civ 7 didn\'t have a pangea map at release, because that doesn\'t work with the new world mechanic; Endless Legend 2 necessarily has a lot of water on the initial map, otherwise tidefall wouldn\'t make sense.</div><div><br /></div><div>I guess your impression of Endless Legend 2 will depend a lot on how often you usually replay a 4X game. For me, a game with less replayability is totally fine on Game Pass, where I don\'t get permanent access to the game anyway, and DLC are a problem. For Age of Wonders 4 I much prefer the game on Steam, where I just bought the third expansion pass for it, and the game is permanently installed on my hard drive.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/1332719096534064979/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/1332719096534064979', 'title': '3 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/1332719096534064979'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/1332719096534064979'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/10/scripting-in-4x-games.html', 'title': 'Scripting in 4X games'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '3'}

So even if I found a mod solution for this particular game, I do hope that adding QTE to turn-based combat doesn\'t become a trend.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/3253258334253284929/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/3253258334253284929', 'title': '3 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/3253258334253284929'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/3253258334253284929'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/in-praise-of-mods.html', 'title': 'In praise of mods'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '3'}

Videogames are a bit different: People use other words, like complex, or "difficult to learn", to describe a game like Europa Universalis. But calling a videogame just "difficult" in the overwhelming majority of cases means only one thing: The game demanding a very fast reaction time, and you not being able to progress if you aren\'t fast enough. Search Google for "the most difficult videogames", and all results will be about games that are hard to beat because of reaction time.</div><div><br /></div><div>There is a problem with that sort of difficulty. If the difficulty of a game lies in its complexity, that is something that can be overcome by studying the game. But for reaction time, there is a hard cap, which is biological. I could train reaction time for days, and not get below a certain threshold. And that threshold is age-dependent. The scientific link between age and reaction time is well established, and I as a 60-year old pensioner can\'t possibly beat a teenager in reaction time, regardless of amount of training. And I think game companies haven\'t realized how their audience is aging.</div><div><br /></div><div>One of the famous game critics that complained about Silksong\'s difficulty was&nbsp;Yahtzee Croshaw from Second Wind. He is famous as a game critic because he has been doing the same style of game criticism for 18 years now, and has been involved in computer games even longer. He is now 42 years old. I would bet that two decades ago, he would have had an easier time beating Silksong, and his review would have looked differently.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first video game I ever played was Pong, so that must have been in the late 70\'s. But even the kids who grew up with far more modern consoles, like the Nintendo Entertainment System from the 80\'s, or the Playstation 1 from the 90\'s, aren\'t young anymore either. And a lot of us are still playing computer games. The general assumption, based more on the toy market than on the videogame market, that the audience remains young because older people stop playing, simply isn\'t true.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is further complicated by economic realities. Older people have always had more money than younger people, because they had the time to accumulate wealth or experience that translates into higher salaries. But these days there is an additional effect of rising inequality, which means that a large percentage of young people these days are poorer than previous generations were. Thus we get reports on how <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/video-games-spending-by-young-americans-is-dropping-sharply-report-suggests" target="_blank">video game spending by 18-24 year-old Americans has declined almost 25% over the last year</a>, much more than for older age groups. The $80 triple-A game simply isn\'t affordable for many young people.</div><div><br /></div><div>I didn\'t buy Silksong. I never would have, regardless of ratings. It was very obvious to me, even before the discussion on the game\'s difficulty, that I wouldn\'t have the reaction time to enjoy playing this. In fact, I haven\'t played a platformer for decades now, as the overwhelming majority of these games are now simply too hard for me. That wasn\'t always the case, 40 years ago I finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Miner" target="_blank">Manic Miner</a> on the ZX Spectrum, which was the really, really difficult platformer game of the day. I am able to afford $80 games, in fact I pre-ordered the premium edition of Europa Universalis 5 for €85. That is because EU5 does not have any feature by which my slow reaction time would lock me out of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now Silksong certainly doesn\'t have an affordability problem, and thus works well as a game targeted at a younger audience. But I can\'t help but feel that many large computer game companies didn\'t get the memo. The first Final Fantasy game was released in 1987, but most people who played it at that time wouldn\'t enjoy the latest release, Final Fantasy XVI, because the series has morphed from a turn-based RPG to an action RPG. The majority of triple-A game releases of the past years requires the audience to be able to meet a certain reaction time requirement. Very few games have a slider to slow that requirement down. If the people who can afford $80 games can\'t play them, because they are too old and too slow, while the people who can play these games can\'t afford to buy them, the industry has a problem.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'When last weekend I wrote about the pricing controversy over Silksong, Bigeye said that he had thought that I was writing about the *other* Silksong controversy, about the difficulty of the game.

But even the kids who grew up with far more modern consoles, like the Nintendo Entertainment System from the 80\'s, or the Playstation 1 from the 90\'s, aren\'t young anymore either. And a lot of us are still playing computer games. The general assumption, based more on the toy market than on the videogame market, that the audience remains young because older people stop playing, simply isn\'t true.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is further complicated by economic realities. Older people have always had more money than younger people, because they had the time to accumulate wealth or experience that translates into higher salaries. But these days there is an additional effect of rising inequality, which means that a large percentage of young people these days are poorer than previous generations were. Thus we get reports on how <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/video-games-spending-by-young-americans-is-dropping-sharply-report-suggests" target="_blank">video game spending by 18-24 year-old Americans has declined almost 25% over the last year</a>, much more than for older age groups. The $80 triple-A game simply isn\'t affordable for many young people.</div><div><br /></div><div>I didn\'t buy Silksong. I never would have, regardless of ratings. It was very obvious to me, even before the discussion on the game\'s difficulty, that I wouldn\'t have the reaction time to enjoy playing this. In fact, I haven\'t played a platformer for decades now, as the overwhelming majority of these games are now simply too hard for me. That wasn\'t always the case, 40 years ago I finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Miner" target="_blank">Manic Miner</a> on the ZX Spectrum, which was the really, really difficult platformer game of the day. I am able to afford $80 games, in fact I pre-ordered the premium edition of Europa Universalis 5 for €85. That is because EU5 does not have any feature by which my slow reaction time would lock me out of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now Silksong certainly doesn\'t have an affordability problem, and thus works well as a game targeted at a younger audience. But I can\'t help but feel that many large computer game companies didn\'t get the memo. The first Final Fantasy game was released in 1987, but most people who played it at that time wouldn\'t enjoy the latest release, Final Fantasy XVI, because the series has morphed from a turn-based RPG to an action RPG. The majority of triple-A game releases of the past years requires the audience to be able to meet a certain reaction time requirement. Very few games have a slider to slow that requirement down. If the people who can afford $80 games can\'t play them, because they are too old and too slow, while the people who can play these games can\'t afford to buy them, the industry has a problem.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/6105216691331663852/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/6105216691331663852', 'title': '6 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6105216691331663852'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/6105216691331663852'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/are-modern-games-made-for-right-audience.html', 'title': 'Are modern games made for the right audience?'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '6'}

That video said that I have been playing World of Tanks for 14 years. Well, not really. I first played World of Tanks 14 years ago. I have been playing World of Tanks for over a thousand hours, but there were a lot more years in which I didn\'t play the game at all than years in which I did play.

My apologies if I am conflating changes that happened over those 5 years with changes that the version 2.0 introduced.</div><div><br /></div><div>It is completely unsurprising that a 14-year old online game is well past its prime. There are no official numbers, but estimates from various sources, based on various data collected by players about players. When I played last at the height of the pandemic, there were an estimate 7.5 million players in World of Tanks, and while the pandemic slowed the decline, the game was already well past its growth phase. Before the release of WoT 2.0, estimated player numbers were down to 2.5 million, and we don\'t have numbers yet how much the new version was able to revive.</div><div><br /></div><div>Declining player numbers not only pose a financial problem to Wargaming, the company running the game. It also poses a financial problem to a number of YouTube channels that have dedicated their channel to World of Tanks content. Fewer players means fewer potential viewers, which means less revenue from content creation. And of course the content creators each have their own idea why World of Tanks is declining, and frequently blame Wargaming for some decision or other. This is also somewhat typical for YouTube: If you run a channel for a game and don\'t frequently criticize the game, you will be seen as a shill. Also the occasional <i>"World of Tanks is dying"</i> sensationalist / controversial video is good for viewer numbers, as controversy gets more clicks than <i>"this is fine"</i> content.</div><div><br /></div><div>So while Wargaming was mostly concerned how to monetize the remaining players, many YouTube channels were complaining about that monetization. That went as far as some channels organizing a "boycott", in which they wouldn\'t review the tanks from loot boxes. Unsurprisingly, Wargaming wasn\'t amused, and removed content creator privileges from the YouTubers complaining the loudest. Which didn\'t make the content on YouTube about World of Tanks any more positive.</div><div><br /></div><div>World of Tanks has, and always had, a slower pace than other online shooters. Especially with heavier tanks at higher tiers and with players using terrain and cover well, a lot of shots simply didn\'t penetrate armor. Which kept tanks alive longer, and led to matches being up to 15 minutes long. Now on the one side, Wargaming felt that a faster game would attract more players. On the other side, Wargaming wanted to sell stuff to players, like premium tanks and premium ammunition. So over the years, power creep occurred: The tanks today penetrate armor a lot more often, due to players using premium "Pay2Win" features. In addition, one of the major changes in World of Tanks 2.0 is an "armor flashlight", that makes it easier for less experienced players to see where the armor of the enemy is weak and can be penetrated.</div><div><br /></div><div>Between that, and the drive to get players back, or new players into the game, veterans of World of Tanks aren\'t happy: Too many people in a typical battle aren\'t very experienced, and play in a more YOLO style, which has become more viable due to that power creep. Thus battles are now much faster, often last only around 5 minutes, and feel very different to the more careful style the veterans are used to. Thus an increasing number of World of Tank content creators are just ranting about the game these days, which doesn\'t really help to promote it, and contributes to the downward spiral. Which also reduces their own viewer numbers. A video 5 years ago from Quickybaby about the best starting tech tree got 692k views, while an equivalent video from 2 weeks ago about which free tech tree to pick only got 255k views. It is pretty obvious that the World of Tanks ecosystem is not in a good shape. The game company and the content creators all make a lot less money than a few years ago, and often blame each other for that.</div><div><br /></div><div>Undoubtedly related to declining player numbers and the resulting matchmaking problems is the fact that World of Tanks today has a lot more PvE parts than it had 5 years ago, when I played last. Today, unless you turn it off, your first battles every day are PvE battles against bots. And why would you turn that off, when you are more likely to win against bots than against real players, and you get full credits and xp for those wins, they just don\'t affect ranking. There are also a number of PvE events, and a badly defined "new player protection mode", in which new players are again more likely to face bots as enemies, or other newer players, and are protected from "seal clubbing", as the practice of veteran players farming new players for xp and credits was known.</div><div><br /></div><div>But while the increase of PvE actually makes World of Tanks more attractive to me, I don\'t think I will play WoT 2.0 a lot.

There are too many other games I could play instead which would be more fun.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/2672083396735838972/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/2672083396735838972', 'title': '5 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/2672083396735838972'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/2672083396735838972'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-complex-ecosystem-of-world-of-tanks.html', 'title': 'The complex ecosystem of World of Tanks'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '5'}

On the one side, the growing threat produced by the improved Pandemic System is a perfect fit for the growing threat of Sauron in The Lord of the Rings. Also the group being split up all over the map of Middle Earth is an obvious fit to the story. On the other side of things, the game cleverly references the memorable scenes of the books / movies by turning them into quests. On my first game, I was playing Gandalf the Grey, and I had to go to Moria, confront the Balrog, and come back as Gandalf the White. There is a good selection of different quests for different characters, only Frodo having to throw the One Ring into Mount Doom is always the final quest to win the game.

My main point of criticism of the game is that it includes a cardboard dice tower; that adds a lot to table presence, but it is somewhat fiddly to put together, and you have to partially disassemble it to put it back into the box. As you often only throw 3 dice or less, it seems like an unnecessary cost element to me, although some other people absolutely love that thing.

But there being no hidden information opens the game up to the risk of one alpha gamer trying to boss around everybody else at the table to do what he says. Fate needs cooperation, but one needs to balance that with the need for player agency. I guess it depends very much on your gaming group. A group that is working very well together can potentially play Fate at a higher player count of 4 or 5; for most groups 2 or 3 players is probably safer. Also a matter of personal preference is your acceptance of luck in a game. Random characters having to do random quests means that different games can be very different in difficulty; the random nature of the shadow cards can also produce spikes of difficulty, or just ruin your plans by a bad luck draw.

They envision a future with elements from films like The Terminator, or A Space Odyssey, where AI becomes self-aware, super-intelligent, and intent on oppressing or wiping out humans. I don\'t think any of that will happen during my lifetime, armed robots simply aren\'t really a thing yet. In 2025 there is a possibility, albeit a small one, that you get killed by an AI-driven car. But we don\'t even have enough data, enough widespread adoption, and enough standardized AI driving technology that we could even say whether an AI driver kills more or less people than a human driver. The large language model generative AI from software like ChatGPT can kill people indirectly by causing mental harm, e.g. encouraging suicide, but that is still very far from a Terminator future.<div><br /></div><div>In the medium term, a much more realistic fear of AI is that of a disruption of the jobs market through artificial intelligence. The nature of work will change somewhat if companies move towards a wider adoption of AI. New jobs will emerge, but some old jobs will disappear. If you never heard anybody describing his job as "Vibe Coding Cleanup Specialist", that is because that job didn\'t exist before AI. Today it does, but the company hiring him is probably hiring fewer regular coders.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe there is a much bigger short term risk of AI, but I will have to precede my thoughts with a "this is not financial advice" disclaimer. Stock markets are at an all time high. The S&amp;P 500 is now over 40% tech stocks, and most of those tech stocks are heavily invested in artificial intelligence. There is at least a non-zero probability that there is an AI bubble, that investors overestimated the gains companies can make with AI over the coming years, and that the bubble could burst when these gains don\'t get realized as fast as they thought. How does that work?</div><div><br /></div><div>What one needs to understand is the concept of market capitalization, market cap for short. For example Nvidia has&nbsp;24.4 billion shares outstanding, and these shares today trade at $177.75. If you multiply these two numbers, you get the Nvidia market cap of $4.3 trillion. The problem with the concept is that this is imaginary money. It would be impossible to exchange 24.4 billion shares of Nvidia for $4.3 trillion in cash, because the act of selling Nvidia shares would make the share price drop. The same is true for every other share. As long as more people want to buy these shares than there are for sale, stock prices rise. As soon as people want to sell and cash in, stock prices drop. If you bought Nvidia shares on January 1st 2023 for under $15 and sell them now for $177, you made a huge profit. If you buy Nvidia shares for $177 now, and in a year the stock price dropped by half, you would lose money on selling.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fundamentally, stock prices are correlated to what investors think the future of a company will look like. Recently OpenAI made a deal with Oracle to invest $300 billion in AI data centers built by Oracle. This raised the stock price of Oracle, but also of Nvidia, where Oracle would buy the chips for those data centers. If everything in this deal happens as announced, Oracle and Nvidia are expected to have higher revenue, and thus their stock prices rose on an expectation of that. But the future is uncertain, and this optimistic expectation of the future might just be plain wrong. OpenAI is actually losing money every year, and the $300 billion would have to come from investors. And then there is the practical difficulty of buying and powering that many data centers in just a few years. Once Nvidia has made the chips, sold them to Oracle, and Oracle has built the data centers, OpenAI still needs to figure out how to turn that $300 billion investment into a profitable revenue stream. With AI adoption by non-tech companies apparently slowing down, all that future profit isn\'t obvious.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe that stock markets are failing to price in the unintended consequences of the AI boom. For example, a lot of Americans have noticed their electricity prices going up, especially in regions where data centers have been built. Electricity is a regionally traded commodity, and if a lot of new electricity consumers go live, supply doesn\'t go up as fast as demand, and prices generally rise. That is a problem for AI data center owners, but also of all other industry using electricity, and of regular households.</div><div><br /></div><div>Another "unintended" consequence of AI is more unemployment. Where do the stock markets think the profits from AI will ultimately come from? The most straightforward way for a general company to make money with AI is to replace people by it, paying less for an "AI worker" than for the person who did the same job before. But if everybody has "lower labor cost", it also means that a lot of people are unemployed or earn a lot less. And these people are the customers for the companies on the stock market. We already see companies like McDonalds struggling because many of their customers are lower income households, and can\'t afford fast food anymore. If you directly translate aggregate lower labor cost into aggregate lower consumer spending, the future for some companies on the stock market looks a lot less rosy. Those aren\'t necessarily the same companies, e.g. Oracle does very little business with low income households. But right now a glorious AI future, whether it will happen or not, has already been priced into the stock price of the companies that might gain from it, and not yet into the stock price of the companies that would be at the losing end of that deal. I don\'t see McDonalds replacing a lot of its staff by AI, as AI isn\'t yet very good at flipping burgers.</div><div><br /></div><div>Investor optimism leads to overpriced stocks.&nbsp;"Irrational exuberance" in the words of Alan Greenspan. The price to earnings ratio of Nvidia is over 50, that of Oracle over 75. The historical average P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is between 10 and 20.&nbsp;Current S&amp;P 500 PE Ratio is over 30. So the most short term risk from artificial intelligence is not some version of the Terminator, but what is politely called a "stock market correction", where investors realize that AI isn\'t going to pay out *that* fast, and stock prices drop a lot, because suddenly more people are trying to sell their overpriced AI shares than there are people wanting to buy them. And that also affects people who simply invested in ETFs, or who have money in a 401k pension plan. That is not to say that AI isn\'t a technology that will make money in the future, it just might take longer, or the profits will go to different companies than investors think today. Just like the dot com bubble burst, and the internet is doing fine, the AI bubble can burst while AI still has a bright future. The Terminator isn\'t likely to shoot you anytime soon, but he might still take down your retirement fund.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'A lot of people are afraid of artificial intelligence.

The price to earnings ratio of Nvidia is over 50, that of Oracle over 75. The historical average P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is between 10 and 20.&nbsp;Current S&amp;P 500 PE Ratio is over 30. So the most short term risk from artificial intelligence is not some version of the Terminator, but what is politely called a "stock market correction", where investors realize that AI isn\'t going to pay out *that* fast, and stock prices drop a lot, because suddenly more people are trying to sell their overpriced AI shares than there are people wanting to buy them. And that also affects people who simply invested in ETFs, or who have money in a 401k pension plan. That is not to say that AI isn\'t a technology that will make money in the future, it just might take longer, or the profits will go to different companies than investors think today. Just like the dot com bubble burst, and the internet is doing fine, the AI bubble can burst while AI still has a bright future. The Terminator isn\'t likely to shoot you anytime soon, but he might still take down your retirement fund.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/3281612909107098373/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/3281612909107098373', 'title': '5 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/3281612909107098373'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/3281612909107098373'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/the-terminator-2025.html', 'title': 'The Terminator - 2025'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '5'}

Old school left, which is more concerned with economics than with identity. I believe that a huge number of problems of today\'s society could be solved by increasing minimum wage by a lot. I believe that universal basic income would be a good idea. I believe that the main source of the general feeling that everything is going downhill is the increase in inequality.<div><br /></div><div>Unfortunately I also feel that several of my deeply held left wing beliefs aren\'t shared by the modern left. Rosa Luxemburg once wrote: <i>"Freedom is always the freedom of the one who thinks differently"</i>. She said that freedom only for the members of one party, however numerous they might be, is no freedom at all. Voltaire\'s view on free speech was once summarized as <i>"I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."</i>, and that is also something I believe in. The correct course of action on disagreeing with somebody is to discuss with him, or agreeing to disagree, while accepting the validity of his concerns. In some previous posts on this subject I mentioned that from not believing that it was valid to hold a different opinion to bullets flying was only a small step. Yesterday the bullets did fly, and in the USA a prominent right wing activist was killed. That is not the sort of left wing activism I can believe in.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am sure that my opinion is going to be met with a lot of whataboutism. Right wing political violence exists, but I don\'t believe that this a is proper excuse for left wing political violence. And while over the past years right wing political violence was more often expressed in physical violence than left wing political violence, it has to be remarked that left wing political violence was often expressed in other forms: Cancel culture, social ostracism, public shaming. For a movement that is purportedly about tolerance, the left has turned into an increasingly intolerant and puritanical bunch. Martin Luther King\'s idea of <i>"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character"</i>&nbsp;today is by many on the left considered as insufficient; that color-blindness is considered to be racist. Too many people believe that two wrongs make a right, and that it is okay to shame children for being white, or shaming men for being heterosexual. The people who invented the term "hate speech" sure use a lot of it themselves, just directed at different identity groups.</div><div><br /></div><div>I don\'t believe that oppressing the oppressors is a viable path forward. You still end up with a society which has first class and second class citizens, and different degrees of freedom and justice for different folks, you just change who is in which group. Tax the rich is a great idea, kill the rich isn\'t, even if that person is the CEO of a health insurance company. Virtue signalling is often just a first step to justify any sort of mistreatment of the "less virtuous". Believing that your own side cannot do wrong, and that the other side cannot have any valid points blocks all meaningful paths forward and leads to violence. A society needs to work on the basis of debate and compromise; if one side rules by decree and the other side does opposition only by lawfare, the political process has collapsed.

Old school left, which is more concerned with economics than with identity. I believe that a huge number of problems of today\'s society could be solved by increasing minimum wage by a lot. I believe that universal basic income would be a good idea. I believe that the main source of the general feeling that everything is going downhill is the increase in inequality.<div><br /></div><div>Unfortunately I also feel that several of my deeply held left wing beliefs aren\'t shared by the modern left. Rosa Luxemburg once wrote: <i>"Freedom is always the freedom of the one who thinks differently"</i>. She said that freedom only for the members of one party, however numerous they might be, is no freedom at all. Voltaire\'s view on free speech was once summarized as <i>"I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."</i>, and that is also something I believe in. The correct course of action on disagreeing with somebody is to discuss with him, or agreeing to disagree, while accepting the validity of his concerns. In some previous posts on this subject I mentioned that from not believing that it was valid to hold a different opinion to bullets flying was only a small step. Yesterday the bullets did fly, and in the USA a prominent right wing activist was killed. That is not the sort of left wing activism I can believe in.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am sure that my opinion is going to be met with a lot of whataboutism.

Aeterna is less aggressive, but the area to fight over doesn\'t perfectly scale to player count, so it makes a big difference whether 4 players are fighting for 7 spots, or 3 players are fighting for 6 spots.</div><div><br /></div><div>Vantage kind of has the opposite problem: There isn\'t much interaction between players. Every player experiences his own story, separate from the others. If you play that with 4 to 6 people, although technically possible, it just takes very long between your turns. And it is hard for everybody to remember the situations of all players. With 2 or 3 players, your turn comes around often enough, and you can still take an interest in what is happening to the others.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/">Tobold\'s Blog</a></div>', 'links': [{'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/8603120679789300728/comments/default', 'title': 'Post Comments'}, {'rel': 'replies', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/5584578/8603120679789300728', 'title': '0 Comments'}, {'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/8603120679789300728'}, {'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5584578/posts/default/8603120679789300728'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/09/musings-on-board-game-player-counts.html', 'title': 'Musings on board game player counts'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Tobold', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/04354082945218389596', 'author': 'Tobold (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'width': '32', 'height': '32', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuM2C_Q8Unm48KFjOhhIlL6cXY_BsaPP_9V4MPjh-3titjEOTbbjHrUhJCRlIyRCKynCwAmVzZZdPDA34cXvAWFAH39LCloM3L_I8MuLIZvr0qbPfplh-5TGqKpq813gMY9cbh5tQ-yySfKmDHWbEjMPL-OQZnpnzO2tbdvDkcnUUiSic/s220/Tobold.jpg'}, 'thr_total': '0'}

People tend to think of Second Life as this weird little corner of the internet where sex crimes happen, thanks to its poor reputation in media: a space often misunderstood and reduced to headlines. In reality, it\'s home to designers, singers, choreographers, photographers, business owners, and a strong mix of diverse roleplay experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/39847fe2-9b7f-4421-ab87-bf8ed4e0b04f/Off+to+Italy+Shi.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">One of those roleplay communities is focused on Greek Life found on HBCU campuses. I am a proud member and one of the founders of one such organization, Alpha Omega Mu. Founded in 2007, AΩM has been a passion of mine off and on throughout the years. AΩM has deep roots in honoring the Divine Nine, a collection of African American sororities and fraternities that started in the United States in the 1800s, and our focus on charity is a core part of who we are. For 18 years, we have raised funds for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and have also contributed to other organizations’ charity drives. Since returning to Second Life three years ago, I’ve spent much of my time focused on growing a strong and thriving sisterhood. This year has come with growing pains, but we’ve shifted our focus and are aiming to put roleplay at the forefront of our organization.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">There is a thriving Greek Letter community in Second Life, and while I sometimes take issue with the wider community (a blog post for another day), I am often amazed by the ingenuity and creativity you can find within it. This past week really brought that home for me, as my organization helped fellow Greeks Kappa Theta Phi II with their fall vacation event, Chalet Valdoro Fall Festival. The week-long event focused on smaller roleplay activities, from wine tasting and horseback riding (which AΩM hosted) to scuba diving, karaoke, and even an actual horse derby. Each event gave participants the opportunity to get to know one another, crack a few jokes, and unwind. It offered everyone a chance to step away from the hustle and bustle of the real world and experience, in essence, a vacation they might not be able to afford or find time for otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/ac1c726a-3811-4cde-b158-0189d9358510/Valdoro+Air.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">It also gave me the chance to remember why my first foray into online gaming was virtual worlds and making connections. Over time, I have become less and less social. I\'ve always been shy, but over the last few years, I\'ve somewhat become a hermit. I stick to my group and only my group, rarely venturing into new experiences and heavily vetting anyone I deal with. And yes, when you think sorority, you think social butterflies, so I know there is a weird juxtaposition there, which is why this week has been huge for me. During our wine tasting event, we tried something new for AΩM with a “Hot Ones” style segment inspired by the YouTube series, and everyone loved it. Three other organizations have already said they want to join in next time since we plan to film future sessions and share them on social media. As a matter of fact, I spent much of this morning joking around with some of the other people staying at the resort on the dedicated Discord server. We\'ve talked about collaborating on another vacation event and working together on our upcoming charity drives. There has been a real building of community this week that reminds me it\'s okay to step outside your comfort zone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/3797d40c-f54d-456d-84f7-61288e34d897/Hot+Ones.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/8be48f08-8149-44b3-805e-a1ac80cf61c8/Brunch+Time.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class="\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            ">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt="" height="800" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/f3400f94-6f3d-46b2-9d7d-1f6475bdf87d/Crystal+Cave.png?format=1000w" width="800" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class="">Second Life is full of subcultures most people never see, and Greek life is one of its most enduring and creative. What this week reminded me is that behind every avatar, there’s a person looking for connection, laughter, and belonging. The bonds we build through roleplay might start as stories, but over time they become something very real. If you\'re curious about how organizations like Alpha Omega Mu operate, or want to learn more about Greek roleplay in Second Life, let me know in the comments. I’d love to share more about this side of the world in a future post.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1760050772090-M0870QX6B7U66AZ99ZXZ/Off+to+Italy.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

As we looked out over the bay, I was struck by two things: how vast this world is, and how I ended up here with these two men. They call me a friend, and I am still in awe of them. To listen to them honor one another was humbling. Though tonight their words were not meant for me, but for each other, I felt them all the same. The struggle to live up to what once was, to what others believe we should be, is a battle I know all too well.</p><p class="">Eight years of war have carried me to this place. The Broken Isles, Zandalar and Kul Tiras, the otherworldly Shadowlands, and the Dragon Isles. One battleground after another, each demanding more of me, more of us, but each leaving scars unique to the person. For me, there was no pause, no moment to breathe until now. Listening to Thrall and Anduin, I realize that in war, none of us walk free of the dead. We simply learn to live beside them.</p><p class="">For the first time I can feel the calm before the storm. There is a charge in the air, but the wind that carries it is gentle and warm. I do not know how long it will last. I wish it would last forever. I know it is foolish to think the fighting is over. Even when the battlefield falls silent, the war never truly ends. But in this quiet, I find myself yearning. Yearning to understand how I, a simple Farstrider from Quel’Thalas, ended up here. What was the moment? What was the choice?</p><p class="">And yet, it is silly of me to even ask those questions. I know the answer. I might be too afraid to speak them aloud, but I know them. Perhaps during this in-between, I should read some of my old journals, to look back with some perspective. They do say time helps to round out the edges. So maybe, in reading my journals, I can be gentler with my choices, and if not that, then maybe just gentler with myself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=""><em>Author’s Note:</em><br />This marks the start of Zanaia’s story. A quiet pause before she begins looking back on the choices that shaped her. This first journal entry takes place at the end of <em>The War Within</em> max-level campaign. The remaining journal entries will unfold alongside my playthrough of <em>Legion Remix,</em> tracing her path and the choices she made. For now, the plan is to write her story through <em>Legion.</em> After that, only time will tell.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/jpeg', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759708284120-B7JO818AWEK481F9PBKJ/Zanaia+Anduin+and+Thrall.jpg?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '1500', 'height': '844'}]}

And honestly? That feels amazing. Fun escapism is on the horizon, and I’m here for it.</p><h4>Legion Remix</h4><p class="">Aside from the power-leveling of alts and awesome rewards, I have a feeling there are a few reasons why this is one of the expansions they decided to remix. From what I understand, Legion was one of the more popular expansions, but the end of the expansion also has strong lore ties to what is going on currently. I feel like they want us to go back for the story, or at least I want to go back for the story, and I’m just hoping they want us to as well.</p><p class="">I also think this ties into why they did the Mists of Pandaria remix, which I unfortunately missed. After watching episode 5 of a lore and history series on YouTube, <em>Before the Mists: What was Pandaria really like?</em> from Quaylin, I’ve been thinking a lot about the Thunder King and all the lore and history in Pandaria. (Also, highly recommend that series if you like lore: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEyTJ3_GpaHRKIZ31190_-OuxCTfCafXZ&amp;si=b-EWYQynXZojo_0O" target="_blank">Quaylin’s Playlist</a>).</p><p class="">On top of that, I want to create a short story that might turn into something longer for a character I’ve had in the back of my mind. Most, if not all, of my WoW characters have a backstory, but there’s one story in particular I want to play around with. I’m hoping it’ll help get me back into writing creatively and also make me a better writer. You know, the whole “practice makes perfect” thing. The first in that series is coming out next week, and I’m pretty excited about it.</p><h4>Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity</h4><p class="">As most of my friends know, I adore Guild Wars 2. It has such rich and deep lore, plus it does a really great job of giving you the story via your hero panel if you’ve been away awhile and forgotten what you were up to. Kind of like a gaming bookmark. On top of that, the game is visually stunning, and they just do a lot of things well that I feel some games (<em>cough</em> World of Warcraft <em>cough</em>) take and use for their own. Warbands, I’m looking at you.</p><p class="">I also recently got some new friends into the game. It’s such a delight seeing new players enjoy Guild Wars 2. At first, one of my friends was like, <em>“Oh, I’ll play when you’re on.”</em> Then the next thing I know, they went out and started exploring on their own. I was so proud of them! They’re gamers, but MMOs haven’t really been their thing before. Sadly, Lost Ark was their first MMO, and I was like, <em>“Girl, that is not a game you want to start with.”</em></p><p class="">And of course, the Halloween event is right around the corner. In real life, I’m not the hugest Halloween fan, but there’s something about the Guild Wars 2 version that brings me so much joy. It’s campy and lighthearted, with just the right touch of spooky and decoration. It’s always a good time, and I’m really looking forward to experiencing it with my friends.</p><h4>Dispatch &amp; Anno 117</h4><p class="">I’m looking forward to Dispatch and Anno 117 for different but also similar reasons. They’re both the kinds of games I love to sink into when I’m feeling socially overwhelmed and want to game without any pressure.</p><p class=""><strong>Anno 117</strong> is a city builder (my absolute favorite genre) that will take us to the Roman Empire this time around. I can’t wait to experiment with creating a city that not only functions well but also looks beautiful.</p><p class=""><strong>Dispatch</strong>, on the other hand, is a story-driven, choices-matter RPG with a superhero twist. It features an incredible cast of actors, including two of my favorites from the voice acting world, Travis Willingham and Laura Bailey, as well as Jeffrey Wright. I LOVE Jeffrey Wright.</p><p class="">Both games are ones I know I’ll enjoy for months and months: replaying Dispatch to explore different choices, and perfecting the greatest city I can in Anno.</p><h4>WoW Player Housing</h4><p class="">I cannot even contain my excitement for player housing coming to WoW. I love to decorate in any game that lets me, which is why I adore city builders. Decorating scratches a creative itch for me since I can’t really do that in real life. HGTV is one of my all-time favorite channels, and I’ve basically been using games as my own personal HGTV show ever since The Sims 1 released.</p><p class="">The controls for decorating in WoW also look really similar to Second Life, which I have a lot of experience with. I even have an interior design business in SL, so I know I’ll be able to pull off some pretty amazing things. Once December 2nd rolls around, I’m going to be knee-deep in not only decorating my house but also leveling up the renown for it so I can have <em>all the things</em>!</p><p class="">I also plan to showcase myself decorating and the whole process that goes into it. That should be a lot of fun, kind of like a virtual MMO version of HGTV. Maybe that’ll be the moment I give YouTube another try… probably not, but at the very least I have this space to share all my design ideas.</p><h4>Countdown to Cozy Chaos</h4><p class="">So that is everything on the horizon until the end of the year. I haven’t had this much gaming content to bring me joy in such a long time. It’s hard not to be overwhelmed, but also it feels like being a kid waiting for their birthday or Christmas. Which is ironic because both my birthday and Christmas will be in the middle of all these things.</p><p class="">So if you need me between now and the holidays, you’ll find me happily lost in one of these worlds. Much excite, indeed.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759370554986-2X8R5BJOO4FD5A3AAJ7H/Much+Excite.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

To say I’ve blogged in the past would be an understatement. I’ve had several, all short lived, so we’ll see how this goes. Lately the quick bursts I toss on Mastodon don’t feel like enough. “But blogging? That’s so old school,” I hear you say. Yes, a blog. I know it’s 2025, but I don’t want to stream. Making YouTube videos isn’t on the table for now. So here we are. Fingers to keyboard, thoughts to screen.</p><p class="">So what is this place? Exactly what it says on the tin: a blog. A spot to pull together the ways I play, explore, and create in games. Sometimes that means roleplay stories where characters start writing themselves. Other times it’s screenshots that capture moments I want to hold onto. And sometimes it’s just me reflecting on the gaming experience, the joy, the chaos, the little obsessions of whatever I’m into that week.</p><p class="">My gaming tastes are all over the map, and that’s how I like it. One day I’m chasing achievements in Guild Wars 2. The next I’m running delves in World of Warcraft. Or desperately trying to keep the tiny people in Frostpunk from freezing to death. If it’s a world worth exploring or a puzzle worth figuring out, odds are I’ll end up there.</p><p class="">Ready Pixel One isn’t about guides or dissecting patch notes. It’s about what happens inside the games and inside my head while I play them. It’s the spark of a new MMO story, the random character I get too attached to, the screenshots I can’t stop taking. A mix of RP stories, personal reflections, and snapshots from the journey.</p><p class="">This first post is just me setting the stage. There’s more to come, characters to meet, worlds to visit, and plenty of pixels to share along the way.</p><p class="">So… Pixel One has joined the game.</p>'}], 'media_content': [{'type': 'image/png', 'url': 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/68dc8379e5e05a0185c364f1/1759292672837-C734CUZR5FF3N0TH5AYW/Ready+Pixel+One.png?format=1500w', 'medium': 'image', 'isdefault': 'true', 'width': '800', 'height': '800'}]}

It&#8217;s really easy to feel pressured when everyone else is doing the thing.

I\'ve actually managed to go off of hydrocodone. I can finally sleep on my side again. It\'s so nice. You don\'t know the value of your favorite sleeping position until you\'ve lost it. </span><br /><br /><span>When last we left me, I had rounded out four carboplatin and pemetrexed chemo infusions, and apparently . . . that\'s it for me. I asked the doctor for more chemo and he said no.  The most infusions they\'ll ever run is six, and the survival stats past four aren\'t good? It\'s confusing, but I trust the oncologist. Now I\'m simply running immunotherapy every three weeks.</span><br /><br /><span>That all said, man, it was so nice not to be poisoned this past Friday. This chemo does some really wild stuff to me mentally.  After the fourth dose, I wrote this note down when I was in the throes of it, <i>"There\'s a weird side effect to this chemo -- it\'s like having a quasi-hallucination, but more like a kind of a vivid, strange imagination. Just now I was able to clearly picture a girl with fiercely intense blue eyes that looked almost bird like. It\'s like a vividness to my dreams while I\'m awake (or half awake). There\'s a tingle to the world as you sit here slowly dying. Shutting down. Not caring. Hard to explain. Listlessness. That\'s what this chemo does to you."</i></span><br /><br /><span>Now that I\'m on immunotherapy only, it feels super easy in comparison. Sure, I was a little tired right afterwards, and my arms and scalp are dry and itchy, but that\'s nothing in comparison to how dark life got on days three-through-six after a carboplatin and pemetrexed infusion. </span><br /><br /><span>Apparently if my next CT scan shows even MORE improvement, then they might even consider moving me to a "stable disease" status, which is where they would cut down the amount of office visits and scans. I have to say that feels very weird, and I\'m not sure I like it. While the doctor would be happy with "stable," I want "cured." I guess when you have Stage 4 cancer, you get what you get and just be happy you\'re not dead, dummy. </span><br /><br /><span>I\'m hoping I\'m lucky and immunotherapy doesn\'t turn on me, and it does the trick. As ChatGPT put it to me, chemo was running a bulldozer through my body, and now immunotherapy is like putting the guard dogs out to attack cancer. </span><br /><br /><span>Everyone please keep sending those vibes my way. I don\'t care if they\'re prayers, meditations, or even spoken to the universe in your goofiest Count Chocula voice. You send it -- I\'ll take it.

I wasn\'t throwing up or anything, just had what felt like a big knot in my stomach.

I was back to work on Wednesday, but even then, I was in cold sweats all day and just generally feeling tired. Nausea hit me this time as well, which I wasn\'t expecting. I wasn\'t throwing up or anything, just had what felt like a big knot in my stomach. Kind of weird.</p><p>I was hoping to have a little music therapy on Friday as well, but my therapist cancelled because she was sick. Hopefully next time! Speaking of next time, upcoming next will be another CAT scan and more immunotherapy in just a couple of weeks. I\'m still doing my homeopathic stuff alongside my regular treatment, and I hope the upcoming scans show more improvements.</p><p>As for how I\'m physically feeling, I feel a little better, but I\'ve been having some smaller, more localized pains in my back and side. I\'m not sure if that\'s things getting better or worse.&nbsp; Hopefully better. We\'ll have to see.&nbsp; One thing is for sure, it\'s been nice being able to sleep on my side and with a pillow again.&nbsp;</p><p>I would appreciate the traditional thoughts, prayers, love, vibes, voodoo, mantras, and you-name-it for healing. I worry about this thing spreading. It\'s one of my main fears actually.&nbsp; That and the fear of a government shutdown next week, but we\'ll approach that if and when it happens.&nbsp;</p><p>Happy Dueling!</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/09/cancer-journey-and-real-life-update-for.html'}], 'link': 'https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/09/cancer-journey-and-real-life-update-for.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'Stingite', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (Stingite)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Stingite', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7CcdsGCOonhL6nMO_99_6egGefqONx_bY-550ZbYhT8CWCBliKPH_XqAjZp5eMvD1Nh7KwOvoc3ENywJ8gbVs9gqYON0Wl1Ls4dT6Con6Xtg08JK3YCEqcrZ9S5z1cQB3BHXnTPoT6h6g-iQLpk7XLWhTdYWOWQCBFC-UHRUh52ru5YPF_1h5lcLuYwU/s72-w300-h400-c/555533446_10237202137328762_162464513732312608_n.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '8'}

COVID and a quarantined reality solidly hit everyone in 2020. I was staying home and with extra time on my hands. My buddy at work had a group named Bueno Sueno and they had just released a song called Lost in the Shine. I convinced him to send me the stems and flexed my remixing muscles with a mix I called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgtQu2zECs">Tom Purdue Shimmer Mix</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That remix set off a bug in me, and I started remixing or remaking some deep cut songs that were meaningful to me in one way or another. Before I knew it, I had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vWqp7YBZE&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHpgc58cpOgeOQY7F_nR3h9S">whole playlist of remixes and remakes on YouTube</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Cetu Javu\'s Fight Without a Reason (Lifestyle Remix)</li><li>Morrissey\'s Now My Heart is Full (Bunny Love Remix)</li><li>Cabaret Voltaire\'s Code (Wah Guitar Mix)</li><li>The Cure\'s Night Like This (Deeper Still Mix)</li><li>Decussion Council\'s (yes, my old high school band) Don\'t Stop (Everyone Hang On Mix)</li><li>Tom Purdue\'s Bit by Bit (2020 Mix)</li></ul><p></p><p>I wrote about all of them in&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2020/06/mixtape-fire-my-past-month-in-flames.html">this blog post from June 2020</a>. As mentioned in that blog post, I formulated a plan to release a lathe print vinyl record with a very small print run . . . 4-5 copies through a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://americanvinylco.com/product-category/one-off-and-short-run-vinyl-records/">American Vinyl</a>. When I got the records back, I thought they sounded horrible. I hadn\'t mixed the songs considering volume levels and how they would actually play on a record player. I threw them in the garbage can in disgust.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, who is much smarter than me, saved them out of the garbage can and instead stashed them in a secret spot that I would only find later when we were moving from Texas back to Utah. (which . . . is a story all unto itself.) Turns out it was mostly the fault of our bad record player at the time. There were a few sub-bass hits on the Don\'t Stop mix that were just too low and distorted a bit, but that\'s it. The record sounds great.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/s4000/20240406_195749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/w185-h400/20240406_195749.jpg" width="185" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Not the white album, it\'s a Quarantined Mix Record from Tom Purdue!</i></p><p>For real though, the life as a rock star wannabe had become nothing more than a dusty, distant 30-year-old memory up until 2021 when a great guy named Adam Terry contacted me over Instagram holding both my Darkest America and Freeze tapes from back in 1990.

I\'ve never had anyone dump so many hours of their life just dedicated to listening to my music. Honestly, the real help from Adam has been feeling like someone actually cared about me as an artist enough to reach out and help me dust off the old tapes. While there may be a lot of sadness and regret from the past, his simple act of reaching out kind of unplugged so many things that I had bottled up over the years. That alone was appreciated.</p><p>From all that, Adam curated two albums of music.&nbsp; The first was just released last year. <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2024/03/an-ant-survives-rainstorm.html">As discussed in this post</a>:</p><p><i>"My new "old" album was released today by FOUNTAINavm.

After baptizing myself in all this music and having recently remade Bit by Bit for my Quarantined Mixes, I realized I could make a synthwave album of my own.</p><p>The end result was Red Pinto Hatchback, released in 2021. I actually made two posts about this one. One about the making of <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/09/red-pinto-hatchback-cover-art.html">the cover art</a>, and one <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2021/10/red-pinto-hatchback-launched.html">about the album release itself</a>. As I stated in that post:</p><p><i>". . . So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette. Truly, if you have a Walkman, I\'d love to get my music in there for you to enjoy on your new walk down old memory lane.</i></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/s3043/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/w640-h388/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" width="640" /></i></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>No school like the old school</i></p><p><i>I have to talk a bit about the title track to Rotted Leisure Rooms. It\'s a gritty industrial piece that features the synth work of David Kane. Back in 1988 I was watching 120 minutes on MTV when a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DiNYb20WY">Baby Doe Rules</a> by David Kane\'s Decay of the Western Civilization came on, and I recorded it on VHS tape. I asked every record shop I could find in Utah if they had it so I could listen to more, and no one knew what I was talking about.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Eventually I transferred the song off of VHS tape to audio tape so I could listen to it in my car. It was a rare track that no one knew. I think they played Baby Doe Rules only a handful of times late at night on MTV, but there was something about the raw sampled, industrial goodness of this track that in a way gave me permission to do the same. It was truly an inspirational track for me.</i></p><p><i>Just a year and a half ago, I found <a href="http://www.davidkanek-9.com/">David Kane\'s website</a> while remembering how influential this song was to me, and I reached out to tell him how much I enjoyed it. We traded several e-mails back and forth and somehow I convinced him to collaborate with me on this track. I\'ve enjoyed our chats and getting to know him better. Truly the best thing to come out of me making this music has already happened, and that was getting to collab with David."</i></p><p>So . . . that catches us up to August 2025 and there\'s been a lot holding me back once again:&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2024/04/whats-happened-where-have-i-been-and.html">Losing my job</a>, moving back to Utah, learning a new career, and <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/07/time-for-real-boss-fight-lung-cancer.html">being diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer</a>. I have lots of ideas for music, but haven\'t pursued them. I\'m stuck once again.</p><p>I\'ll snap out of it soon though. Adam Terry has been chatting me up again about releasing another collection of music -- he\'s just been busy running a local record shop in Salt Lake and pouring his whole life into it.&nbsp; If you\'re in Salt Lake, go checkout <a href="https://fountainrecordsslc.com/">Fountain Records</a>. It\'s a great shop. Support local folks like Adam and his wife, who are both simply awesome.

COVID and a quarantined reality solidly hit everyone in 2020. I was staying home and with extra time on my hands. My buddy at work had a group named Bueno Sueno and they had just released a song called Lost in the Shine. I convinced him to send me the stems and flexed my remixing muscles with a mix I called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgtQu2zECs">Tom Purdue Shimmer Mix</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That remix set off a bug in me, and I started remixing or remaking some deep cut songs that were meaningful to me in one way or another. Before I knew it, I had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vWqp7YBZE&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHpgc58cpOgeOQY7F_nR3h9S">whole playlist of remixes and remakes on YouTube</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Cetu Javu\'s Fight Without a Reason (Lifestyle Remix)</li><li>Morrissey\'s Now My Heart is Full (Bunny Love Remix)</li><li>Cabaret Voltaire\'s Code (Wah Guitar Mix)</li><li>The Cure\'s Night Like This (Deeper Still Mix)</li><li>Decussion Council\'s (yes, my old high school band) Don\'t Stop (Everyone Hang On Mix)</li><li>Tom Purdue\'s Bit by Bit (2020 Mix)</li></ul><p></p><p>I wrote about all of them in&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2020/06/mixtape-fire-my-past-month-in-flames.html">this blog post from June 2020</a>. As mentioned in that blog post, I formulated a plan to release a lathe print vinyl record with a very small print run . . . 4-5 copies through a company called&nbsp;<a href="https://americanvinylco.com/product-category/one-off-and-short-run-vinyl-records/">American Vinyl</a>. When I got the records back, I thought they sounded horrible. I hadn\'t mixed the songs considering volume levels and how they would actually play on a record player. I threw them in the garbage can in disgust.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, who is much smarter than me, saved them out of the garbage can and instead stashed them in a secret spot that I would only find later when we were moving from Texas back to Utah. (which . . . is a story all unto itself.) Turns out it was mostly the fault of our bad record player at the time. There were a few sub-bass hits on the Don\'t Stop mix that were just too low and distorted a bit, but that\'s it. The record sounds great.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/s4000/20240406_195749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI3zmDlklufi3Pbq_Zf70P1DwLiS54hVErvAB5MZknAckTcOxreYiKLtWT6MTcRH63WPMmszHqcHKAKvPOhT_5F77HJzGatllcQR6OsvvBW9WDOm89vCG4HVFgzhOdUnoZirDwfuth6SySK67dbuFoWfAcQRHHWeuzPzzRSdMuFe_1HCNjZz0IXtyZEOY/w185-h400/20240406_195749.jpg" width="185" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Not the white album, it\'s a Quarantined Mix Record from Tom Purdue!</i></p><p>For real though, the life as a rock star wannabe had become nothing more than a dusty, distant 30-year-old memory up until 2021 when a great guy named Adam Terry contacted me over Instagram holding both my Darkest America and Freeze tapes from back in 1990.

So many formative "musical" hours were spent driving around in my old Red Pinto Hatchback in the late 80\'s, listening to music, that it felt very apropos to immortalize it as my spacecraft in comic book form.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/s2048/Tompurdue.jpg" style="color: #3778cd; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjywt-F_KzIHLU2UKnNz7jFbxfr745SeHxpCeD7wTQWjKyXXrocxUuNQkGWoLNqMtA9HD2rL29MqcbEr6RpqGh4cY2kuYqAeoqe0k-F0LKIVJUiKeQ_xnF0JqtbKu_QTPy_4iDYgtb3QiE/w534-h640/Tompurdue.jpg" width="534" /></i></a><br /><i>A futuristic blast from my musical past</i></p><p><i>I paid for the distribution of this album through Distrokid, so you can find it on all kinds of sites now, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w2ImCU_BMU&amp;list=PLa010R2BpXHoYV7j7gAbIFD_H3NSJuEqg">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-pinto-hatchback/1585870783">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09G8MKHG3/tom-purdue">Amazon</a>, Tik Tok, and more. That\'s right, you can make a Tik Toks using my music. CRAZY!</i></p><p><i>. . .&nbsp;</i><i>The reactions I\'ve been getting from friends and family have been pretty fun to watch. One of the first people to contact me was my old musical ally, Sean. He played guitar on both of my Industrial albums and I played drums on a few of his tracks.&nbsp; I hadn\'t really heard much from him for years and he hit me up in DMs to let me know how fun it was to hear my music again and that it brought back a lot of great memories.</i></p><p><i>Even my sister-in-law was doing the good work and being proud of me, sharing the music around to her friends, and I have to say . . . promoting music is the hardest part of the process, and probably the part I tiptoe around the most. I know people get tired of hearing artists hype up their latest works because I also get tired of it when I see it myself. Making the music is challenging and fun but promoting it and not being annoying at the same time is a delicate balance that I\'m trying to swing."</i></p><p>After a couple years, my music interests had successfully reignited, and I was trying my hand at collaborating and failing at it a bit, save for one special collaboration. Talks with Adam about making Beat Tapes on old school audio tape gave me a great idea for making a collection of songs. As stated in my post about about <a href="https://tompurdue.blogspot.com/2023/03/rotted-leisure-rooms-by-tom-purdue.html">Rotted Leisure Rooms</a>:</p><p><i>"Over the past year and a half I started amassing a small collection of grooves that needed a wider audience than myself.&nbsp;I had three songs that came out of creative suggestions from my oldest child. Two more that spawned from discussions with old friends. Another that came from chatting with an old underground musical idol of mine from when I was in high school. And a handful of others that were just collecting digital dust. Out of all this comes my latest release titled "Rotted Leisure Rooms."&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Rotted Leisure Rooms is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0s8bksHnSBXzKhhpbdEe">available online</a> for you to listen to and download, but I also went old school and made a handful of audio tapes on beautiful, dungeon-brown-colored cassette. Truly, if you have a Walkman, I\'d love to get my music in there for you to enjoy on your new walk down old memory lane.</i></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/s3043/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><i><img border="0" height="388" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnQR10VL7PWAP4yUv9ttPnGoJWlCf1b7jPI6c1DyFYk-npxP_bW5sXhgL_JQXkA3LCfzSGNCe1v2dlnM5cd4l0W01nDwL2yCtxXR_I47JPsglygRTw7_vuQgowuQgroEarNMbRSqy7NKUsYY4ljgKtlB-xMzlXMF91aSHQe7zJzBHzgCLXCXjHfyUkj8/w640-h388/20230312_131452%5B2413%5D.jpg" width="640" /></i></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>No school like the old school</i></p><p><i>I have to talk a bit about the title track to Rotted Leisure Rooms. It\'s a gritty industrial piece that features the synth work of David Kane. Back in 1988 I was watching 120 minutes on MTV when a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0DiNYb20WY">Baby Doe Rules</a> by David Kane\'s Decay of the Western Civilization came on, and I recorded it on VHS tape. I asked every record shop I could find in Utah if they had it so I could listen to more, and no one knew what I was talking about.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Eventually I transferred the song off of VHS tape to audio tape so I could listen to it in my car. It was a rare track that no one knew. I think they played Baby Doe Rules only a handful of times late at night on MTV, but there was something about the raw sampled, industrial goodness of this track that in a way gave me permission to do the same. It was truly an inspirational track for me.</i></p><p><i>Just a year and a half ago, I found <a href="http://www.davidkanek-9.com/">David Kane\'s website</a> while remembering how influential this song was to me, and I reached out to tell him how much I enjoyed it. We traded several e-mails back and forth and somehow I convinced him to collaborate with me on this track. I\'ve enjoyed our chats and getting to know him better. Truly the best thing to come out of me making this music has already happened, and that was getting to collab with David."</i></p><p>So . . . that catches us up to August 2025 and there\'s been a lot holding me back once again:&nbsp;<a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2024/04/whats-happened-where-have-i-been-and.html">Losing my job</a>, moving back to Utah, learning a new career, and <a href="https://thefriendlynecromancer.blogspot.com/2025/07/time-for-real-boss-fight-lung-cancer.html">being diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer</a>. I have lots of ideas for music, but haven\'t pursued them. I\'m stuck once again.</p><p>I\'ll snap out of it soon though. Adam Terry has been chatting me up again about releasing another collection of music -- he\'s just been busy running a local record shop in Salt Lake and pouring his whole life into it.&nbsp; If you\'re in Salt Lake, go checkout <a href="https://fountainrecordsslc.com/">Fountain Records</a>. It\'s a great shop. Support local folks like Adam and his wife, who are both simply awesome. It\'s a cool scene in there for sure.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjdd18ZSFDF87ytcFh636GPZ4JttUUR_xHZkaTG5oP-Su6Xx-JtOOGQxrnZ65gvegiGUrNyB9xt_mXgr-MP1xGsp0SG9Wtk-SOgJw3NkXZN1ha1W-U425Q3QHF7uCCCCMEV25cQHwgTIWcB7a-fyfmKTSB7b1CDsYytdTPxnnwy14nR4VLFUnIGPpnO8gI" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjdd18ZSFDF87ytcFh636GPZ4JttUUR_xHZkaTG5oP-Su6Xx-JtOOGQxrnZ65gvegiGUrNyB9xt_mXgr-MP1xGsp0SG9Wtk-SOgJw3NkXZN1ha1W-U425Q3QHF7uCCCCMEV25cQHwgTIWcB7a-fyfmKTSB7b1CDsYytdTPxnnwy14nR4VLFUnIGPpnO8gI=w279-h320" width="279" /></a></div><br />Here\'s to the future!<p></p><p>Thanks for reading along with my musical history.

I was kind of reminded of an uglier version of Grummus from Everquest. That may be too esoteric of a reference for the kids. Anyway, at the end of the fight, you rip out her stomach.

At the time, my job was to work closely with an outsourcing team in Spain to build a vertical slice of a mobile game called Unnatural Selection (UNS). The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk.

Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build.

The object was to get a viable product out there as fast as possible, to put it out for public consumption, and to see how close to expected metrics it was. Most mobile games are failures, but if you can "fail fast," your company is at less risk.

Ryan Chapman and I were co-captains and decided to make UNSVR a reality. To be perfectly clear, the Unnatural Selection base game (whether on PC or Mobile) was originally Ryan\'s brainchild. Ryan had been dreaming of making a fish breeding game FOR YEARS. This game just wouldn\'t have happened without Ryan. That said, as the sole VR designer for the team (in this instance), I borrowed from the original pitch deck and created something more manageable for us to create in the span of seven days.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 14px;">I wrote up both a design document and a less pitch-oriented, design PowerPoint deck that would help us define the boundaries of our scope while keeping the original flavor of the game we wanted to build.

These short swords, or rather short spears, can be thrown to activate simple puzzles where energy passes between magic orbs and powers up unpowered spheres, unlocking doors and raising obstacles.</div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhK_M2xIo51JKGew-VW4lr79iJ_0KjOjXuryzOkUOHja7-6fJM58u_gQvTHmTUvaO9Cqo3zbICzozY8Kzkoxe_YcdMj8V5teQqwrpzyGdgqxZmMZObyHRTy09hDDcisqdDT7ZrZzobsqdhISITtY4rNMf0f19rcm3bEjjEW23oaO9VjH9-V1_9xIr5f_wE" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhK_M2xIo51JKGew-VW4lr79iJ_0KjOjXuryzOkUOHja7-6fJM58u_gQvTHmTUvaO9Cqo3zbICzozY8Kzkoxe_YcdMj8V5teQqwrpzyGdgqxZmMZObyHRTy09hDDcisqdDT7ZrZzobsqdhISITtY4rNMf0f19rcm3bEjjEW23oaO9VjH9-V1_9xIr5f_wE=w640-h640" width="640" /></a></div><i><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Raising the Hraenathra to power open a doorway</i></div></i><br /></div><div>The first companion Stikkan unlocks is an angry bear mama known as Bjornhild.

The game appears (and plays) like an aquatic combination of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/18/coffee-talk-review/">Coffee Talk</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/15/steamworld-dig-2-review/">SteamWorld Dig</a></em>, which are both games I very much enjoy. I downloaded <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> upon release on Switch, but it fell into my backlog until this year; in recent months, I&#8217;ve gotten around to properly playing through the game, and I&#8217;m glad I did so &#8211; not only does it deliver on the rewarding gameplay loop and sumptuous pixel art graphics I hoped for, but it&#8217;s been an ideal showcase for chilled handheld gaming on the Nintendo Switch 2!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting the review, I&#8217;d like to mention the brief controversy around <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, as I remember it adding unfair caution to my approach to the game. Back in 2023, the game was nominated for Best Indie Game at The Game Awards, which drew criticism because the game wasn&#8217;t an Indie game &#8211; the developer MINTROCKET was a subsidiary of Nexon, a lucrative South Korean company. The developers were not responsible for the game being nominated, and it appears that the nomination was based off of the pixel art graphics and relaxed alternative vibe of the game, instead of the literal definition of an independent company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/"><em>4Gamer</em></a>, the CEO of MINTROCKET &#8211; and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> creator &#8211; Jaeho Hwang said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">\n<p>“I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like a more detailed explanation and opinion, I highly recommend <a href="https://indiecator.org/2023/11/15/why-is-dave-the-diver-not-indie/">this post on <em>Indiecator</em> by MagiWasTaken</a>, which discusses the situation in better detail than I could in this short review introduction. Ironically, it&#8217;s since been announced in 2024 that MINTROCKET is becoming independent (albeit with support from Nexon to carry out the move). My main point is that this controversy is not something to think ill of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> or MINTROCKET for, and that allowed me to dive into the game fresh. Right, that&#8217;s enough preamble, so let&#8217;s get into the review!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Catch of the Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> follows the story of Dave and his friends, who&#8217;ve travelled to the oceanic Blue Hole to set up a sushi restaurant called Bancho Sushi (named after the head chef Bancho). As the title suggests, Dave must dive underwater to collect the fish and ingredients, and this forms the majority of the game &#8211; you must balance risk and reward as you collect as much as Dave can carry, whilst keeping track of your oxygen levels and means to get back to the surface &#8211; either by swimming back up, or finding an Escape Pod point. If you run out of oxygen and get stranded underwater, you lose all but one of your collected items, which severely impacts the success of the sushi restaurant in the evenings. This risk/reward system is reminiscent of the digging in <em>SteamWorld Dig</em>, and is implemented superbly here &#8211; the player has to make the tough decision between keeping what they&#8217;ve got, or risking pushing a little further and potentially losing it all. It&#8217;s a brilliant gameplay loop that keeps you coming back for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15160" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3751.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15140" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15139" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_01.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The game eases you in gently, starting with introducing the mechanics of catching fish at a relatively shallow depth. Your main weapon is the harpoon, which can be fired in front of you to reel in fish. However, there&#8217;s a delay whilst the fish struggles, which gives other dangerous creatures the time to close in on Dave &#8211; and later on, the harpoon requires multiple hits and/or extra button combinations to capture stronger fish. There are also various items to discover and collect, either as supplementary ingredients found in submerged cooking pots, or as materials scattered on the sea floor. Dave only has a certain amount they can hold at once, which quickly becomes reason to earn the Gold needed for upgrading your Cargo Box storage limit &#8211; as well as your Air Tank, Harpoon Gun, and more. In turn, this motivates the player for the sushi segments of the game; depending on how well the restaurant performs in the evenings, the more Gold you&#8217;ll earn for upgrades. Both sides of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> continue to ingeniously compliment each other in this way, as success in one helps you in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gameplay-wise, the sushi segments are rather different from the diving, and this is where my earlier comparison to <em>Coffee Talk</em> comes in. After setting sail to Bancho Sushi, you start by going through a list of your possible dishes to serve in your evening menu; your selection is based upon the fish you&#8217;ve caught and the ingredients you&#8217;ve acquired. The quality and quantity of your haul determines your success, as rarer fish open up more expensive dishes that result in a more lucrative evening. Upon selecting each dish, you can also enhance it if you have enough excess ingredients &#8211; a process given extra visual flair by the wonderful animated cutscenes of Bancho preparing the food. These animations aren&#8217;t limited to just Bancho, and are sprinkled throughout <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, such as when weapons expert Duff upgrades your guns. Each of these sequences has a tongue-in-cheek over-exaggerated tone, and add to the playful charm of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15133" height="360" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sushi_bar_6mb.gif?w=640" width="640" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in Bancho Sushi you can browse and sell your ingredients for quickfire Gold, as well as decorate the restaurant as you see fit, and even hire extra members of staff to help you out. The latter are essential, as over time the restaurant gets busier; once you open the restaurant, you control Dave as he serves dishes and maintains the restaurant, and hiring extra hands to help is key to success. Whether it&#8217;s pouring drinks, dashing around to serve sushi plates, cleaning up, or keeping Bancho well-stocked with sushi, this is a frenetic <em>Overcooked</em>-style part of the game that contrasts well with the diving. It&#8217;s certainly not as layered as the underwater gameplay, but it&#8217;s not supposed to be, and does a successful job at giving the player a break between each dive. Plus, it&#8217;s extremely satisfying to see the profits come in &#8211; which can then be spent on upgrades the next day, when the cycle begins anew&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Just Keep Swimming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this core gameplay loop, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> steadily introduces new characters and locations throughout the seven main story chapters. They&#8217;re an eclectic bunch, each with their own expertise and side quests. Archaeologist Dr. Bacon propels the main story forward; as you dive deeper, you discover much more than just fish, including secret civilizations and bigger ecological threats to the Blue Hole &#8211; the latter of which is tracked by the biologist Ellie, who gives you various collection tasks through the Ecowatcher app. Speaking of which, your progress is mostly tracked via these apps, which are accessed via the efficient menu on Dave&#8217;s smartphone. To give a few examples: you might use the phone to acquire and upgrade weapons (with the help of the aforementioned Duff); you might browse your snaps for photographer Udo; or you might look through your Pokémon-style Marinca collection for Sato, an Ash Ketchum lookalike!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15146" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3688.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15153" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3737.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15154" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3672.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Between all these characters and side quests, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> has something for everyone. If you like collecting then you can focus on filling out the Marinca (essentially a Pokédex for fish), if you like the sushi-management side you can focus on optimising your earnings, and if you like exploring then you can focus on the diving. Whichever way you play, <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> smartly manages to naturally push the story on regardless &#8211; for example, a character named Otto opens a farm partway into the game, where you can grow crops such as rice. Growing these ingredients helps you to reliably create more valuable dishes in the evening; but to help out Otto and subsequently build up the farm, you need to collect certain items, which requires becoming proficient at the diving. Each element of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> gently motivates the others in this way, and therefore pushes the player to test out every facet of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a side effect of this admirable gameplay variety is that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> occasionally inserts under-baked minigames or quick time events. One instance of this is the cooking competition side missions, where you must gather ingredients for Bancho as you normally would, but upon doing so, you must then engage in first-person cooking challenges. These consist of basic button presses and directional inputs, and feel like a rushed version of either a <em>Cooking Mama</em> or <em>Mario Party</em> minigame. It was the rare moment in <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> where I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15123" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3677.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15124" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3705.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15127" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3697.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15136" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nswitchds_davethediver_06_gben.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, some of these asides work better than others &#8211; a relatively quick soldering minigame is an enjoyable and brief inclusion, and there&#8217;s a compelling <em>Balatro</em>-style card game, but on the other hand, a one-time stealth sequence is particularly badly designed. These hiccups are rare enough that they don&#8217;t significantly detract from <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, but they were also noticeable enough that I had to mention them in this review. They just feel unnecessary &#8211; it&#8217;s as if <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> felt it had to extend itself beyond the main gameplay loop that it executes so superbly. If anything, the high quality of the core diving-and-sushi-selling gameplay only make the brief diversions more jarring.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Deadly Depths</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the various other side missions and gameplay mechanics, it&#8217;s the diving that&#8217;s understandably the focus of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, and it&#8217;s exceptionally well-balanced. As aforementioned, your initial harpoon is a unique weapon to master &#8211; but Dave can also carry one firearm, either by collecting them underwater or by crafting them beforehand. There&#8217;s a range of weapon types: you might use the Net Gun for catching large swathes of fish, or perhaps the Grenade Launcher for explosive damage, or even (my weapon of choice) the Sniper Rifle for long-range damage. The latter is especially handy when tackling sea life that is aggressive at close range, such as the many sharks patrolling the Blue Hole!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15161" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3700.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Dave isn&#8217;t just reeling in small fish. You&#8217;ll soon be fighting not only sharks, but hostile jellyfish, giant squids, and plenty more! Significant story events are often accompanied by a boss fight against a dangerous opponent such as these, introduced with stylish freeze frames reminiscent of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and signifying the stakes of the encounter. Additionally, new areas of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> can be a trial by fire, with enemies that suddenly reduce huge amounts of your oxygen supply (which doubles as a health bar of sorts) with a single hit. However, the challenge rarely felt unfair, and any failed dives were always down to my own mistakes &#8211; and only left me more motivated to improve my aquatic skills or upgrade my gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, as well as your harpoon and firearm, Dave can carry a melee weapon (also used for mining materials) and two pieces of equipment. The latter of these can vary, from battle items such as a proximity mine, to ways of helping Dave in a pinch, such as portable oxygen refills. Most of these can be found underwater, or alternatively, they can be pre-purchased from Cobra in the boat before starting your dive, adding another way for the player to customise their approach. Overall, there&#8217;s a well-judged balance between giving the player plenty of options, but not giving you so much power that you can become complacent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15142" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3664.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15172" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3745.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15168" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_screenshot_005.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when you feel comfortable with Dave and his toolset, the missions being asked of you often cleverly push you out of your comfort zone &#8211; and if you&#8217;re not careful, it doesn&#8217;t take much for a dangerous enemy or perilous area to derail your dive and leave you back at the boat almost empty-handed. It&#8217;s oh-so-easy to fall into the trap of completing just one more mission, collecting just one more item, capturing just one more fish &#8211; but equally, there&#8217;s an undeniable thrill to escaping just in time. In the later chapters, missions become more specific to match your increased skills, and particular ingredients can necessitate repeated captures of rare creatures. This cycle reminded me of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and similarly to that series, provides a tangible reason to keep capturing the most elusive fish &#8211; in this case, to find the rarest ingredients and compose the finest dishes at Bancho Sushi!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Under the Sea</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the endearing yet adventurous nature of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the graphical style; the gorgeous pixel-art invites you in, making diving a little deeper &#8211; and playing a little longer &#8211; even more enticing. The shallow regions are full of bright welcoming colours, but the variety only builds from here. Every layer under the water has a unique visual identity, such as the dark Blue Hole Depths, or the extreme cold and heat of later areas. Meanwhile, night-time dives feature a shining kaleidoscope of colourful foliage that feels magical to navigate &#8211; when you&#8217;re not being pursued by deadly fish, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15162" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3748.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the human character designs have a palpable sense of personality. This gets more spotlight in the earlier-mentioned animated cutscenes, which blend the stunning pixel art with the tongue-in-cheek humour that <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> does so well. By the end of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>, the roster of characters have a real sense of camaraderie between them, which contributes to that overall warm and relaxed feeling that the game has. Add in the detailed multitude of marine species and food recipes, and <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> really is a delectably beautiful game. Playing it on the large handheld screen <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/09/09/did-my-hopes-for-the-switch-2-become-a-reality/">of the Switch 2</a> has only accentuated this feeling further for me &#8211; and it&#8217;s been a great example for how that console helps the back catalogue of the original Switch to shine even brighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial compliment to the visuals of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is the music, which is often a wonderfully soothing backdrop to your deep sea exploration. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a notably therapeutic game when you’re just casually collecting fish, exploring the vast swathes of water, and listening to the delicate musical backdrop. My favourite piece of music is for a late-game frozen area, where these tranquil tones morph into a synth-style inspirational beat. Also, music fans will get an extra treat from a certain cameo appearance at Bancho Sushi, who comes complete with a musical performance that I’ve been listening to many times since! Not to be glossed over is the sound design, too &#8211; the sounds of marine life, the tense pull of a harpoon, the whooshing of waves, it all sounds authentic and distinct, and pulls you further into the watery world of <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15163" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3738.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15148" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_3659.jpg?w=863" width="863" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15150" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/davethediver_illust02.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the thing about this game &#8211; it reels you in, not necessarily in a sudden way, but a gradual one. As the in-game days go by, you settle more thoroughly into the gameplay loop, getting more familiar with characters old and new, until they become familiar friends on your adventure. There&#8217;s a sense of pleasing routine to checking your farms for crops and ingredients, then going diving and completing missions, before then preparing for the evening Bancho Sushi business. It&#8217;s a lot like the charm of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> or <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but with the added element of gripping underwater gameplay to go alongside it. The game is kept fresh by the steady incline of options and equipment available to Dave, and this creates an endgame with potentially endless longevity. Even when you finish all of the main story missions, you still have a restaurant business to run, and you can continue building it out to your hearts content. There&#8217;s extra DLC too, two of which (the <em>Dredge</em> and <em>Godzilla</em> tie-in packs) are free, for those looking for extra content!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a delight to play through <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. The mix of gripping gameplay and relaxing sushi simulation &#8211; combined with the incredible art direction and music &#8211; makes for an RPG full of endearing charm and well-meaning adventure. At its heart is whimsy and a sense of positivity, and that soaks through into every part of the game &#8211; and each part compliments the other in a wonderfully natural way. My only criticism is that this enthusiasm leads to the introduction of impromptu minigames and quick time events that sometimes feel underdeveloped in contrast to the main diving gameplay &#8211; but they&#8217;re few and far between, and a drop in the ocean compared to the sea of brilliance within <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em>. There&#8217;s brilliant longevity built in too &#8211; even after finishing the main story, the diving and sushi restaurant aspects remain, for those who&#8217;d like to continue building Bancho Sushi into the best restaurant it can be. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> is a treasure of a game, and it comes highly recommended from me!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center

This particular Direct was split into three distinct segments: first about the 40th Anniversary of Mario, then news for the original Nintendo Switch, and then finally information on the Switch 2 &#8211; and altogether it made for a barnstorming hour-long performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo has been on a run of brilliant Directs over the last few years, but this might genuinely be my favourite one for a long while. Many of the announcements in this Direct speak specifically to me and the games I have been looking forward to, and it&#8217;s genuinely made whittling my choices down to five a tough task! If you&#8217;d like to see the full Nintendo Direct, you can do so below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Honourable Mentions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of it being a tough task&#8230; With so much packed into the Direct, I am first going to run through some other announcements that I was glad or intrigued to see, but didn&#8217;t make the cut for the five announcements that appealed most to me personally. The Nintendo Direct started with several <em>Mario </em>announcements in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary: this included a trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> in 2026, as well as a collection of both <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> games for Nintendo Switch, coming October 2nd this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retrospectively, this does make <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/04/lets-chat-3d-mario-games-are-coming-to-switch-but-where-is-galaxy-2/">the decision not to include <em>Galaxy 2</em> in the <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> collection</a> feel very calculated. I personally will likely pass on this new release of the <em>Galaxy </em>games, as the £58.99 cost (or £33.99 separately) feels excessive &#8211; and whilst they are superb games, I doubt I&#8217;ll play them enough when there are so many other new games to play. I do, however, hope to get the physical <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOor7cl-qF_B_yaH1ketH1_ep2UqAIeMsULytGxbXaJ-8c79YpmKe">Rosalina&#8217;s Storybook</a> they are making, as that would be lovely to keep in the collection!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15028" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-collection.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15029" height="377" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-3rd-image.jpg?w=670" width="670" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15027" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15026" height="464" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/galaxy-2.jpg?w=834" width="834" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we got a release date of 4th December for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was great to have confirmed &#8211; and the only reason it isn&#8217;t in my main five picks below is that the new footage left me a bit hesitant. We got to see the new bike Samus will use to traverse the world, and there was something off about it &#8211; the world looked a bit too empty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The footage reminded me of the infamous Mako in the first <em>Mass Effect</em> game, which was also known for wide open spaces that felt empty and were awkward to navigate. Visually, the bike is very cool, and the first-person segments look fantastic, but I was surprised at the briefness of this new footage. I sincerely hope that isn&#8217;t a sign of a lack of confidence in the game; either way, eight years after the initial announcement, I remain very excited for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> to finally launch!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I&#8217;d like to give a mention to the <em>Pokémon</em> segment of the Direct. We got the announcement of a brand new spin-off game named <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, which looks like a mix between<em> Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Pokémon</em>, where you play as a Ditto-turned-human (whether this is charming or horrific, you decide)! This game probably won&#8217;t be for me, but I envisage it being very popular, by blending life-sim mechanics with the popularity of the world of <em>Pokémon</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, we got more info for the soon-to-be-released <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, showing off new Mega Evolutions; this segment ended with an announcement of the upcoming <em>Mega Dimension</em> paid DLC, and this felt quite cynical &#8211; it feels strange to have paid DLC announced before we even have the base game. I&#8217;ll wait and see how that DLC materialises, but for now, I&#8217;m fine not seeing much more about <em>Z-A</em>, as I&#8217;m definitely purchasing the game at launch. From here, the Direct transitioned into the surprise announcement of <em>Danganronpa 2&#215;2</em>, a new version of <em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> with added content! I only relatively recently finished (<a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/09/danganronpa-2-goodbye-despair-review-an-ambitious-beautiful-mess-of-a-sequel/">and reviewed</a>) the original game on Switch, and I really enjoyed it overall, so I&#8217;ll be curious to see how much difference the additions make.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15020" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pokopia.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15024" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/z-a-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15025" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mega-dimension.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15022" height="338" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d2x2-1.jpg?w=600" width="600" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That was quite a long honourable mentions section, wasn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a result of just how many exciting announcements we received; I finished this Direct feeling very optimistic about the future of the Switch 2, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten into my top five reason why! When there are so many announcements, writing this sort of article helps me process the Direct and focus in on the games I&#8217;m going to prioritise playing, and I hope it is an enjoyable read for you too! Right, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#5: Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the most exciting part of the <em>Mario </em>section of the Direct was the announcement of a brand new Yoshi game, named <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em>! Yoshi side-scrollers have a reputation for charming art directions &#8211; for example <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Woolly World</em> and <em>Yoshi&#8217;s Crafted World</em> &#8211; and this game continues that, with a gorgeous stop-motion visual style bursting with colour and personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot of the game follows Yoshi after the appearance of a peculiar book named Mr. E, with pages detailing mysterious creatures. Yoshi jumps into the book (which is the reason for the storybook graphical style) and meets various new creatures, with the details jotted down into the book as Yoshi does so. Completing the storybook of fantastical creatures is an accompaniment to the charming platforming, and there&#8217;s a palpable sense of warmth and whimsy to it all. This game looks ideal for playing on a rainy weekend, wrapped up warm and enjoying the cosy gameplay. I see <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book </em>being a brilliant experience for all ages of players, and I look forward to playing it myself when it releases in Spring 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#4: Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Direct contained the announcements of release dates for several high-profile previously-announced games, and three of these appear on my list. Starting this off is <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>, the third <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> game after the original and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/05/15/my-to-play-list-may-2023-progress/">Age of Calamity</a></em>, which is confirmed to release on November 6th. Just as the latter of those filled in story gaps for <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, one of the main appeals of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is adding story details for <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. Specifically, the time period that Princess Zelda is sent back to in that game &#8211; and I&#8217;m glad to see this time covered more thoroughly, as it felt to me that Zelda was unfairly side-lined in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as a release date, the new footage showed off playable characters such as Queen Sonia, King Rauru, and a new unnamed Korok character. The gameplay looks like the expected <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-esque combat, but there are some additions, such as Zonai devices and multi-character Sync Strikes that change depending on the character combinations. There&#8217;s also the confirmation of local GameShare multiplayer and splitscreen, and glimpses of many epic visual sequences such as airborne Gleeok battles. I accept that the gameplay will likely be repetitive, but for me the appeal of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games is the visual spectacle and extra lore &#8211; and<em> Age of Imprisonment</em> looks to be delivering on that!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#3: Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the brand new announcements of the Direct was that of a new mainline <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, named <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em>. It&#8217;s been wonderful to see <em>Fire Emblem</em> gradually become a household name in the West, with the 3DS games such as <em>Awakening</em> laying the groundwork for <em>Three Houses</em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2022/09/14/a-little-zelda-a-lotta-farming-takeaways-from-the-nintendo-direct/">Engage</a> </em>to be massive hits on Switch. The distinction setting <em>Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart is the gladiator-style Heroic Games, which has a multitude of characters competing for the fulfilled wishes that supposedly reward your victory. At the end of the trailer, we see a tease of Sothis, a character from Three Houses &#8211; so it appears there may be a story connection to that game as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the game looks stunning, with gorgeous anime visuals, and clean turn-based strategy UI design. Part of the appeal of <em>Fire Emblem</em> is the stakes of building character relationships in a world where permadeath is possible, and the gladiatorial setting will hopefully provide a fresh twist to that structure that will set<em> Fortune&#8217;s Weave</em> apart. The trailer has a variety of striking characters, and I&#8217;m looking forward to finding my favourites! For now, we only have a general 2026 release date, so I&#8217;d guess that this game will be one of the major late-year releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#2: Resident Evil: Requiem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think it surprising that I&#8217;ve put two already-announced games above the news of a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game; but that&#8217;s a reflection of my adoration for the franchises these next two games are a part of, and how stoked I am to see additional news about their next instalments. Firstly we have <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, the much-anticipated ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> game (if you don&#8217;t count <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/27/resident-evil-zero-review/"><em>Resident Evil Zero</em></a>). This latest entry stars FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she pursues the truth about a deadly virus and the mystery of her mother&#8217;s death &#8211; a path which leads her to the ruins of Raccoon City. This game had already been announced for other consoles, but this is the formal announcement of a Switch 2 version, which is brilliant to see. On Switch, <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/11/25/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/16/resident-evil-village-review/">Resident Evil Village</a></em> could only be played as Cloud games, but the more conventional release of <em>Requiem </em>shows that the console can (for now, at least) keep up with modern large-scale third-party releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually might play <em>Requiem </em>on Switch 2 &#8211; my only other means would be PC or Xbox Series S, and as someone who likes to collect physical copies of <em>Resident Evil</em> games on console, that makes the Switch 2 version more appealing to me. <em>Requiem </em>is up there as one of my most anticipated games; I adore the <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise, and am eagerly awaiting <em>Requiem</em> to see how they interweave the lore of the series into the story. Other than Chris Redfield, we haven&#8217;t had any of the earlier characters show up in the main series since <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, and with the return to Raccoon City, this feels like an ideal time for some guest appearances of older, more experienced versions of those fan favourites. Grace Ashcroft is also the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character from the lesser-known spin-off <em>Resident Evil Outbreak</em> games, which already shows that Capcom is happy playing with some deep-cut lore. I happen to have bought the two <em>Outbreak</em> games second-hand before <em>Requiem</em> was even announced, and am planning to play them before the launch of <em>Requiem </em>and write up my thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Requiem </em>trailer in the Direct was full of intense visuals, threatening figures, and story hints (such as the iconic Umbrella Corporation logo). It struck me that there&#8217;s an underlying grungy tone waiting to break out, which I&#8217;m very excited to discover. This can even be seen in the logo for <em>Requiem</em>, and the burned-out profile shot of Grace near the end of this new trailer. Right now, the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise is in a very healthy place (as healthy a a series about viral monstrosities can be, anyway), and it&#8217;s given Capcom a resulting confidence that could make this game utterly exceptional. They&#8217;re playing their cards close to their chest, concealing the full extent of the horrors that await us on February 27th&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">#1: Hades II</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yes, oh yes. This is an announcement fans of <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/10/14/hades-review/">Hades</a></em> and Supergiant Games have been awaiting since the reveal of <em>Hades II</em> back at The Game Awards in 2022, and now it&#8217;s here &#8211; the release date of the official 1.0 version, releasing digitally on Switch and PC on September 25th (and physically on November 20th). The first <em>Hades</em> is a phenomenal roguelike action game that turned many players into fans of the genre, but it was quite a surprise when Supergiant announced a sequel &#8211; not only was the first game utterly jam-packed with content and ideas, but they&#8217;d never done a sequel game before. I&#8217;ve purposefully been avoiding details about the game in Early Access, as I&#8217;d like to go in fresh and see what marvels Supergiant have cooked up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon this could be a <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>/<em>Galaxy 2</em> situation, where the developers have so many ideas and so much creativity to share, that they need a whole other game to fit it all in. This time, we play as the immortal Princess of the Underworld, battling against the Titan of Time and exploring an even larger and deeper mythic world of Olympian Gods. In the Direct, this was visualized with a cutscene that gave me goosebumps from the visual flair on show; Supergiant are known for their sumptuous visuals and music, and that&#8217;s very much still the case here. I&#8217;m eager to dive back into the rich gameplay and gripping story of the world of <em>Hades</em>, reuniting with previous characters (Artemis is back!) and meeting new ones. I honestly didn&#8217;t expect the release date to be so soon, but in less than two weeks we&#8217;ll be able to play the 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> &#8211; discovering new Boons, enemies, locations, and more. Bring it on!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>This Nintendo Direct was sensational, and answered many questions about release dates and upcoming games for the Switch 2 (and Switch) release slate. I&#8217;ve been enjoying my gaming a lot recently, and this Direct has only fuelled that passion more &#8211; the only problem is going to be finding the time to play all these games!

It&#8217;s been roughly a year and a half since I wrote that post, and the Switch 2 has been out for just over three months &#8211; so we now have comprehensive knowledge of what the system offers. With the Switch 2, Nintendo took the wise (and safe) approach, capitalising on the continued popularity of the Switch brand and not changing things too drastically. The console is more of an iteration rather than a revolution, but it certainly makes significant changes and upgrades in certain areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had some time with the Switch 2, I thought it&#8217;d be a suitable moment to take a look back at my aforementioned post about my hopes for the console, run one-by-one through the list, and talk about which became a reality (and which didn&#8217;t). Then, at the end of the post, I&#8217;ll summarise my current personal opinions on the Switch 2, taking these results into account. Right then, let&#8217;s get into the list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Optimize the eShop: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My foremost request was to improve the eShop, which was struggling on multiple fronts on the original Switch: the sheer volume of releases made discoverability of games difficult; there was a lack of quality control; and the user interface was susceptible to noticeable lag. In my opinion, this was one of the most important areas for Nintendo to improve upon &#8211; it might seem less flashy than other aspects, but improving the process of finding new digital games is an underrated key aspect of a modern console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To start on a positive note, I&#8217;m pleased with the way Nintendo has improved the responsiveness of the eShop. I immediately noticed how much quicker and easier it is to navigate the store &#8211; gone are the painful moments waiting for the eShop to catch up with your inputs. Whether this is down to the increased hardware power, general eShop optimisation, or both, it improves the experience of browsing through the available games, and encourages curiosity as a result. In my book, that boost to game discoverability is a win for both the player and the developers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, whilst Nintendo has bolstered the options on the eShop main menu, it&#8217;s not as extensively as I&#8217;d hoped. Most of the options &#8211; such as the Search, Current Offers, and Coming Soon &#8211; are the same, and the only brand new addition is the For You tab, which recommends games based on your own gameplay trends. I was really hoping for some other additions, or even a review system so that players could help to recommend games for others. As it is, the eShop still has the problem of a constant inundation of new games &#8211; and whilst the Popular New Releases sub-section is a step in the right direction, any game that doesn&#8217;t qualify for this (or the Highlights tab) will get very limited time to grab player attention before the spotlight is taken by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14942" height="645" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14940" height="639" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14938" height="624" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14941" height="598" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of quality control, I reserve full judgement until more time has passed, but it seems that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t changed their approach. Lots of cheap-looking games are still flooding the eShop, and there are still Hentai games appearing relatively frequently. From my perspective, Nintendo could still do with raising the bar of entry, in order to curate a higher level of overall quality across the eShop. The current influx of these low-quality games worsens the issue of discoverability for other titles, which get mired amidst them despite taking much more time and effort to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the steps I&#8217;d still like to see taken for more eShop filtering options and better quality control, Nintendo has still significantly improved the eShop, especially in terms of responsiveness. Therefore, I mark this section as a success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More Power: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is that age-old request for new consoles &#8211; that they have more power, and are able to present games in higher framerates and resolutions. Since the Wii/DS era, Nintendo has rarely (if ever) been known as the technical powerhouse, with art direction, creative hardware, and recognizable IP being more important for bringing in players. That said, the Switch 2 is a big step up from the original Switch, with Nvidia claiming that it has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nvidia-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">&#8220;10 times the graphical performance&#8221;</a> of the previous console.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a technical expert, so I look for comparisons to other consoles to get a handle on where the Switch 2 lands power-wise. The general perception seems to be that at peak performance, docked on a TV, the Switch 2 is comparable to a PlayStation 4 Pro, but still behind the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles &#8211; which essentially matches my prediction back in March 2024. When played in handheld mode, the system is closer to a base PlayStation 4, but that is compensated for by the smaller screen, which often makes games look crisper to the eye (at least for me).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a hybrid system with a handheld option, battery life is another crucial factor to consider, and the increased performance does appear to have hurt the Switch 2 in this area. You generally get around two-three hours when playing any sort of intensive game, which can feel quite short. However, most of the time I don&#8217;t see this being an issue, unless I am on a very long journey &#8211; and it&#8217;s rare not to have a nearby place to plug in and charge. Whilst that isn&#8217;t an excuse, I prefer Nintendo providing stronger hardware and a shorter battery life rather than the opposite, so I&#8217;m still satisfied on this front. For example, I&#8217;m playing <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/09/17/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-14-09-23/">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em> at the moment, and occasionally having to charge the console is a small price to pay for how well it plays and looks in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14949" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14946" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14947" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14948" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When playing in handheld mode, the screen really is stunning; the increased size and power makes games look incredible, and it makes playing in bed (or wherever you prefer) feel like a luxury. The vibrancy and sharpness of the screen &#8211; especially when held close up for handheld gaming &#8211; gave me that new-generation-upgrade feeling that I was looking for. I&#8217;ve heard some disappointment that Nintendo didn&#8217;t use an OLED screen, but in my opinion the LCD screen is more than sufficient, and if it helps keep costs down then that&#8217;s a reasonable trade. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll get an OLED version of the Switch 2 (like for the original Switch) at some point too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only Switch 2-exclusive game I&#8217;ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em> (you can <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/10/mario-kart-world-review-a-stunning-racer-that-misses-a-few-tricks/">read my review here</a>), and as well as being a fantastic game, it doubles as an excellent technical showcase for the Switch 2. Played in 4K HDR on my TV, it looks sensational. The game moves with a crisp fluidity, and the environment feels palpably full of detail and colour. It was upon playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> that it really dawned on me that the Switch 2 was a major &#8211; and timely &#8211; graphical update on its predecessor, allowing it to keep fair pace with the technical state of gaming.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14934" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>All that graphical performance is needed to do justice to the beauty of Cow</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>All in all, whilst my test case for the Switch 2 is relatively limited for now (I haven&#8217;t played upgraded Switch games like <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/07/31/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-game-i-learned-to-love/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em> yet either), I&#8217;m confident that the Switch 2 has delivered on the level of power I personally need in a Nintendo console. I don&#8217;t need it to be top-of-the-range; as long as the system is powerful enough to realise the trademark visual flair of first-party Nintendo games, and is able to house a strong line-up of new third-party releases, then that&#8217;s plenty for me. I eagerly await seeing what Nintendo can magic up with their bespoke Switch 2 games in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Clarity on Games: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads nicely into my next point, on the topic of the Switch 2 software line-up now and into the future. A console is defined by the games on it &#8211; and there were two particular games I was waiting for news on when I wrote that original post in March 2024. These were <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> and also the next Nintendo EAD game, which I predicted would be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game in the vein of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. We have received news on both of these games, even if the latter wasn&#8217;t quite the game I expected, as it has instead materialised as <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14932" height="572" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I am loving the vibrant purples in this art, by the way</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about <em>Metroid</em>. The development path of the long-awaited <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> has been turbulent, to say the least &#8211; after being announced back in 2017, Nintendo then publicly announced that they were restarting development in 2019, with Retro Studios (the developers of the original <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em>) coming back on board. When I wrote my post about my hopes for the Switch 2, we were still awaiting news on Metroid &#8211; but roughly three months later <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/06/19/my-5-favourite-announcements-from-the-nintendo-direct-18-06-2024/">in the June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, Nintendo finally showed us an announcement trailer for the newly-titled <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That initial trailer gave us a taste of the returning first-person <em>Metroid</em> gameplay and a glimpse of returning enemy Sylux, which kept fans occupied until February 2025, when it was announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM&amp;t=1631s">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> that <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> would be a cross-generation title on both Switch and Switch 2. Whilst unsurprising, this was welcome news &#8211; and roughly a month later in March, we got another Nintendo Direct trailer (see below), showing off more of the game and giving us a 2025 release date. This was followed up by an extensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9xes7BZto">Nintendo Treehouse video</a> in April, continuing the steady stream of new information on the game. However, as we enter September, we&#8217;re awaiting news on a precise release date, and I hope we hear more soon. Even if the game has to be pushed into 2026, I wouldn&#8217;t mind &#8211; after so long waiting, I&#8217;d prefer to wait a little longer if it means a better experience. What&#8217;s another few months after eight years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be fascinating to see the comparison between the Switch 2 and Switch editions of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>; the enhanced Switch 2 edition will have Joy-Con 2 mouse controls as well as support for 4K, HDR, and 120 fps! After seeing how brilliant <em>Mario Kart World</em> looks, I&#8217;m excited to experience a new <em>Metroid</em> adventure in these formats &#8211; I have a feeling the game will look sensational. So far, it appears that the game isn&#8217;t straying too far from the gameplay of previous <em>Prime </em>games, and instead refining the first-person formula, with some added tricks such as Psychic Abilities for Samus. I&#8217;m especially intrigued to see where the story goes, and am avoiding too many plot details until release!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, I thought <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was the more outlandish of the two games I was anticipating back in March 2024, as I was confident that a new 3D <em>Mario </em>from Nintendo EAD would be announced. I was both right and wrong &#8211; whilst we haven&#8217;t received a 3D <em>Mario </em>per se, we have gotten a new <em>Mario</em>-adjacent Nintendo EAD 3D game, in the form of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! This was the closing reveal in the Switch 2 Direct back in April; but it wasn&#8217;t until the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Direct</a> in June that it was announced this isn&#8217;t just a Donkey Kong game, but a Pauline game as well, with a younger version of the character joining DK on his travels!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo EAD have an amazing track record, and the glowing critical reception to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>has been a continuation of this, praising the sheer gameplay creativity and enjoyment. One of the key features is the ability for Donkey Kong to smash through the environment, reshaping and even creating tunnels through it! The game released on 17th July, and I haven&#8217;t actually played it yet, as I haven&#8217;t found the time to justify spending the money on it. But now <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/">that I&#8217;ve finished the Pokémon League in <em>Pokémon Diamond</em></a> and am taking a break from that, I&#8217;ll hopefully soon get around to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, my next definite Switch 2 purchase will be <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, and I&#8217;m very tempted to get <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> too! There&#8217;s also the question about how series such as <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/10/25/where-can-zelda-go-after-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> and <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/09/16/10-hours-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing</a></em> might manifest on Switch 2, but I&#8217;m happy having patience &#8211; there are already so many other amazing games to play in the meantime!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">More System Customization: No</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, here we come to the first of my hopes that didn&#8217;t become a reality. The original Switch only allowed very simple customisation of the Home screen, and Switch 2 hasn&#8217;t evolved this at all, still only allowing two Themes: Basic White and Basic Black (my console is set to the latter). Having a Themes menu suggests the idea of having more options, but I&#8217;m not full of confidence, as we haven&#8217;t received any extra options since the original Switch launch in 2017.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14926" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>I like neutral colours, but the option to add more flair could be fun</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not a software developer, it feels like Nintendo is missing an open goal by not allowing us to have Themes based on franchises such as <em>Mario</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, or <em>Metroid</em> &#8211; I honestly think people would even spend a small amount on these, in order to add vibrant new visuals to their systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that Nintendo could still add options in the future, but it&#8217;s disappointing that for now there&#8217;s no word on this. In my March 2024 post, I suggested extra options such as the <em>Nintendo Badge Arcade</em> sticker system on 3DS, but now I feel as if I need to keep expectations in check. At this point, even a couple extra Themes would be great to see.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14928" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Themes menu even seems designed to hold more options</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As on the original Switch, the main way of showing personality is through your profile icon. Nintendo has added extra customisation options over time, particularly via the Nintendo Switch Online menu, where you can unlock new characters, backgrounds, and frames for your profile icon. Whilst it&#8217;s a mostly unchanged process from the Switch, I&#8217;m glad this bit of customisation is still present. I imagine it won&#8217;t be too long until we get more Joy-Con 2 colours, so at least there should soon be that avenue for customising the look of your console (if you have the expendable income). Considering how popular the Switch 2 is, it&#8217;d be wonderful to see more done on the digital side to allow players to show their personality. I hope we see developments in this area in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">Enhanced Social Features: Yes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth and final entry on this list regards the social aspects of the Switch &#8211; in my original post, this was primarily about having improved voice chat functions, and thankfully, this is the main social aspect where the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade! After years (and multiple console generations) of players asking, Nintendo has finally added an in-built party voice chat to the Switch 2, named GameChat. It&#8217;s now possible to talk to your registered friends over the internet, using the in-built microphone in the Switch (and Camera, if purchased), even if they are playing different software. Whilst it isn&#8217;t revolutionary &#8211; after all, other consoles have had similar systems for a long time &#8211; it&#8217;s a welcome addition that I&#8217;m very happy to see Nintendo include for the Switch 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous Nintendo consoles have had forms of voice chat, but they always had some sort of catch &#8211; for example on the Switch, where voice chat was tied to the Switch Online mobile app. So, it&#8217;s great to see Nintendo introduce a more complete and in-built offering &#8211; if anything, I feel a bit bad, because I doubt I&#8217;ll use it much. As the years have passed, I&#8217;ve gotten used to using Discord as an alternative form of online chat when playing Nintendo games, because it&#8217;s been more convenient &#8211; and I think it&#8217;ll be hard to break out of that routine. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m very glad GameChat has been added for the Switch 2, and I commend Nintendo for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I hoped to see some sort of extensive social hub added, along the lines of Miiverse or StreetPass. The closest is the Nintendo Switch App, which has new functionality such as uploading screenshots, receiving GameChat notifications, and (most intriguingly) interacting with games such as <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (see the images below). But I miss the in-built communal aspects of previous systems, as they brought people together without as much push towards a mobile app. We still have the News channels to get specific updates on the topics and games you choose to follow, but these are mostly one-way interactions. Nintendo has done well in previous generations at creating unique spaces for players to help shape the multiplayer culture of their consoles, but Switch and Switch 2 feel a bit more controlled in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14922" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14921" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14923" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png?w=576" width="576" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another aspect that the Switch 2 still lacks is an equivalent to Achievements or Trophies. This is something I used to think was a glaring omission, as it would be a great extra motivation to 100% games such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/04/30/lets-chat-a-long-overdue-super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>. But <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/11/16/why-ive-stopped-caring-so-much-about-achievements-trophies/">as years have gone by</a>, I have gained respect for Nintendo not having this sort of system, whether it be by conscious decision or simply a lack of intention to do so. There&#8217;s something freeing about playing games on the Switch, and indeed, the Switch 2 &#8211; there&#8217;s a lack of TV/streaming apps, or completion-style Achievement/Trophy systems, and instead the focus is all on the act of playing games. That laser-focus is really refreshing, and I&#8217;m not clamouring for those additions at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, whilst I&#8217;d like to see an expansion into a more communal gaming hub in the future, the Switch 2 definitely delivered on my hope for enhanced social features. The addition of GameChat is one of the major upgrades for the Switch 2, and a lot of marketing and development focus went into it, which shows Nintendo listened to player requests for this type of addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 22px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After going through those five points, how has the Switch 2 fared when it comes to my personal hopes for the console? Four of my five points were met to some degree of success, which I mark as a win overall. Evidently, Nintendo recognised the general areas where improvements could be made &#8211; and whilst not all of them were as emphatic an upgrade as I may have hoped, the cumulative progress makes for a significant leap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarise, I&#8217;m going to rattle back through the main points. Firstly, the eShop is much easier and faster to navigate, but could still do with more options for filters and user reviews. In addition, the console is a step up in power, and whilst it isn&#8217;t at the level of modern Microsoft and Sony consoles, games look brilliant and the hardware keeps Nintendo in the ballpark for third-party games. Speaking of which, we have received welcome news on <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, and seen the release of a new exciting Nintendo EAD game in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, and now we wait for the likes of <em>Pokémon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and other franchises to launch on the console. Sadly, Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added much in the way of system customization, but it has delivered new social options in the form of GameChat, finally bringing in-built party chat to a Nintendo console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the admitted caveats to some of the &#8220;Yes&#8221; points, I want to focus on the positives of the Switch 2. This is because, despite the iterative nature of the console, it does achieve that new-console feel. I was worried that it might feel like another specification of Switch instead of a brand new thing, but there are enough upgrades to ensure that isn&#8217;t the case. Much of this is down to the optimized power of the console, and how much snappier and responsive it is to play. But another contributing factor is the hardware itself &#8211; in handheld mode, the larger form factor and sleeker Joy-Con 2 designs feels fresh and streamlined, and the console has made playing in bed (for example) feel like a delightful high-end experience. I will say, it helps that I have massive hands, so the larger console size is more comfortable for me personally.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14952" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d like to see Nintendo continue to make software improvements to the Switch 2 &#8211; for example new eShop features, new menu Themes, and extra social hubs &#8211; but I&#8217;m left with a firmly positive impression of the console overall. I&#8217;ve been getting back into playing games more frequently recently, and I&#8217;m glad to say that the Switch 2 has been a contributing factor to that; and if I&#8217;m playing more games and having a good time doing so, that marks the Switch 2 as a success in my book!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this post! There are lots of Switch 2 reviews and reactions around the internet, so I hope this before-and-after approach was a personal, distinct, and enjoyable differentiation. For those of you who purchased a Switch 2, I hope you&#8217;re having a brilliant time with the console &#8211; please feel free to let me know your own thoughts in the comments below!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/09/09/did-my-hopes-for-the-switch-2-become-a-reality/feed/', 'slash_comments': '3', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/switch-2-featured-2.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/switch-2-featured-2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop5.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop3.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop4.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eshop2.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-4.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-2.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-3.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dave-the-diver-1.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cow.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mp4-switch-2-image.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom2.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/custom1.jpeg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app3.png?w=576', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app1.png?w=576', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/app2.png?w=576', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nintendo_switch_2_handheld_mode.webp', 'medium': 'image'}]}

As mentioned in that post, I was part-way through my first ever play through of <em>Diamond </em>at the time of writing. Of the two initial games (<em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>), <em>Pearl </em>was the one I got back in 2007, before then playing the third game <em>Platinum </em>when it released in 2009. I’ve kept my <em>Pearl </em>save to this day, whilst <em>Platinum </em>became the game I’d restart whenever I went back to play through Sinnoh &#8211; especially as it has extra content and various quality-of-life refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I hadn’t ever played <em>Diamond </em>until I felt compelled to buy myself a copy for £48.49 from GAME back in 2019. After all, <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>are second only to <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2020/07/11/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> in terms of my favourite games ever, so it’s lovely to have the complete set of three physical games. I’ve been gradually playing through <em>Diamond </em>ever since; in that aforementioned 2023 post, I noted that I’d reached the trek to Snowpoint City, roughly two-thirds of the way through the game. Since then, I&#8217;ve played a little bit more each year, finishing the villainous Team Galactic part of the main story, catching the cover Legendary Pokemon Dialga, and now preparing to tackle the Pokémon League!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-12 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14830" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14828" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14829" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14806" height="715" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve played through the Sinnoh-based <em>Pokémon</em> games, and the adventure feels a little different every time, for multiple reasons: , it might be the <em>Pokémon</em> team I choose, the approach I take, or how I’m feeling in my personal life at the time. With this being my first time playing <em>Diamond</em>, it&#8217;s felt unique once again &#8211; and as I gradually get ready to reach the end of the game (and start the postgame), I thought it’d be a nice point at which to write a journal-style post about the playthrough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, this journal approach matches my new writing method I’ve been testing, where I write a little bit every day, even if it’s just a paragraph or two. It’s helped me start posting at a more regular cadence recently, which I’ve really enjoyed, and am hoping to continue! I hope you’ll come with me on my retro-inspired ramble about my current adventuring in Sinnoh, and my plan to defeat the Pokémon League with a team that might be described as unconventional&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Shine Bright Like A&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For this playthrough of <em>Diamond</em>, I decided not to create my character as “William”. I often style my avatar as myself on my first playthrough of a <em>Pokémon</em> game; but as I&#8217;ve played through Sinnoh many times before, I instead went for the approach I use on repeated playthroughs. In these situations, I like to create a new character persona, in a way that challenges my team selection, mixes up the gameplay, and allows me to add my own imaginary lore. Over the years, this has often led to me constructing a monotype team (usually Steel, my favourite type), but this time I went for a dichotomy theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14797" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14795" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The character I created is called Lucie, and I think of her as treading the line between both fiery and subdued personalities. Her starter is Chimchar, which will evolve into Infernape, one of the infamously few Fire type Pokémon in the core region of Sinnoh in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em> (the Elite Four member Flint has just two Fire types in their Fire-type team)! Two of the team slots are filled by a pair of Gastrodons (named Gianna and Gillian), a Pokémon which has two forms in Sinnoh: the pink West Sea Gastrodon, and the blue East Sea Gastrodon. By having one of each, it plays into that duality theming; I think of the pink Gastrodon as part of the &#8220;bright&#8221;, flamboyant side of the team, whilst the blue Gastrodon represents the &#8220;nocturnal&#8221;, subtler side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining the West Sea Gastrodon side of the team, we have the blazing Infernape (named Symphony), as well as Raichu (Ryland) and their electrifying moves. These Pokémon both deliver fast, strong damage: for example, Close Combat and Flare Blitz for Infernape, and Thunderbolt for Raichu. On the East Sea Gastrodon side is Noctowl (Miles), which has helpful status moves such as the sleep-inducing Hypnosis, as well as Skuntank (Skylah), which has Toxic for poisoning opponents and whittling them down. As you can probably tell, I&#8217;ve always liked to daydream up my own head canon for the characters and adventure. It helps every playthrough to feel unique, as if I&#8217;m adding extra world-building along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-14 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14793" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14791" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14787" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14788" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14790" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14789" height="768" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the team described above certainly isn&#8217;t the strongest possible for <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>&#8211; and I&#8217;m aware I&#8217;m making my life more difficult when it comes to battling the toughest trainers, such as the upcoming Elite Four and Champion Cynthia. But some of these Pokémon (especially Gastrodon, Nowtowl, and Skuntank) are Pokémon I&#8217;ve barely played with before, so I get to experience the challenge of Sinnoh in a brand new way! Mixing up the team helps every playthrough to feel fresh, and strengthens my personal connection with the team &#8211; not just now, but also when I look back on them years later, such as in a longevity app like <em>Pokémon HOME</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">A Girl&#8217;s Best Friend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;ve just finished working through Victory Road, reached the entrance to the Pokémon League, and completed the final fight against your in-game rival (on a whim, I named them Mervin). Relative to other games in the series, I&#8217;d argue that Sinnoh has the best Pokémon League &#8211; the members all have distinct personalities, and present a well-balanced challenge. The difficulty isn&#8217;t unfair, but requires you to take the League seriously; I&#8217;m currently in the phase of backtracking, training up the levels of my Pokémon, and refining the movesets, items, and strategies I&#8217;m going to approach the League with. With the team I&#8217;ve selected, it requires being very deliberate with my choices &#8211; of course, the main advantage I have is that I&#8217;m particularly familiar with the challenge that lies ahead, and can plan accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-15 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14817" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14811" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14821" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14820" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14818" height="168" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216" width="216" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14799" height="192" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256" width="256" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sinnoh Pokémon League starts with the Bug-type trainer Aaron, who should be the easiest to defeat &#8211; Bug-types have many type weaknesses, such as to Fire and Flying, which my Infernape and Noctowl can target respectively. Next up will be Bertha and her Ground-type team, which will be a tougher test &#8211; the plethora of Ground attacks will be dangerous for Infernape and Raichu, so my two Gastrodons will be relied upon to use their Water-type moves. Noctowl has a useful immunity to Ground, and Skuntank can help out with Toxic, so my team has a decent amount of options for this battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is Flint, who as mentioned earlier, is a Fire-type trainer that curiously has three non-Fire types on their team. The two that are there &#8211; Rapidash and Infernape &#8211; should again struggle against the two Gastrodons, and then the rest of my team should be able to wear down Steelix, Drifblim, and Lopunny without too much issue. Then we&#8217;ll come to Lucian, the final member of the Elite Four, who has a Psychic-type team &#8211; and this is where Skuntank will have their turn taking centre stage, as their Dark typing makes them immune to Psychic moves. With the use of Night Slash (which has an elevated critical hit rate, boosted further by the equipped Razor Claw), Skuntank should carve through a lot of the opponents, with the help of Infernape to tackle the Steel typing of Bronzong.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-16 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14808" height="542" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721" width="721" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14810" height="548" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727" width="727" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing this plan out, it makes me fairly confident at defeating the Elite Four without too much trouble. However, players of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>know that the toughest challenge lies with Champion Cynthia and her excellent team of strong and varied Pokémon (which even includes a Gastrodon of her own)! The biggest threat is her ace Pokémon &#8211; Garchomp &#8211; which can likely take out most of my team with one hit from an Earthquake. My best options are going to be my two Gastrodons, which have strong defensive stats, and can use Blizzard and Ice Beam to hit the double Ice weakness of Garchomp. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll rely on Noctowl and Hypnosis, to give myself some more time. It&#8217;s going to be a nervy battle, but there are routes to success!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">In Reflection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage of the game, where I&#8217;m backtracking and gradually training up my Pokémon, showcases some of why I adore <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>so much. In theory, this part could be tiresome, gradually grinding through the experience points needed to make my team stronger &#8211; but instead, I find it tranquil. There&#8217;s something magical about the way music, visuals, and gameplay combine in these games specifically, and I enjoy taking my time; one of the main places I&#8217;m training is Victory Road, as I can access a variety of strong wild Pokémon there. Near the entrance is a useful Pokémon Center for healing your team, and I often pause to listen to the &#8220;Pokémon League&#8221; music that plays outside it. This particular track has both &#8220;Day&#8221; and &#8220;Night&#8221; versions, and the latter is especially beautiful (you can listen below). It&#8217;s a beautifully delicate composition, and captures the feeling of being near the end of an amazing adventure, but with so much still left to enjoy, and no need to rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to this music is just one example of the catharsis I feel when playing <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, which is something I talked about back in my 2023 post. This sentiment comes from a place of both subjectivity and objectivity, as my emotional connection to these games is incredibly strong. After my older sister passed away in 2007, I spent hundreds of hours exploring Sinnoh, and I&#8217;m forever grateful to the soothing effect they had &#8211; and still have &#8211; on me. There are many positive aspects I associate with this: the meticulous sprite artwork and colour palette; the endearing Pokémon and character designs; the region full of secrets to explore; the sprawling Underground; and that amazing soundtrack, just to name a handful of reasons why I love these games so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I prepare to enter the Pokémon League, I&#8217;ve also started thinking about the postgame, which in <em>Diamond </em>includes a whole separate island northeast of Sinnoh, named the Battle Zone (see the map below). It includes the Fight Area, Resort Area, and Survival Area, plus Stark Mountain. The Fight Area includes the Battle Tower in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>, which is less extensive than the expanded Battle Frontier in <em>Platinum</em>, but still offers plenty of challenge and longevity. I love the sheer amount of space left to discover in the postgame; this island is like an extra enclosed region to explore. Currently, I&#8217;m undecided on whether I&#8217;ll dive straight into this after the Pokémon League, or take a break and come back at a later time.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14813" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I&#8217;m well acquainted with the celebratory feel of the Battle Zone island, and may well get drawn into playing it immediately! After the high of defeating the Pokémon League, it&#8217;s wonderful to realise there&#8217;s still so much left for your Pokémon and you to explore. The Battle Zone has a vacation vibe, especially as you initially take a ship to get there &#8211; and the music is also uplifting and energetic, for example Route 225, which feels like a burst of energy, complete with the iconic clapping (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQvx9STW1V0">go to 00:42 in this video</a>)! Overall, the Battle Zone has a celebratory feel, and adds a lot to the overall package of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. I&#8217;m excited for the character of Lucie to extend her adventure, and take her dual-themed team onwards and upwards!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Space and Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope with this post is that it shone a light on two things: the reasons that set this playthrough of <em>Diamond </em>apart, and more detail on why I have such a strong connection to <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>. They are such special games to me personally, and for a long time, I&#8217;ve considered how to do that connection justice on this site. The 2023 post was a very cathartic one for me to write, and this post is an extension of that. It&#8217;s amazing how our personal circumstances can affect our thoughts on games (and other forms of media) &#8211; and I love hearing about these stories from other people too, as it often sparks positive discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14850" height="514" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827" width="827" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that down the line, I get to write another post about <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum</em>, talking about how the character of Lucie faced the Pokémon League, and then ventured into the postgame and Battle Zone. Down the line, I&#8217;ll likely inevitably play <em>Pokémon Platinum</em> again, and that&#8217;ll continue to be the game I go back to for replaying Sinnoh. For now though, I&#8217;m glad to have completed my physical set of <em>Diamond</em>/<em>Pearl</em>/<em>Platinum </em>games, and to be nearing the final stages of <em>Diamond</em>, with plenty of gameplay hours still ahead to look forward to!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for reading, I sincerely appreciate it. I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a brilliant day!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/25/lucies-quest-why-my-pokemon-diamond-playthrough-has-been-so-unique/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-featured-2.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-featured-2.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyrus.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-1.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spear-pillar-2.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-pearl-platinum-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trainer-card.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/team.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/noctowl.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skuntank.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-east.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-west.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raichu.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/infernape.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bike.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/diamond-2.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sunyshore.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snowpoint-image.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg?w=216', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aaron-room.jpg?w=256', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-2.jpg?w=721', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cynthia-1-1.jpg?w=727', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sinnoh_dp_artwork.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gastrodon-1.png?w=827', 'medium': 'image'}]}

This is the first brand new <em>Mario Kart</em> on consoles since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> on Wii U back in 2014 (the Switch received an upgraded version, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, in 2017, which I skipped) &#8211; so at least for me personally, it&#8217;s felt a long time coming. Mixed in with the excitement of a brand new Nintendo console, it made the launch of <em>Mario Kart World</em> feel like a real event, especially when played with friends, which is where <em>Mario Kart</em> always excels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of months, I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, in various different configurations: both on the TV and in handheld, in solo, local co-op, and online with a friend. Now, I&#8217;ve reached a point where I feel I can state a comprehensive opinion on the game, having experienced both the racing modes and the open world that&#8217;s a major selling point of this iteration of <em>Mario Kart</em>. My thoughts are overall very positive, but there are also some flawed aspects to the game  &#8211; but I&#8217;ll expand upon this more later on in the review. Without further ado then, let&#8217;s get into it!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Start Your Engines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it was the new-console glow, or perhaps it was that wait since <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, but launching into <em>Mario Kart World</em> for the first time felt distinctly special. The game encourages you straight into exploring the open world first; this consists of the various tracks connected by open spaces of road, field, water, desert, and more. What&#8217;s immediately remarkable about the game is just how gorgeous it looks, both in handheld but also especially when played on a 4K HDR TV &#8211; and whilst this isn&#8217;t new technology, it&#8217;s wonderful to play Nintendo games in such high fidelity via the Switch 2. The visual direction of <em>Mario Kart World</em> makes brilliant use of the new hardware, presenting a world full of vibrancy, colour, and personality &#8211; which is shown in the track designs, whether it&#8217;s the bustling Shy Guy Bazaar, the scrumptious Sky-High Sundae, or the fiery Bowser&#8217;s Castle, just to name three!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-17 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14727" height="574" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mkw_sgb_view.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14724" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_03.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14725" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_17.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The infused personality is evident in the roster of characters (complete with various different unlockable outfits). Returning are your usual suspects like Mario, Luigi, Peach, and so forth; additionally, there are plenty of newcomers, including minor enemies such as Konkdor and Cataquack, and even bit-part characters such as Dolphin and, of course, Cow! If you&#8217;ve seen any discourse about <em>Mario Kart World</em> since the initial announcement, you&#8217;ll know that the Cow and their adorable grin has captured the attention of the internet, and I&#8217;ve had a wonderful time watching the various memes and edits their inclusion has spawned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the characters have a range of changeable outfits too, which are unlocked by collecting Dash Food bags from vendors in races or the open world. It adds an extra way to differentiate the characters, ranging from punk rock biker looks to desert outfits and much more in between &#8211; and they can be combined with the plentiful different karts and bikes to create the aesthetic you&#8217;re looking for. A Photo Mode has been added in tandem with this, giving plentiful options for taking pictures that show off the world and characters as you see fit. Me being me, I&#8217;m sad that we got an Explorer outfit Toad but no actual Captain Toad&#8230; But there&#8217;s always time for that in DLC, hopefully!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14754" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldyoshi.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A smorgasbord of Yoshi! Or Yoshis? Yoshies?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The attention to detail in both audio and graphic effects is especially apparent when you build up speed. Karts and bikes camber side-to-side when they hop and drift; tyres are spongey and visibly bounce and recoil according to the track surface; and sparks crackle off your vehicle as you drift and build up a boost, just to name a small handful of the details I&#8217;m talking about. I particularly like the tension of drifting around the sharpest corners, with the screen often tilting with you and making it extra satisfying to hit the apex. Plus, the music is noticeably exceptional, supplying a consistently energetic chorus that accentuates the gameplay &#8211; especially in the final unlockable tracks, which supply a climactic crescendo unlike any other I&#8217;ve experienced in <em>Mario Kart</em>. Overall, the whole experience is lifted by this pristine look and feel, whether it&#8217;s the relatively laid-back open world, or the competitive modes, where the palpable sense of momentum is most gripping. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a Knockout!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the &#8220;World&#8221; being a key selling point of the game, it&#8217;s still those core competitive modes that retained the tightest grip on my attention. Whilst the expected familiar selection of Grand Prix, custom VS, Battle, and Time Trial modes are all here, the game deserves credit for also introducing a brand new main mode to go alongside Grand Prix. This goes by the name of Knockout Tour, where 6 different tracks are combined together into one extra-long race. It takes advantage of the increased count of 24 racers to introduce checkpoint gates along the way, eliminating those at the back each time. Essentially, it&#8217;s a way of introducing popular battle royale-esque sensibilities into <em>Mario Kart</em>, and it creates a very fun sense of chaos &#8211; especially in local multiplayer, when your friends and you are desperately trying to stay in the race amidst the various items flying around!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14736" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_36.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A road trip across the Mushroom Kingdom! Thankfully, less traffic jams than real life</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Knockout Tours are arguably the biggest challenge awaiting completionist solo players in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It&#8217;s classic knowledge now that to get the maximum 3-star rating in Grand Prix, you need to win all four races; but in Knockout Tour, you need to be leading through every single checkpoint! This is an extremely tough task, as it necessitates not just victory, but to be consistently leading &#8211; even despite homing Red Shells, or the dreaded blue Spiny Shells that target the leader. I set myself the personal challenge of 3-starring every Knockout Tour, and it led to many failed attempts, but it was highly satisfying when I finally achieved that goal. For <em>Mario Kart</em> veterans, it&#8217;s a good addition to have a target that takes this extra level of dedication to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just mentioned the items and the chaos synonymous with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and that side of the game is just as entertaining (and frustrating) as ever before! To me, <em>Mario Kart</em> is similar to other games such as <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> because at their core, each iteration is built on the same gameplay loop, and it makes it tough to critique a new entry &#8211; on one hand, it&#8217;d be unwise to stray too far from what makes the series so immensely popular, but on the other, there has to be enough new ideas to justify a new game that still feels imaginative.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-18 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14737" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_32.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14738" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_33.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14740" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_35.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As aforementioned, the Knockout Tours are a standout way in which <em>Mario Kart World</em> achieves the latter, and some of these ideas bleed over into Grand Prix, where you don&#8217;t just drive around four tracks &#8211; instead, after the first race, the initial laps are rolling starts, as you drive across the world to the next track, road-trip style. It&#8217;s a neat way to keep the same formula but match it to the open-world aesthetic of <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; and in VS there are options to play either in this mode, or with the traditional laps, catering to either preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further to this, there are tweaks to the racing itself, the most notable arguably being the new parkour/trick abilities. If you drive up onto a rail, you can grind along it and perform extra trick boosts, and you can even trick onto a wall and wall-ride along it, which opens up jaw-dropping shortcuts if you master this ability (there are plenty of astonishing clips doing the rounds online)! On top of this, drifting boosts can now be used in a straight line, and launch you off the ground slightly to help initiate some of these parkour moves. In combination, all these extra options elevate the height of the skill ceiling, and keep <em>Mario Kart World</em> engaging for those who have mastered previous entries in the series. Crucially, it does this without losing the accessibility as a go-to local multiplayer party game &#8211; the extra skills are a cherry on top for those who want to go above and beyond, but they&#8217;re not essential for winning races against the CPU.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14755" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_19.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Boo Cinema is another standout track, which applies a film filter to part of the course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Items are one of the infamous levellers of <em>Mario Kart</em>, and there have been some tweaks and additions on this front too. Your usual roster of shells, bananas, and mushrooms, and more are all here, although it&#8217;s noticeable that the raw power of items such as Bullet Bill have been slightly softened, perhaps to accommodate the new racer count of 24. Some of the notable new items include the golden Coin Shell, which leaves a trail of coins behind it, and the feather, which leaps you into the air, opening another opportunity to perform tricks, wallrides, and other shortcuts. To more literally aid more inexperienced players, there are still the helpful options for motion controls, auto-accelerate, and driving aids. Whilst these aren&#8217;t new, they&#8217;re still great to see return, and are often essential for balanced 4-player sessions that everyone can enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Give Me a Boost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As fun as <em>Mario Kart</em> can be in solo play, multiplayer is where the series has always shined brightest, and that continues to be the case for <em>World</em>. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to play with several combinations of friends, and the game has impressively accommodated their varying levels of <em>Mario Kart</em> experience each time, whether they&#8217;re a fresh newcomer or someone who&#8217;s been away from the series for a while. It&#8217;s easy to criticize the items when they&#8217;re hitting you, but they do a great job at helping those towards the back stay with the pack, and there&#8217;s still the option to use items such as shells and bananas defensively whilst in the lead.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14743" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_30.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Expect to shout at your friends &#8211; in a pleasant way, of course</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Local multiplayer has consistently resulted in a brilliant time, complete with the playful shouting, cheers, and competitive back-and-forth that you hope for from <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; so I can report that it&#8217;s a success in that department! My favourite local multiplayer option is the extended custom VS modes, which have plenty of customisable options, including speed, difficulty, item frequency, and the amount of races, which go up to 32 at a time. As a big Formula 1 fan, I love to nerd out about the accumulated points and the drama of how the final standings will end up, so VS will inevitably become my most-played mode!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of online play, <em>Mario Kart World</em> doesn&#8217;t quite hit the same heights as local multiplayer, because of that lack of immediate in-person reaction &#8211; and whilst it&#8217;s admirable that Nintendo has added chat functionality, I did end up defaulting to using a Discord call instead, because of the familiarity and ease of use. The main motivation to play online is to raise your versus rating (VR), which is essentially the same system we had way back on <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>. In my opinion, it&#8217;s disappointing that Nintendo hasn&#8217;t added more reasons to play online, especially in a gaming landscape where online games consistently add new modes, tournaments, and other rewards for playing consistently. The end result is that I quickly fell off of online multiplayer, and have focused mostly on solo and local multiplayer.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14753" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mariokartworld_27.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Driving on water supplies opportunity to perform tricks as you bounce over the waves</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, I found that the returning Battle Mode was most ideal for multiplayer &#8211; in <em>World</em>, there are two options, Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, which will be familiar to players of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. Balloon Battle gives you five balloons to protect whilst doing your best to hit opponents and earn points for removing their balloons, and Coin Runners has you searching for as many coins as you can, whilst again attempting to hit others and remove their coins (whilst avoiding them doing the same to you). I have to say, I&#8217;ve never been a huge Battle Mode fan over the years, and this version hasn&#8217;t changed that &#8211; but conversely, if you love Battle Mode, this will fill that quota well. My main disappointment is that the modes are time-based instead of score-based, as I generally prefer having that concrete target and the tension of seeing who can reach it first. Despite my criticisms, I am glad Battle Mode is back, as it offers a welcome change of pace from the racing modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Free as a Birdo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, a major differentiator for <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the inclusion of a free roam mode, where you can explore the tracks (and the spaces between them) at your leisure. There&#8217;s certainly an immediate novelty to this &#8211; I have nostalgic memories of <em>LEGO Racers 2</em>, which I played a lot on PC as a child, and included a similar experience of exploring an open world between races in a colourful, family-friendly world. My hope was that <em>Mario Kart World</em> might recapture that whimsical feeling, and supply a world with plenty of secrets and rewards, and most importantly motivation to find them. At first, <em>World </em>is successful in this; one of my earliest ventures was rocking up to the Dino Dino Jungle area, and visiting the inner laboratory/auditorium section. With precise driving and the careful use of tricks, you can make your way to the top of this area &#8211; which is thrilling the first time, but soon the realisation kicks in that there&#8217;s a lack of reason to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-19 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14746" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroampeachcoin.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14747" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamquestionmarkpanel.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14745" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroambluecoins.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in free roam,<em> Mario Kart World </em>has an uncanny sense of emptiness, and it&#8217;s partly because that palpable sense of forward energy &#8211; which is so prevalent in the competitive modes &#8211; is gone, without being replaced by much else. It&#8217;s not that there isn&#8217;t anything to do in the open world &#8211; for example, there are Peach Medallions and Question Mark Panels to find, as well as P Switches that activate various challenges &#8211; but the problem is that there isn&#8217;t much motivation to track all these things down. The main rewards are stickers, which are small graphic icons you can attach next to your profile name, and feel inconsequential. More work needed to be done to make the world feel alive, and not just like a suspended state of limbo from the Grand Prix mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toads and Shy Guys milling around and making campfires are a great touch, but they&#8217;re another short-lived novelty that doesn&#8217;t add substance to the experience of navigating the open world. It&#8217;s fun to find items and complete challenges, but they&#8217;re incredibly scattered &#8211; and whilst there&#8217;s a tracker for the Question Mark Panels, there&#8217;s curiously no in-game indicator for how many Medallions or Switches are left to find (and also no statistics or records screen for other modes, either). On the other hand, something free roam does do well is increasing the level of awe the world has. You can travel a long way out into the ocean, and discover sea dragons, whales, and more, and I had a great time inspecting the scale of impressive courses such as DK Spaceport. As mentioned at the start of the review, <em>Mario Kart World</em> is a stunning game to look at and listen to, and the open world gives you more time to do just that.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14748" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1600px-mkworldfreeroamring.png?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>P Switch challenges often consist of time trials</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s a great shame that there&#8217;s no formal splitscreen multiplayer for the open world &#8211; there&#8217;s a partial workaround, by loading into an empty wireless mode lobby, but challenges are turned off, and it&#8217;s not at all optimal. In a game marketed on free roam, and in a series known for local multiplayer, it&#8217;s a disappointing oversight that significantly reduces the reason to play this way. I have occasionally played free roam in single-player as a laid-back secondary experience, for example when listening to a podcast or talking to friends &#8211; but it has untapped potential as a playground for friends to enjoy together, and honestly, I think this would&#8217;ve papered over many of my problems with the emptiness of the open world. Instead, more often than not, you&#8217;ll launch straight into Grand Prix, Knockout Tour, or VS, as that is where the most joyous parts of <em>Mario Kart World</em> reside.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to the end of this review, I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;ve flagged multiple issues I have with <em>Mario Kart World</em> &#8211; so I need to re-emphasize that this is a genuinely excellent <em>Mario Kart</em> game, that not only delivers the best-looking and best-sounding entry into the series, but has multiple new ideas and modes that make it feel distinct. Changeable character outfits, new trick mechanics, and especially the Knockout Tour mode supply fresh style that have made <em>World </em>my new go-to local multiplayer game, and a game I&#8217;ve spent many an enjoyable hour in by myself as well. The main disappointment has to be the free roam mode, which feels sparse and quickly struggles to retain player attention &#8211; and I really hope that in the future, Nintendo supports the game with additional content that fills out this world more. Alternatively, add Captain Toad to the playable characters, and I&#8217;ll probably be happy, haha! In all seriousness, <em>Mario Kart World</em> definitely has flaws, but the core racing experience is dazzling, and it&#8217;s a superb way to start the Switch 2 era!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

I&#8217;ve written about this in multiple posts on this site, and I&#8217;ve noticed how I&#8217;m gradually getting deeper into the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> ecosystem: starting with looking back to the anime, and then playing the online game <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and now getting more invested in learning about the current meta and competitive side of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> is a complicated game with lots to learn (and relearn) for someone like me, who hasn&#8217;t been up-to-date on the meta since I stopped playing local tournaments about a decade-and-a-half-ago. But I&#8217;m slowly learning, and I&#8217;m enjoying how it&#8217;s happening naturally, via watching various YouTube creators, playing different decks in <em>Master Duel</em>, and even constructing a real-life deck that I could conceivably return to local tournaments with. So, in this post, I&#8217;m going to talk a little more about these various aspects of the game, the deck I&#8217;m playing, and why I&#8217;m enjoying this process so much!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Getting the Fire (Kings) Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve already written about <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/12/31/why-im-giving-yu-gi-oh-master-duel-another-shot/">how I&#8217;ve gotten back into <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em></a>, but only now have I reached the point where I&#8217;m starting to understand the competitive meta. At first, I was playing relatively low-powered (by current standards) decks such as Dark Magician and Monarchs, because those cards were familiar to me. But realistically, those decks aren&#8217;t fast-paced enough to keep up nowadays, so I started testing other avenues. I&#8217;ve played a fair amount of Gravekeepers, which can sometimes work in the competitive scene, if you draw the right cards (such as Necrovalley) in order to shut off abilities from the opponent. But this wasn&#8217;t a strategy that was going to help me learn the competitive game long-term, and I found that I eventually reached a point of repetition and subsequent burnout playing the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-20 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14664" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14665" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14666" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gravekeepers brought me a decent level of success!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This brought me to the HERO cards, especially Destiny HEROs, as I have a nostalgic affinity for them. The modern HERO cards have many combo effects that special summon various powerful cards, so they were much more helpful for learning the increased modern speed of combos in a deck. But I still found the HERO cards to lack flexibility for different situations, and I again reached a point where I hit a brick wall with the deck. It felt like I had hit also hit a wall in my efforts to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> in a contemporary fashion, as I couldn&#8217;t find a deck I clicked with. So I took a bit of a break from <em>Master Duel</em>, and started looking into which decks would be viable to assemble if I was playing the physical TCG (Trading Card Game). After looking at various Structure Decks as starting points, I finally found one which made sense to test out: Fire Kings!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire Kings are a deck based around monsters that destroy themselves either on the field, in the hand, or from the deck, to then activate various effects, including summoning monsters and destroying cards on the field. In addition, they have an impressive boss monster in &#8220;Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings&#8221;, which can destroy every other monster on the field (and has a magnificent summoning animation in <em>Master Duel</em>, see below)! The fiery aesthetic of these cards is well-realised in the stunning artwork, which mixes regal distinction with blazing power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-21 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14678" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14674" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14676" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14677" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14675" height="576" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Master Duel summon animations are, in a word, awesome</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the cards are relatively accessible in the real world, with only &#8220;Fire King Courtier Ulcanix&#8221; demanding a higher price point (of about £15 a copy). Most of the main Fire King cards can be acquired in the modestly priced Fire King Structure Deck &#8211; I bought three copies of this, as well as some other products (such as the recent Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Deck, which includes reprints of staple cards such as Infinite Impermanence), to construct a real-life Fire King deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, I find it helpful to have a real deck in front of me, which I can draw test hands with to slowly understand the playstyle better (I&#8217;m hoping for a reprint of Ulcanix, so I don&#8217;t have to drop £45-ish on a playset)! The result of this process is finally finding an archetype I like, which is viable to build in both <em>Master Duel</em> and the TCG &#8211; and to top it all off, Fire Kings are competitively strong too! Whilst they aren&#8217;t currently considered a top tier deck like Maliss or Ryzeal, Fire Kings do perform well in current competitive play, even winning the YCS Birmingham event this year, piloted by Dinh-Kha Bui! This tells me that if I can improve my own skill and understanding of the deck, then Fire King can reach a high ceiling of play in both <em>Master Duel</em> and local tournaments (should I decide to go&#8230; More on that later)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14669" height="696" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>It needs some changes still, but my TCG Fire King deck is taking shape!</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m playing lots of Fire King in Ranked games on <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</em>, and with every game, every new scenario, and every mistake I make (I&#8217;m admittedly still making a lot of those), I&#8217;m learning the intricacies of the deck, how to perform the best combos, and how to make the strongest boards in combination with my Extra Deck of Link, XYZ, and Synchro Monsters. I like how Fire Kings have such a strong Fire connection, which enables them to make use of several non-Fire cards as additions to the deck. For example, a common choice for Fire Kings is &#8220;Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames&#8221;, which can revive back one of your Fire Kings alongside it when summoned. This synergy is very satisfying, and ties into the overall theme of the deck, resulting in an archetype that feels richly-designed and well-realised. I&#8217;m enjoying learning the Fire King strategies, and I hope that by my next <em>Master Duel</em> post on this site, I can report that I&#8217;ve become steadily better at piloting the deck!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Creators I Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside my own proactive efforts to become better at contemporary <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I&#8217;ve been watching several YouTube creators that are a brilliant source of both entertainment and knowledge for me. <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/">In previous posts, I&#8217;ve mentioned</a> how TGS Anime and Team APS helped me get reacquainted with classic <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, which lines up with my aforementioned play of anime decks such as Dark Magician. I still watch these channels, but I&#8217;ve added several others to my regular watchlist, including the &#8220;wonky quartet&#8221; of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGuDrveqBgD0S9nqaOPw6Q">Farfa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MBTYuGiOh">MBT</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Nyhmnim">Nyhmnim</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dzeeff">Dzeeff</a>, who consistently create great content focused primarily around <em>Master Duel</em>. Often, they add fun variables to challenge themselves, such as in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xajsij7iS98">Master Chef</a> series by MBT, or the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbldWY88--A">Storage Wars</a> series by Farfa.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Videos like this (by Joshua Schmidt) are brilliant at showcasing both the fun and skill of </em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly thanks to these channels and their collaborations, I&#8217;ve also become aware of other popular YouTubers &#8211; specifically, ones focused around high-level competitive play. These are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaSchmidtYGO">Joshua Schmidt</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jessekottonygo">Jesse Kotton</a>, who are well-known for often winning or placing highly in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> tournaments. Both of them balance speaking confidently about modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> with also making videos that are fun to watch, which is very impressive and makes them stand out. Both their channels have been helpful to me, and I also like it when they have those earlier-mentioned collaborations with channels like Farfa and MBT, as they bring a little bit of extra seriousness to those videos. Discovering this range of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> players and creators has been an unexpected extra positive side effect of getting back into the game and franchise!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">It&#8217;s Time to Duel?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;ve talked about how I&#8217;ve not just been looking at the digital version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> (with <em>Master Duel</em>), but also my physical collection of cards as well. I have a fairly large amount of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> cards, mostly from my childhood and teenage years, and further supplemented with occasional more recent purchases when something has stood out to me. Those Fire King and Blue Eyes White Destiny Structure Decks have given me access to plenty of modern cards to assemble a deck with, and I also picked up products like the Duel Devastator set from 2019, which was full of guaranteed competitive staples like &#8220;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&#8221;. This is all to say that I&#8217;m nearing a place where not only am I improving at <em>Master Duel</em>, but I could conceivably go to an in-person event near me and test out my skills in person (scary, I know, haha)!</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14673" height="672" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Recent structure decks have been ideal for helping me build Fire Kings</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Jokes aside, there&#8217;s only a few things stopping me from doing this, and one of them is overcoming that social anxiety. I&#8217;ve become better at this over the years, but I definitely find the initial ice-breaking of heading to a new club/group quite daunting. About a year ago, I also experienced this when joining a nearby running club &#8211; there is that initial awkward stage of getting to know people and faces, but it gets easier over time. I&#8217;m confident that this wouldn&#8217;t be a long-term issue, especially as I now know a friend who has introduced me to a local store that hosts Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next barrier is more closely related to the theme of this post &#8211; and that&#8217;s a personal target to be relatively well-acquainted with the game before showing up to a local tournament again. I&#8217;m definitely nearing this stage, and part of this preparation would be making the finishing touches to my Fire King deck. I&#8217;d like to get that playset of three Fire King Courtier Ulcanix first, as they&#8217;re integral to the strength of the deck. The card is out of stock on most sites, and my best route currently seems to be waiting for a good UK price on Cardmarket. I could wait and hope for a cheaper reprint, but there is no sign of this happening at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jesse Kotton has a video about Fire Kings and their affordability</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I&#8217;d like to get a copy of some extra staple Extra Deck cards such as &#8220;S:P Little Knight&#8221;, and possibly acquire some extra non-Fire King cards that often seen play in the deck, such as &#8220;Bystial Magnamhut&#8221; and &#8220;Bystial Druisworm&#8221;. The main thing I&#8217;m keeping an eye on is price &#8211; for example, in an ideal world I&#8217;d also add competitively strong cards such as &#8220;Mulcharmy Fuwalos&#8221; to the deck, but that would cost another £70-ish for a playset, and I haven&#8217;t even gone to a local event yet (I do have a tendency for overthinking)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve still not decided if I&#8217;ll make the time to make the leap to playing the TCG in-person again, but I&#8217;m getting increasingly tempted to have a go. It would enable me to test out my skills, and it could also be a way to make new friends and connections. When I went to local events in my teenage years, I enjoyed the trading side of the game too &#8211; and who knows, perhaps that&#8217;s a better way to acquire some of these missing cards for my Fire King deck. If I do decide to go, I hope to write up about my experience on this site, however well (or badly, haha) it goes!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">In Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the third <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> centric post I&#8217;ve written over the last 8 months, and they&#8217;re good reflections of how I&#8217;ve gotten back into the franchise as a whole: not just my nostalgic connection, but how I&#8217;ve been learning about the modern game and how it&#8217;s evolved over time. I admittedly used to be someone who lamented that <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> had become too complicated and suffered from power creep &#8211; and whilst those aren&#8217;t completely untrue, I think they were oversimplifications on my part. Having now taken the time to ingrain myself back into the world of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, I see that the game has developed into something new &#8211; something faster, more complex, and in some ways arguably better than before.</p>\n\n\n\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top: 75%;">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this post has explained how I&#8217;m pushing myself to get better at the game, with the conduit of a Fire King deck as my resource for playing the game at a higher skill level than before. I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn still, both about this deck and other decks, but I&#8217;m having an excellent time doing so &#8211; which is probably evidenced by me considering playing the TCG in-person again at some point in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this post, and I sincerely hope you are happy, healthy, and having a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/08/03/how-fire-kings-are-helping-me-learn-competitive-play-in-yu-gi-oh-master-duel/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-featured-3.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deck-boxes.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/destiny.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gravekeepers.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-board.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/promethean-princess.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-chain.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-master-duel-deck.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/garunix-eternity.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-irl-1.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fire-king-deck-and-junk-warrior-mat.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Somehow we&#8217;re already into the second half of the year &#8211; so much has happened and I&#8217;ve gone through a lot of personal growth because of it (including an eventful end to the marathon&#8230; )!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks as ever to all those reading my posts every month, even with my slower posting schedule &#8211; I never stop appreciating it! Right then, let&#8217;s get into the post, and I hope you enjoy the read!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Edinburgh Marathon 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/">my build-up and training for the Edinburgh Marathon</a> multiple times since I started planning in November 2024, and after a train journey up to Edinburgh and a couple of days in the city, on May 25th 2025 the day finally arrived for my first marathon! My parents and some close friends were there to support me, and I also had the support of all those who contributed to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">my charity fundraiser for Beat</a> (the Eating Disorder charity). Thank you to everyone who donated or even just took a look at my Justgiving page &#8211; I&#8217;m really proud to spread awareness for a charity that means a lot to both my family and I.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14636" height="607" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fundraise-1.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So, you may be asking, how did the marathon go? It was a tough one, and Scotland threw all the elements at us. There were periods of sun, rain, strong winds, and even hail when I reached approximately mile 20! As expected, the last 10-ish miles are where the battle really begins, as much mental as physical. It was important to me that I do my absolute best and never stop or walk if I can help it, and at mile 25 I got to see my friends and family cheer me on as I neared the finish line!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was an unexpectedly dramatic finish. With the finish line in sight, and as I pushed for the line with maybe 100 metres left to go, I was struck with the notorious &#8220;jelly legs&#8221; and fell. I managed to get back to my feet with the help of another nearby runner, and made it to the line. As someone who is very critical of themselves, I was disappointed at not finishing the run in better style &#8211; and this is where my family and friends were invaluable at stopping me from being too harsh on myself. It was a great reminder of how much they care for me and how much support I had on the day, and I am incredibly grateful to them and everyone else who has congratulated me since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-22 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14624" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Early on&#8230; !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14622" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the race</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14623" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1.jpeg?w=683" width="683" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The final stretch!</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Including Gift Aid, we raised £1,821.77 for Beat, and I&#8217;m very proud of this, as well as the personal achievement of finishing the marathon. I&#8217;m still deciding whether or not to do another marathon &#8211; after not finishing in quite the way I hoped, I am feeling motivated to do another one, maybe the Norfolk Marathon in 2026!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest gaming news stories over the last few months has been the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. As not only a gaming fan but also specifically a Nintendo fan, I got my console immediately, and have been playing it a significant amount since! Whilst it&#8217;s more of an iteration than a revolution in terms of hardware, I personally enjoy the larger console and screen size, as it fits my larger hands very well. The only exclusive game I have so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I&#8217;ve put many an hour into!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14620" height="534" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/switch-2.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, <em>Mario Kart World</em> feels like the first new entry since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> many years ago, as I played a lot of the latter on Wii U and never felt the need to buy the <em>Deluxe</em> version on Switch. Therefore, <em>World</em> feels very fresh to me, and it&#8217;s also visually spectacular (especially on a big 4K HDR TV). I&#8217;ve 3-starred all the Grand Prix and am now working away at the Knockout Tours, which are battle-royale style checkpoint races new to this game. These Knockout Tours are very tough to get 3-stars on, but I&#8217;m enjoying the challenge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a few criticisms of the game &#8211; including my own biased disappointment at no inclusion of Captain Toad, haha &#8211; but also about the open-world twist on the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula. In concept, it&#8217;s a smart way to go, but I have mixed feelings on the execution, as the world feels a little empty and repetitive to explore. Despite this, I&#8217;m going to save my full thoughts, as I plan to write a dedicated review at some point soon. One thing is for sure, and that&#8217;s <em>Mario Kart World</em> being the new go-to local multiplayer game for my friends and I!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the Switch 2 itself, it does feel like an investment for the future, as outside of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and now <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> (which I hope to play soon), there&#8217;s a lack of headline exclusive titles. But for now, the hardware upgrade and promise for the future &#8211; plus the fun of <em>Mario Kart</em> &#8211; has made it feel worth the purchase for this Nintendo fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class="has-text-align-left">My watching habits have been quite eclectic recently! In terms of the films, the standout has to be <em>Superman</em> &#8211; as a huge DC fan, I had high hopes for this fresh, brighter take on the iconic character, and James Gunn and company thoroughly delivered. The film is a shining beacon of positivity, fun, and creativity, and David Corenswet is a brilliant Superman to centre the new DCU around. I&#8217;m very excited to see where things go in the future, but for now I&#8217;m just so happy that we got a satisfyingly hopeful take on Superman again. I&#8217;m hoping that these vibes continue in <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> on the Marvel side, which I&#8217;m going to see tomorrow as of writing this!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-23 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14617" height="1023" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/superman-poster.jpg?w=819" width="819" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14618" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f4-poster.jpg?w=691" width="691" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of TV, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to <em>The Walking Dead</em> (I really liked the recent film <em>28 Years Later</em>, and I think it&#8217;s helped put me in the zombie mood). I originally stopped watch <em>The Walking Dead</em> in Season 8, which is where a lot of people dropped off, in the war between Rick and Negan. However, I heard that it picks up afterwards, so I decided to go back, charge through Season 8, and see what I find in those last few seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst Season 8 remains a poorly-paced season, I&#8217;m glad I went back, especially because Season 9 is brilliant TV. Clearly lessons were learned from the negative reception to previous seasons, and Season 9 focuses back on character development, inventive new threats, and grounded emotional stakes. It hooked me in and I&#8217;m enjoying the ride of these last few seasons!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m already looking ahead to watching the newer <em>The Walking Dead</em> spin-offs such as <em>The Ones Who Live</em> and <em>Daryl Dixon</em>, to see where these characters end up. Other than <em>The Walking Dead</em>, I&#8217;m also slowly making my way through the latest Marvel show <em>Ironheart</em>, which hasn&#8217;t been marketed very well by Disney &#8211; which is a shame, as it&#8217;s very well-made and full of great performances.  To loop back around to <em>Superman</em> and the DCU, I&#8217;m also eagerly anticipating <em>Peacemaker</em> Season 2, which will tie into that film and the larger world!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this summation of some of what I&#8217;ve been up to recently! One of my goals for the rest of the year is to start writing here more consistently &#8211; I&#8217;ve been saying this for a while, but it&#8217;s something I really want to get back to. It&#8217;s been necessary for me to spend more time on my personal life and take breaks from writing, but in the process of that personal growth, it&#8217;s reminded me how much I like writing about the things I play, watch, and do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I often get distracted or hit writer&#8217;s block, so I&#8217;m considering the approach of setting aside a little bit of time every day to write with no background music/videos, as opposed to my previous strategy of writing in big time chunks all at once.

Many hours of my weekends have been devoted to building up my distance; I am a longtime runner, but had never ran more than a half-marathon before my marathon training this year. Last weekend I did my longest run, a 23.2-miler (my poor legs), and I&#8217;m now tapering down before the big day. My mental health has been low recently, and the marathon has been a good target for my mind to try and focus on, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14584" height="560" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025"><em>https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025</em></a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m both excited and nervous for the event, for which I will be journeying to Edinburgh a few days beforehand. I&#8217;m also doing the run to fundraise for <a href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/">Beat, the Eating Disorder charity</a> &#8211; this is a cause close to my heart, as my amazing sister Charlotte passed away in 2007 after battling anorexia. As aforementioned in my previous post, you can view my Justgiving page <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/william-robinson-edinburgh-2025">at this link</a>, and any donations would be very much appreciated, but there&#8217;s no pressure at all to donate!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Upcoming Book Projects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a designer for Titan Books, I get to work on some really exciting projects, and honestly that fulfilment in my work means a lot to me &#8211; it&#8217;s very rewarding to have a physical product of your work, especially when it&#8217;s related to a property (such as Marvel or <em>Star Trek</em>) that you enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get to experience working on several exciting film retrospectives, and some upcoming ones from Titan include books on <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>,<em> </em>The Crow films, and <em>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</em>, which you can see covers for below!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-24 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14562" height="904" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706" width="706" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14564" height="1024" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800" width="800" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-14563" height="927" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of fiction, the final Mike Hammer novel <em>Baby, It&#8217;s Murder</em> released recently, and there are upcoming Marvel paperbacks for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Annihilation</em> and <em>Doctor Strange: Dimension Wa</em>r.

I&#8217;m very impressed by what was shown, and have my pre-order in for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. Whilst I like physical media, I can&#8217;t justify that high £74.99 price point for buying <em>Mario Kart</em> separately. Those game prices are the main criticism so far &#8211; the only other hesitation is seeing Nintendo choose surety over innovation in terms of hardware. I&#8217;m confident the Switch 2 will be a huge hit, but I do slightly miss those eclectic reveals of the Wii U, 3DS, Wii, DS, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what I&#8217;m playing, I&#8217;ve been struggling with burnout and game-playing-motivation recently, so haven&#8217;t played much. I have however briefly gotten back into<em> Bravely Default</em> on the DS (which ironically has a Switch 2 version coming soon), and continue to play <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel </em>now and then. I&#8217;m hoping my game-playing motivation returns soon, but am also not putting too much pressure on myself, as I don&#8217;t want to force it. I look forward to the Switch 2 hopefully reigniting that fire a bit &#8211; oh, and please add Captain Toad to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, Nintendo! It would make me very happy indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">What I&#8217;m Watching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve admittedly struggled to get back into games recently &#8211; but when it comes to TV, I&#8217;ve been keeping more up-to-date, and there&#8217;s a lot that I&#8217;ve been liking recently! The second season of <em>Andor </em>and second (or fifteenth, depending on how you count) season of <em>Doctor Who</em> are currently airing, and both are fantastic. <em>Andor </em>continues the engrossing drama and brilliantly tangible visual design of the first season, and this era of <em>Doctor Who</em> is really hitting a stride, with unexpected surprises amidst the brilliantly imaginative stories. I really hope the rumours of <em>Doctor Who</em> taking a break after this season are false, as Ncuti Gatwa is sensational, portraying a charismatic and emotionally healed Doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also just finished watching through <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Netflix-verse of Marvel TV (especially<em> Jessica Jones</em>), so to see some of those characters returning has been wonderful. The series feels like both a reinvention and a continuation of the original three <em>Daredevil </em>seasons, and I&#8217;ve been thrilled by how well it has turned out. The character work, cinematography, and courtroom/political intrigue is all here, and I am stoked for Season 2 &#8211; I just hope some of the Defenders do turn up in Season 2, including not just Jessica Jones, but Luke Cage and Iron Fist too!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a quick rundown on what I&#8217;ve been doing, playing, and watching! I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this quick update &#8211; I think of this site like my own digital journal, so even when I take a break, I always like to come back with some sort of update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really hope you are happy and healthy, and that you are having a wonderful week. See you next time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/05/04/blog-update-marathon-training-the-switch-2-what-im-watching-more/feed/', 'slash_comments': '5', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/captain-toad-run-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/justgiving.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nightofthelivingdeadsalescoverdraft_bqbp4xv.jpg?w=706', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thecrow_definitivehistory.jpg?w=800', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfs.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mikehammer_babyitsmurder_fc.jpg?w=666', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/81tvyzi3mvl._sl1500_.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doctorstrange_dimensionwar_salescover-1.jpg?w=678', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/godzillamovienovelization_omnibus_salescvr_dec24.jpg?w=672', 'medium': 'image'}]}

So, any omissions are not necessarily a negative reflection on that game &#8211; more likely, it just didn&#8217;t make the cut for this post, especially as I want to take this chance to include expansions that don&#8217;t always get the limelight they deserve. It&#8217;s been hard cutting it down to six choices!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summation, this list isn&#8217;t a definitive ranking, but instead a personalised list of six brilliant game expansions that I&#8217;d like to give some attention to, and explain why I have a personal connection with. Also, please go and read the original article that inspired me over at Game Praisers, which you can do <a href="https://gamepraisers.wordpress.com/2024/12/18/the-best-expansions/">by clicking here</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right then &#8211; onto my list!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/01/29/horizon-zero-dawn-review/">greatly enjoyed <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a>, it didn&#8217;t take much convincing for me to download the expansion <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>! With such an expansive and imaginative open world, it&#8217;s a double-edged sword when it comes to DLC; on one hand, you know people like this world, but on the other, you really have to make the expansion stand out from that world to set it apart. For <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, this is done with a new area named The Cut, full of cold weather, dangerous new machines such as the Scorcher, and intriguing story reveals that bridge the gap between <em>Zero Dawn</em> and the sequel <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2023/03/30/horizon-forbidden-west-review/">Forbidden West</a></em> (incidentally, the only reason I haven&#8217;t included the <em>Forbidden West</em> DLC on this list is because I don&#8217;t have a PS5 to play it on)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cut is full of activities for main character Aloy, whether it be exploration, narrative, or combat &#8211; including optional super-hard combat trials for the real masochists among us. The local tribe (named the Banuk) tie into the aforementioned overarching story, and as Aloy discovers literal machinations under the snow-covered surface of The Cut, it increased my anticipation around where the sequel will go next &#8211; which is surely a sign of a successful DLC. When I wrote <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2018/02/14/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds-review/">my review for <em>The Frozen Wilds</em></a> back in 2018, I also noted how it made small steps to improve dialogue animations (which were sometimes quite static in the main game), and you can see how that was continued to full fruition in the dynamic conversations of <em>Forbidden West</em>. Not only is <em>The Frozen Wilds</em> substantial and utterly beautiful to look at, but it actively improves the gameplay foundation of a series I adore.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Mass Effect 3: Leviathan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious choices when it comes to <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC are the fantastic <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> for <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, or the <em>Citadel </em>DLC that served as an epilogue for <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. However, the expansion I have the strongest personal connection to is <em>Leviathan</em>, the first of the <em>Mass Effect 3</em> DLCs. I only bought an Xbox 360 shortly before <em>Mass Effect 3</em> launched, and that game was my gateway into the series (I went back and played the entire trilogy afterwards). After mainly playing on Nintendo consoles beforehand, the concept of single-player expansions was relatively foreign to me &#8211; but after being so enraptured by <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, I was incredibly excited at the prospect of more story content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ending of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is infamous for being disappointing to many people &#8211; but in a way, it made me more excited for DLC that would further flesh out the backstory of the giant world-destroying Reapers that you face throughout the trilogy. <em>Leviathan </em>is all about the discovery of a secret race named (you guessed it) Leviathans, who predate even the mysterious Reapers. In the DLC, you journey across space to piece together morsels of information about their origins. I particularly like the planet 2181 Despoina, a planet covered in water and full of secrets and intense combat situations. That sense of discovering places that were meant to be hidden forever is thrilling, especially when you get to the climactic moments that reveal how the Leviathans play into the wider battle against the Reapers &#8211; and it&#8217;s that rush of energy that makes <em>Leviathan </em>stand out as my favourite <em>Mass Effect</em> DLC.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker &#8211; Special Episode</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very happy when <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> got a Switch release, as it allowed even more people to play this gem of a game &#8211; and I was even happier when in early 2019, a new selection of levels was added with the <em>Special Episode</em> expansion! Whilst this isn&#8217;t a large single-player story expansion like some of the other games I&#8217;ve included in this list, I wanted to highlight this DLC for <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, as it&#8217;s a joyful addition with plenty of value for money (currently £5.39 on Switch). Also, yes, I&#8217;m biased for Captain Toad, but that&#8217;s besides the point, aha&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who haven&#8217;t played <em>Treasure Tracker</em>, it&#8217;s a delightful puzzle game that sees Captain Toad and Toadette make their way through levels based on Hakoniwa Japanese box gardens, with the player rotating and shifting the levels around in order to progress. The <em>Special Episode</em> adds 5 brand new levels and 13 challenges that reinvent previous courses, so 18 new levels to play through in total. As with the main game, there&#8217;s a lovely variety, from haunted caves full of Boos, to a treacherous ship, to another minecart ride! As <em>Treasure Tracker</em> is presented in several book chapters, the DLC additions fit in smoothly, and I&#8217;d frankly happily play as many levels as Nintendo is happy to add (I really hope we get a sequel one day)! The <em>Special Episode</em> is a wonderful and endearing addition to <em>Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Dragon Age: Inquisition &#8211; Trespasser</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a brilliant time with all of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> DLCs, but it&#8217;s the final DLC <em>Trespasser </em>that&#8217;s my favourite of the bunch. Requiring story completion to play, it&#8217;s a definitive end &#8211; and cliffhanger &#8211; to <em>Inquisition</em>, even preventing you from returning to the main game afterwards. The plot brings the player to a summit assembled to decide what happens to the Inquisition now that the main threat has been ended, but soon a new conspiracy is discovered. This eventually reveals that Solas (an eleven mage who&#8217;s a consistent presence in the <em>Dragon Age</em> series) is secretly Fen&#8217;Harel and the Dread Wolf. He&#8217;s been responsible for many of the magical occurrences that have played a part in the game, and he&#8217;s now seeking to collapse the Veil that separates worlds, despite the catastrophic consequences it&#8217;d cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For players who&#8217;ve spent many hours around this character who they thought was on their side, it&#8217;s a dramatic reveal that created a lot of excitement for the sequel to <em>Inquisition</em>. Solas even cuts off the arm of the main character to prevent them stopping him, before disappearing and leaving the player with the decision of whether the Inquisition should be continued or disbanded. <em>Trespasser </em>does have competent combat elements too, but the story is the focus here, and it&#8217;s always been memorable thanks to the anticipation it created for the sequel. However, despite <em>Trespasser </em>releasing in 2015, we only got <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2024/08/04/dragon-age-the-veilguard-why-im-optimistic-what-id-like-to-see-next/">The Veilguard</a></em> at the end of 2024, so it did leave a lot of time for players to stew and theorize!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">Resident Evil 5: Lost in Nightmares/Desperate Escape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I first played <em><a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/02/resident-evil-5-review/">Resident Evil 5</a></em> in 2020, and I did so on PS4, where both the DLC expansions <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> and <em>Desperate Escape</em> are bundled in with the main game, so I&#8217;m going to include them both together for the purposes of this list. Whilst <em>Resident Evil 5</em> certainly has flaws, it also has a lot to praise, such as how it leans into cinematic storytelling. The two DLCs act as a prequel and an in-between-quel, and give an opportunity to play as series mainstay (and <a href="https://wcrobinson.org/2021/05/23/my-5-favourite-video-game-characters/">my favourite <em>Resident Evil</em> character</a>) Jill Valentine, as well as the pilot Josh Stone. Firstly, <em>Lost in Nightmares</em> is set before <em>Resident Evil 5</em>, and shows Jill and Chris Redfield infiltrating the Spencer estate to confront Albert Wesker. We see snippets of this encounter &#8211; which leaves Jill presumed dead &#8211; during the main game as flashbacks, but here we get to play through it all: puzzles, combat, and Wesker boss fight included. Jill and Chris are the quintessential <em>Resident Evil</em> partners, so it&#8217;s comforting to see them interact (well, as comforting as it can be when facing down monstrosities).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Desperate Escape</em> is set towards the end of the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> campaign, just after Sheva Alomar and Chris manage to free Jill from the mind control of Wesker. Whilst the former pair go after Wesker in the main game, we never got to see how Jill and Josh made their own way out, and we get to play that out for ourselves here. This is arguably the tougher DLC of the two, less puzzle-focused and more about, well, desperately escaping &#8211; ending with a horde-assault sequence that gets frenetic on the higher difficulties. Both DLCs are great for different reasons, and as a combo add a lot to the <em>Resident Evil 5</em> story experience. Jill getting her time to shine is great too, especially as she wasn&#8217;t playable in the main game. This is timeline-wise the last time we got to play as Jill in the main story, too &#8211; please take the hint, Capcom&#8230; !</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The Last of Us: Left Behind</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You knew this had to be on here, right? In my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> rose the bar for story expansions, just like <em>The Last of Us</em> rose the bar for narrative video games. <em>Left Behind</em> fits into the later portions of <em>The Last of Us</em>, after Joel is near-fatally injured, and Ellie is hunting for medical supplies in an abandoned mall. This forms part of Left Behind, but it&#8217;s also interspersed with flashbacks to three weeks before the main game, where Ellie is taken by her friend Riley to break into another abandoned mall in Boston &#8211; and this is where the DLC shines at its brightest. As with many of the other expansions in my list, the core gameplay is a solid continuation of the main game, but it&#8217;s the story advancements and believable character interactions which leave the strongest impact here, giving us brand new information on Elie and her backstory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the best parts of the DLC aren&#8217;t fighting infected, but instead when Riley and Ellie are exploring the desolate mall. They find carousels, video games, and plenty more to play with and talk about. The in-gameplay dialogue that <em>The Last of Us</em> uses so well is continued here, resulting in a moment between the two girls that is both natural and surprising, especially for blockbuster games at the time. It&#8217;s all interwoven with that bittersweet sense that something bad is going to happen &#8211; after all, this is an apocalyptic world, we didn&#8217;t hear much about Riley in the main game, and we know Ellie gets bitten at some point. Those moments do come, but they maintain all their dramatic impact because of the masterful way Naughty Dog combines gameplay and narrative (and also because of brilliant performances by Yaani King as Riley and Ashley Johnson as Ellie). As I said at the start &#8211; in my opinion, <em>Left Behind</em> raised the bar for story expansions, and it&#8217;s still one of my favourites to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>With that, we come to the end of the list! As mentioned earlier, there are plenty other great DLC expansions out there, but these are six of my own favourites, each for their own specific reasons. Thanks again to Dryad at Game Praisers for the inspiration for this post!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this also got you thinking about your own favourite gaming expansions &#8211; I&#8217;d love to hear about your picks, so please feel free to let me know in the comments!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have an amazing week!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/03/09/6-of-my-favourite-video-game-expansions/feed/', 'slash_comments': '6', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/expansions.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/expansions.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Therefore, I thought I&#8217;d give a quick overview of what&#8217;s been added to the game and why I&#8217;ve found it so rewarding!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Look to the Skies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s immediately obvious which archetype Konami is pushing with this event &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the Sky Strikers, who were introduced back in 2018 and have become incredibly popular since. The first two <em>Master Duel </em>anniversaries tied into Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so it&#8217;s admittedly a shame we don&#8217;t have a Red-Eyes Black Dragon event to round out the central three <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> Duel Monsters characters of Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey &#8211; but I suppose the power of the fan-favourite Sky Striker characters Raye and Roze was just too strong!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14502" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14515" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png" width="2560" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14519" height="1440" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png" width="2560" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop is filled with new items featuring board backgrounds, player mates, card backs, a deck box, and more focused around the Sky Strikers, plus admittedly stunning alternate arts for the main Sky Striker cards. I&#8217;m not an expert on the archetype, but all the amazing artwork and shiny bonuses definitely has me intrigued to learn more about the characters!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of&#8230; The new solo Story is unsurprisingly focused around the Sky Strikers. However, what makes this even more special is the addition of animated sequences within the Sky Striker story, which have been taken from the upcoming anime <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME: THE CHRONICLES</em>. For those who don&#8217;t know, Konami recently announced that this anime will be starting in April 2025, and will be focused on the actual card lore itself. So, instead of revolving around duels (like <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</em>, <em>5D&#8217;s</em>, or <em>Arc-V</em> did, for example), <em>CHRONICLES </em>will be set within the world of the cards, which is very exciting! It&#8217;s been announced that these episodes will include the archetypes Fall of Albaz, Dogmatika Ecclesia, and yes &#8211; Sky Strikers!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14505" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14507" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14508" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing small clips of the anime in the <em>Master Duel</em> solo mode was unexpected, and acts as a lovely tease of what&#8217;s to come. The animation is vibrant and expressive, and it&#8217;s great to see this willingness to expand on the card lore &#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely be checking these anime episodes out as they release. Also I have to mention that the new UI for the solo mode is much improved and more player-friendly, segmenting the various solo stories up in a cleaner way, which I appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Festival Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next major addition to <em>Master Duel</em> is the two Festivals that are happening this month &#8211; the first one, Legend Anthology, features a custom banlist that excludes common staples, such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. In theory, this shakes up the meta within the mode, especially with three pre-made decks ready for players to use. However, this mode is dominated by the new Exodia deck and cards, in particular The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate, which can reach upwards of 10000 ATK and can also negates card effects. Often, the match is decided on the coin flip, as if a player goes first and gets out this Exodia card, it&#8217;s extremely hard to the opponent to stage a comeback. Still, the mode has plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, so it&#8217;s worth grinding through.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14511" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14510" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14509" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m much more excited for the upcoming Fusion X Synchro Festival (starting 17th February), which will restrict the Extra Deck to only Synchro/Fusion monsters, and cut out all the options that Link and XYZ monsters have added. I&#8217;m growing to respect those newer card types more over time, but it&#8217;ll still be fun to play some games that make players revert to pre-XYZ strategies. Hopefully it&#8217;ll allow some of my older classic decks to be a bit more viable (at least briefly)! Just like the Legend Anthology, there are plenty of Gem and cosmetic rewards, which should make it worth the playtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" style="font-size: 24px;">Plenty of Prizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that has always pleasantly surprised me about <em>Master Duel</em> is how generous it is as a Free-to-Play game. The 3rd Anniversary is timed with the start of a new Duel Pass, which is a 700-Gem purchase that &#8211; if you complete it &#8211; earns you all your Gems back, as well as cosmetic and in-game currency rewards, such as a background themed around the aforementioned Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate. If I had to suggest improvements, it would be for a few more unique cosmetic rewards in the Pass &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to complain too much about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the Sky Striker items I mentioned earlier, the shop also has a new Structure Deck full of the expensive HERO cards, new Selection Packs that include those new Exodia cards, as well as another chance to buy previous Anniversary-exclusive items themed around Blue-Eyes White Dragon. As someone who took a long break from <em>Master Duel</em>, I appreciate this a lot, and am slowly working my way through acquiring these.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14517" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14512" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-14514" height="485" src="https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863" width="863" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The deck that&#8217;s currently giving me the most success is my anti-meta Gravekeeper deck, which I&#8217;ve fine-tuned to include more drawing cards and be more reliable (see the decklist image above). I&#8217;ve also finally put together my Destiny HERO deck, which is more meta, and features more Extra Deck combo cards. For long-term success in <em>Master Duel</em>, I need to learn more of these combo plays (and how to combat other combo decks), so I don&#8217;t want to stick with anti-meta decks like Gravekeepers for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my quick summation of the new <em>Master Duel</em> features and how they&#8217;ve positively affected the game &#8211; I&#8217;m really enjoying the amount to do right now, as well as the continued support Konami is bringing. I&#8217;m still slowly re-acclimatising myself to <em>Master Duel</em> after such a long time away, but I&#8217;m continuing to enjoy it and play a few duels every day. If anyone else is intrigued in giving the game a shot, I&#8217;d say now is an ideal time to jump on board, as the game is offering many player-friendly rewards that not only play on nostalgia for <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em>, but also relate to future projects like the <em>CHRONICLES </em>anime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this quick article &#8211; and if you&#8217;re playing <em>Master Duel</em>, let me know how you&#8217;re finding it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next post, I hope you&#8217;re happy and healthy, and that you have a great week!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wcrobinson.org/2025/02/16/yu-gi-oh-master-duels-3rd-anniversary-celebration-is-brilliantly-rewarding/feed/', 'slash_comments': '1', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sky-striker-featured.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/843326e53392ce48b92a735deeb5853c63b7d2cb4afaa77f59e83c6bf9b657f1?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1593.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1592.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1610-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1596.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1598.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1605.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1608.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1609.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1607.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1613.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1611.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wcrobinson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-1591.png?w=863', 'medium': 'image'}]}

In my defense, some of the thinking afterward warranted a bit of a cooling off period to be better informed, but now it’s time.</p>\n<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>\n<p>Waaaaay back when I first started this adventure, I wrote about <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-goals/" title="Blaugust 2025: Goals | Blog | Nik Kantar">what I was hoping to get out of it</a>. In short, I primarily wanted to write more consistently, and presumably publish more frequently as a result. Has that actually happened in the time since? Well, yes and no.</p>\n<p>Yes, because I’ve certainly been writing and publishing more than in the literal <em>eleven months</em> preceding the challenge, when I wrote and published <em>zero posts</em>. But also no, because I haven’t been particularly consistent.</p>\n<p>Blaugust was a lot of work for me, and involved quite a bit of sacrificing of other things in my life. Don’t worry; none were catastrophic, but by the end I felt significant relief that I could stop, and I think I needed a bit of a break. I’m feeling more inspired to get back to it now, so I think it’s at least a partial win.</p>\n<h2 id="achievements">Achievements</h2>\n<p>As <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/10/blaugust-2025-is-coming/" title="Blaugust 2025 is Coming! – Nerd Girl Thoughts">Krikket outlined</a> at the beginning, Blaugust comes with some lighthearted achievements. I qualified for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Newbie Blogger Award</strong> — awarded to first-time Blaugust participants</li>\n<li><strong>Rainbow Diamond Award</strong> — awarded to those posting 31 or more posts during August</li>\n<li><strong>Community Builder Award</strong> — awarded to those meeting at least three of the following criteria:<ul>\n<li>minumum Silver Award post count (15) — ✔️</li>\n<li>at least 5 posts directly inspired by another Blaugust participant, with links to original posts — if we were to count link roundups (<a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-1/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 1 | Blog | Nik Kantar">1</a>, <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-2/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 2 | Blog | Nik Kantar">2</a>, <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-3/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 3 | Blog | Nik Kantar">3</a>, <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/10/blaugust-2025-links-part-4/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 4 | Blog | Nik Kantar">4</a>), I’d check this one too</li>\n<li>weekly engagement with other Blaugust participants, via reading, commenting, discussing on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/KAXgK2E" title="Join the official Blaugust Discord server">Discord</a>, or sharing on social media — ✔️</li>\n<li>guest post on another Blaugust participant’s blog or vice versa — antithetical  to my <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-no-comments/" title="Blaugust 2025: No Comment(s) | Blog | Nik Kantar">thoughts on comments</a></li>\n<li>create or join a group project — ✔️</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’d say I did a pretty kick-ass job.</p>\n<p><img alt="Blaugust 2025 achievements" src="https://nkantar.com/static/media/2025/10/blaugust-2025-achievements.png" /></p>\n<h2 id="community">Community</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The real treasure was the friends we made along the way.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I jest, but it’s true. My favorite part of Blaugust was reading the flurry of posts everyone was sharing on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/KAXgK2E" title="Join the official Blaugust Discord server">Discord</a>, talking about them on there, responding to them in my own posts, and looking forward to reading what increasingly familiar names wrote day to day. It’s definitely gotten quieter after the conclusion, naturally, but I still check in from time to time.</p>\n<p>A few blogs made it onto my <a href="https://nkantar.com/blogroll/" title="Blogroll | Nik Kantar">blogroll</a> already, but I need to go through the aforementioned link posts and add a few more. And I think I’ll go through the <a href="https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/08/27/blaugust-motivation-where-do-all-these-words-come-from/#:~:text=Here%20is%20the%20list%20if%20you%20want%20to%20go%20find%20out%3A" title="Blaugust Motivation – Where Do All These Words Come From? | The Ancient Gaming Noob">full list</a> at some point as well and see if any strike a chord with me.</p>\n<p>I’m still on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/KAXgK2E" title="Join the official Blaugust Discord server">Discord</a> server, though I haven’t participated much since the finale. Sometimes it’s hard to keep up with all the various communities, but the Blaugust one is up there, and I don’t want to just go fully silent.</p>\n<h2 id="again">Again?</h2>\n<p>So, will I do it again next year? I genuinely don’t know. Getting the full 31 posts was a lot, and I’m not eager to skimp on sleep and whatever else to get that again, so maybe I need to set myself a lower goal, and perhaps have some ideas (and notes?) ahead of time. Or maybe I just keep doing what I’m doing and play along that way—the community was just as welcoming to those who only eked out a few posts as it was to me and my full slate.</p>\n<p>Maybe I’ll choose a listicle-like theme, like “31 small Python libraries I love”. Maybe I’ll do something silly like <em>only</em> writing posts in response to others’. Posting more of a daily journal/diary could be fun, too. The possibilities are nearly literally endless!</p>\n<p>I think it’s highly unlikely I won’t participate at all. Regardless of how much of my own writing finds its way onto published pages, I expect I’ll be keeping a close eye on what others post at least.</p>\n<p>And yes, you should totally play along. If you do, I’ll play along with you. 😉</p>\n<hr /><p><em>Thanks for reading!

Inspired—and admittedly slightly indignant, perhaps—I thought “surely I can make this happen” and registered <code>pybeach.org</code> before I’d even left the Bay Area.</p>\n<p>A little over two years later, on February 29th, 2020, <a href="https://2020.pybeach.org/" title="PyBeach 2020: Saturday, February 29, 2020, Los Angeles, California">PyBeach 2020</a> happened, with  plenty of community support, but still primarily as my baby. It was a great time, with around 40 attendees present for a day of fantastic talks, and the plan was to keep going. Since the event happened on a leap day, I obviously joked along the lines of “that was a lot of work, so maybe I’ll see y’all back in four years”, and I deeply apologize if I manifested what subsequently transpired.</p>\n<p>As hosting in-person events started becoming at least somewhat sensible from 2023 or thereabouts, I’d wanted to bring PyBeach back. Organizing a conference is indeed quite a bit of work, and it all starts with a venue and dates, with everything else subject to that combination. As I vaguely attempted to solve that problem on my own for over a year, <a href="https://2025.pybeach.org/organizers.html" title="PyBeach 2025">two awesome people</a> in the Python world got in touch and wanted to get involved.</p>\n<p>We started as a triumvirate, but over the ensuing months, <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2023/11/masking-is-inclusivity/#why-i-care" title="Masking Is Inclusivity | Blog | Nik Kantar">personal circumstances</a> rendered me disproportionally unhelpful. After much stressing over letting them down, I decided the best thing I could do was to officially hand over the reigns and get out of their way, so I did just that.</p>\n<p>They kept running with it and put on a kick-ass event. <a href="https://2025.pybeach.org/" title="PyBeach 2025">PyBeach 2025</a> happened on September 27th, and it was a blast.</p>\n<h2 id="the-event">The Event</h2>\n<p>PyBeach 2025 was <em>awesome</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt="PyBeach 2025 schedule of events" src="https://nkantar.com/static/media/2025/09/pybeach-2025-schedule.jpg" title="PyBeach 2025 schedule of events" /></p>\n<p>The talks were fantastic, and I kept overhearing people referencing them throughout the day. I watched a few, and really appreciated <a href="https://www.willingconsulting.com/" title="Willing Consulting">Carol Willing’s</a> opening keynote about asking questions. The slate that followed was of the highest caliber. The talks were recorded using the venue’s setup, and the viability of the recordings is still unknown, but if they make their way to the public, you should give them a watch. I know I will for the ones I missed.</p>\n<p>The <del>hallway</del> lobby track was exciting and lively. I got to chat with some old acquaintances and make new ones. This is arguably my favorite part of every conference, and it delivered.</p>\n<p>The food track was also top notch. The dinner the night before the event, lunch, and dinner after all involved excellent company to go with great food and drinks. Santa Monica fortunately has plenty of great dining options, so we were well covered. And as much as I appreciate the thought behind being fed, I tend to strongly prefer eating out around the event whenever possible, so I get to experience the locale a bit.</p>\n<p>The vibe was awesome. This energy is why I go to conferences—around twenty by now—and why I started one. It’s why I got involved with organizing <a href="https://socalpython.org/" title="SoCal Python | The official site of the Los Angeles Python programming language community.">SoCal Python</a>, and why I want it to come back. In my eyes a well-run event lets the people present make it great, and this was a shining example.</p>\n<h2 id="the-feelings">The Feelings</h2>\n<p><img alt="my PyBeach 2025 badge" src="https://nkantar.com/static/media/2025/09/pybeach-2025-badge.jpg" title="my PyBeach 2025 badge" /></p>\n<p>Early in the day I <a href="https://nkantar.social/@nik/115277491693541529#." title="Nik Kantar :pybeach:: &quot;Many feelings today, all posit…&quot; - nkantar.social">tooted</a> a photo of my badge with the “Volunteer” ribbon and captioned it with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Many feelings today, all positive.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was a pretty emotional experience to be involved and see the event flourish.</p>\n<p>At <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2018/" title="PyCon 2018 in Cleveland, Ohio | May 9-17">PyCon 2018</a> I was in a community organizing open space, and someone said “your conference can be 40 people in a room”. I took this wisdom to heart, and PyBeach 2020 was just that. I basically wanted a conference that’s convenient for me and serves Southern California. If it had remained “40 people in a room” forever, it still would’ve been great. To see it double was gratifying in a way I didn’t anticipate.</p>\n<p>It was also extremely gratifying to see it thrive “without me”, so to speak. I helped a little bit with the t-shirts, assembled one of the Corsi-Rosenthal boxes, staffed the registration desk for part of the afternoon, and helped with the cleanup. While that’s not nothing, it’s also not even a little bit like organizing, and anyone could’ve done it instead.</p>\n<p>There was something special in seeing a thing I started take a life of its own and grow, through hard work and care of others. There is perhaps no better testament to the value of said thing and the power of the community than this happening, and it is my proudest professional achievement.</p>\n<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>\n<p>I don’t know if and when the next PyBeach will happen. The organizers expressed interest in not doing it again all by themselves, and I hope someone else will step up. I also hope to continue to be involved, but don’t want to try taking on more than I can handle, especially as the personal side of my life isn’t really changing for the better. I remember during the lead-up to the original event thinking that it would be nice if PyBeach traveled—as <a href="https://www.pycascades.com/" title="Home — PyCascades">PyCascades</a> does between Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland—primarily with <a href="https://www.sandiegopython.org/" title="Home · San Diego Python">San Diego Python</a> in mind, but we also have Orange County, Ventura, and Santa Barbara roughly within the same geographic area, so there are some other candidates for that approach as well.</p>\n<p>And if it doesn’t pan out, it will be a shame, but I’ll be proud of the role I played in what this community I so dearly love made happen twice.</p>\n<p>But I think we can figure something out. And I hope to see you there.</p>\n<p><img alt="presentation slide with the PyBeach logo and caption enjoy the ride" src="https://nkantar.com/static/media/2025/09/pybeach-2025-enjoy-the-ride.jpg" title="enjoy the ride" /></p>\n<hr /><p><em>Thanks for reading!

I’ve made it. <em>We</em>’ve made it.</p>\n<p>I have a few more Blaugust related posts in the pipeline—namely the last link roundup (following on parts <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-1/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 1 | Blog | Nik Kantar">one</a>, <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-2/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 2 | Blog | Nik Kantar">two</a>, and <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-3/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 3 | Blog | Nik Kantar">three</a>) as well as some sort of summary of general feelings and <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-goals/" title="Blaugust 2025: Goals | Blog | Nik Kantar">goals</a> and stuff—but today is about some things I’d suggest to someone looking to <del>take on</del> survive Blaugust. This someone could’ve easily been myself a month ago.</p>\n<h2 id="pre-write">Pre-Write</h2>\n<p>I was more interested in building a solid writing habit than specifically publishing a bunch of content, so I started off writing and posting on the same day. This went fine for maybe a couple of weeks, but eventually Life™ got a little tricky, and I found myself writing the day before publishing, which still had the same effect. Ultimately I ended up with a few non-writing days here and there, which is a pretty great result overall.</p>\n<p>I really liked writing the day/night before and publishing in the morning, and if I were to do this again with this same goal of writing consistently, I’d strive for that. But that’s a pretty intense schedule for someone trying to squeeze this in after work, family, and other obligations, so doing a bit more pre-writing is probably more sustainable. Writing enough on the weekend to skip two or three weekdays during the following week sounds like a good approach.</p>\n<h2 id="stash-easy-ideas">Stash Easy Ideas</h2>\n<p>Publishing an easy one here and there is nothing to be ashamed of, I think. The <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/iphone-home-screen-tour/" title="iPhone Home Screen Tour | Blog | Nik Kantar">home screen tour</a> and <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-the-blog-questions-challenge/" title="Blaugust 2025: The Blog Questions Challenge | Blog | Nik Kantar">blog questions challenge</a> come to mind. I’d decided to do these each a few days before I actually did, and had them at the ready for days when I couldn’t write anything more substantial. I did my best to make them worthwhile, but recognize they were essentially little “breaks”.</p>\n<h2 id="lower-your-standards">Lower Your Standards</h2>\n<p>Now, to be clear, I’m not suggesting you throw your standards in the trash wholesale. That would be a bummer, and likely not a price worth paying just to stick to the schedule.</p>\n<p>I’m merely suggesting you consider allowing yourself to publish posts you might not think are your absolute best, or even posts you think you could improve, which you probably could, but there’s only so much time, so don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Sometimes a <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-regressed-expectations/" title="Blaugust 2025: Regressed Expectations | Blog | Nik Kantar">mostly baked thought</a> is OK and you’ll be forgiven for foisting it upon your readers.</p>\n<h2 id="revisit-old-ideas">Revisit Old Ideas</h2>\n<p>If you have old ideas you wanted to write about, this could be a great opportunity to dust them off. I found the pressure of not having all that much time to be a great motivator to let go of the notion that these old notes or drafts might turn into something truly world changing and just publish <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-stop-pleasing-deathbed-you/" title="Blaugust 2025: Stop Pleasing Deathbed You | Blog | Nik Kantar">something decent</a>.</p>\n<h2 id="play-along">Play Along</h2>\n<p>Participating in group projects is great. I hadn’t really ever done anything like it before, and it was a fun experience. For me the prompts solved half of my usual problem—what to write about—letting me figure out the answer. It was also super fun to read others’ takes on the same day, generally after posting mine. I got to post some <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-all-about-that-bassline/" title="Blaugust 2025: All About That Bass(line) | Blog | Nik Kantar">music</a>, a <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-low-stakes-hot-take/" title="Blaugust 2025: Low Stakes Hot Take | Blog | Nik Kantar">hot take</a>, and a <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-small-joys-big-smiles/" title="Blaugust 2025: Small Joys, Big Smiles | Blog | Nik Kantar">screen recording of a game</a> as a result, none of which I would’ve done on my own.</p>\n<h2 id="blog-back">Blog Back</h2>\n<p>In addition to planned group projects, I found it fun to just <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/digital-and-analog-writing/" title="Digital and Analog Writing | Blog | Nik Kantar">respond to others’ posts</a>. This is especially great if the original author doesn’t have comments on their blog, which tends to be quite a few people, myself included. I stand by <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-no-comments/" title="Blaugust 2025: No Comment(s) | Blog | Nik Kantar">my reasons</a>, but will almost certainly want to read any post inspired by my own.</p>\n<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>\n<p>The <a href="https://discord.com/invite/VyJAnQ8Bhg" title="Blaugust Discord server">official Blaugust Discord server</a> is pretty great. I’ve immensely enjoyed conversing with other participants in real-time(ish), and the energy has helped me keep going when things got a bit dicey a few times. The community is lovely and helpful. Bonus: this is where I found the group projects.</p>\n<h2 id="let-it-go">Let It Go</h2>\n<p>This one is perhaps hypocritical, since I definitely sacrificed some sleep to the gods of consistency, but it’s OK not to hit all 31 (or however many you targeted) posts. It really is. You won’t be less of a person, whether you skip some days intentionally or unintentionally. Blaugust is ostensibly about posting 31 times in 31 days, but deep down it’s about what <em>actually</em> works for you, and you get to decide that. Plenty of people haven’t hit their original goal, and that’s totally fine.</p>\n<h2 id="break-the-streak">Break the Streak</h2>\n<p>I’m intentionally breaking the streak on September 1st to avoid it becoming unhealthy. This may be wise for you as well.</p>\n<hr /><p><em>Thanks for reading!

Pretty soon he brought me under his wing as a co-organizer, and over the ensuing years we and others organized many SoCal Python events together, and even the inaugural PyBeach conference. His helpfulness and influence on everything he contributed to are hard to overstate. He was engaged in many other communities as well, and it’s no secret or surprise that many people active in them knew him and appreciated his work.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in there Michael and I became friends as well. I don’t know if he knew how to operate in any other way, and I think that line was rather blurred for him in general, since he always sought ways to help other people. The number of times I’ve witnessed him introduce two people to each other is beyond any count, and that’s basically what he was about: making connections. These connections lead to job opportunities, friendships, and who knows what else.</p>\n<p>The Southern California Python community has lost one of its major champions, and he will be greatly missed. Rest in peace, goodwill.</p>\n<p>— Nik Kantar, May 2025</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr /><p><em>Thanks for reading!

I’ve hosted my sites on several different PaaS platforms, and have used both cloud and self-hosted deployments of Plausible as well.

Exactly what was getting lost and where could’ve had multiple answers.</p>\n<p>After trying a bunch of different settings for Traefik, I tried a bunch of different things with headers in Caddy, and the missing magic turned out to be this line:</p>\n<div><pre>header_up X-Forwarded-For {http.request.header.X-Forwarded-For}\n</pre></div><p>It goes next to—e.g., below—the existing <code>header</code> directive, and it forwards the IP address of the original request to Plausible, instead of one of the internal addresses of the server/container/whatever. This unlocks location data with no other changes needed.</p>\n<p>A combination of Plausible’s <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/proxy/guides/nginx" title="Proxying Plausible through Nginx | Plausible docs">Nginx proxying guide</a> and Caddy’s <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/reverse_proxy" title="reverse_proxy (Caddyfile directive) — Caddy Documentation"><code>reverse_proxy</code> directive docs</a> were quite helpful, and thanks to <a href="https://tyrel.dev/" title="Tyrel Souza\'s Website">Tyrel</a> for pointing me in the general direction of forwarding headers.</p>\n<p>If you’ve got a similar setup and the same problem, hope this helps!</p>\n<hr /><p><em>Thanks for reading!

And speaking of firing, I was lucky enough to keep my job, and my employer was lucky enough to keep the customer.</p>\n<p>I won’t be naming any names here—except my own, obviously—so some details of the story have been changed to protect both the innocent and the guilty.

One of our customers had imported data into the platform, and much of the source text was entirely lowercase. Some of the data fields were things like names, where capitalization would be expected, so the experience really wasn’t ideal. We wanted to do them a solid by fixing it, because we were awesome like that—and because they asked us to do so—and I was tasked with creating a quick and dirty solution.</p>\n<p>The approach I came up with was reasonable, I think: I wrote a Python script that would read the table in question and write <code>UPDATE</code> SQL statements with values run through <code>str.capitalize()</code>—easy enough! There were quite a few columns, so I iterated through them, which Python makes super easy.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, I don’t have this snippet available, but it probably looked something like this (with the rows being queried from the DB):</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">COLUMNS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;person_name&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;company&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;category&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>\n\n<span class="n">rows</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>\n    <span class="p">{</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">313</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;person_name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;nik kantar&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;company&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;acme inc.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;count&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;status&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;legit&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;category&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;oopsies&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n    <span class="p">},</span>\n    <span class="p">{</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1024</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;person_name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ada lovelace&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;company&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;acme inc.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;count&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">24</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;status&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;legit&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;category&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;also oopsies&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n    <span class="p">},</span>\n    <span class="p">{</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">9001</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;person_name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;margaret hamilton&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;company&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;not acme inc.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;count&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;status&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;super legit&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n        <span class="s2">&quot;category&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;also oopsies&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>\n    <span class="p">},</span>\n<span class="p">]</span>\n\n<span class="n">statements</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>\n\n<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">rows</span><span class="p">:</span>\n    <span class="n">statement</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;UPDATE very_important_table SET &quot;</span>\n\n    <span class="n">updates</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>\n    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">column</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">COLUMNS</span><span class="p">:</span>\n        <span class="n">original_value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">column</span><span class="p">]</span>\n        <span class="n">parts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">original_value</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;

I ran the script, it generated the SQL, I ran that on the DB, and verified the results.</p>\n<p>Empowered by this massive success, I sent the Python script to the person who was going to run it on production data. They went through the process, but were too preoccupied to validate the changes on the spot, which wasn’t ideal, but our confidence about this fairly simple transformation was high.</p>\n<p>That is until a few moments later, when someone at the company told us they couldn’t access the single most important page in the product—powered by this very table—while logged in as that customer. <em>Uh-oh…</em></p>\n<p>A little bit later the person with access to production data was able to take a look, and, uhh, it wasn’t great: the table was full of values based on column names—that is, the <code>person_name</code> column had <code>&quot;Person_name&quot;</code> for every entry we updated, <code>company</code> was <code>&quot;Company&quot;</code>, and so on.</p>\n<p>It turned out that I did the equivalent of <code>original_value = column</code> instead of <code>original_value = row[column]</code> in whatever syntax I actually used. Such an easy mistake to make…but wait, didn’t I test this?!</p>\n<p>Well…yes, I did. But my test data was pretty awful. I was working with values extremely close to column names, like <code>&quot;person name&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;company&quot;</code>, so my sleepy eyes glazed over the differences. And my partner in crime didn’t verify the generated SQL before running it, since it was a lot more verbose and illegible than the sample above.</p>\n<p>We were very fortunate to have a backup recent enough that no changes to customer data had been made since. I fixed the script, we were able to run it on the backup table, and everything was fine.</p>\n<p>Ever since I’ve tried my best to use at least slightly more representative test data. If I at all can, I’ll make up realistic values for names, write full sentences for descriptions, and pick a variety of numerical values. Really, anything is better than <code>&quot;person name&quot;</code> for a column named <code>person_name</code>…</p>\n<hr /><p><em>Thanks for reading!

Fortunately the <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/25/blaugust-2025-calendar-weekly-prompts/" title="Blaugust 2025 – Calendar &amp; Weekly Prompts – Nerd Girl Thoughts">prompts</a> are here to help! Today I’m tackling the entire “Staying Motivated” week’s worth, since I don’t really think expanding each into its own post would go all that well for me.</p>\n<h2 id="what-tricks-do-you-use-to-keep-yourself-motivated-when-something-feels-impossible">What tricks do you use to keep yourself motivated when something feels impossible?</h2>\n<p>I don’t know that I have any general tricks, per se. I think I tend to bang my head against the wall in hopes the wall won’t be the one to prevail. I’d like to say that I think to myself “not trying guarantees failure, keep at it” or something equally poetic, but I’m not sure if that’s true. I definitely have a tendency to sacrifice sleep to get something done, though, and that strategy is only getting worse with age.</p>\n<p>Specific to Blaugust, though, the streak—which is <em>absolutely</em> a double-edged sword—has been astoundingly effective.</p>\n<h2 id="what-are-your-blogging-goals-do-you-think-participating-in-blaugust-is-getting-you-closer-to-where-you-want-be">What are your blogging goals? Do you think participating in Blaugust is getting you closer to where you want be?</h2>\n<p>I wanted to kickstart writing more, as I wrote in the <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-intro/" title="Blaugust 2025: Intro | Blog | Nik Kantar">intro post</a>. Given how well I’ve done at consistently writing about <em>something</em>, I’m quite optimistic about settling into a more reasonable cadence after the blognanza ends. I think that if I found a few hours every week to do some sort of writing, and published something worthwhile on average more than once per month, I’d be pretty stoked, and that feels very doable.</p>\n<h2 id="what-do-you-think-youll-get-out-of-completing-your-blaugust-goals">What do you think you’ll get out of completing your Blaugust goals?</h2>\n<p>The completionist in me is <em>beyond excited</em> to get <a href="https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/10/blaugust-2025-is-coming/" title="Blaugust 2025 is Coming! – Nerd Girl Thoughts">all the badges</a>, for sure. And the rest of me hopes that the hangup of only wanting to post epic pieces is significantly weakened, and I can just post what I want to post, even if it doesn’t stand a real chance of changing the world, which the forced “lower quality” of some of my Blaugust posts ought to achieve.</p>\n<h2 id="what-drives-you-to-blog">What drives you to blog?</h2>\n<p>Frankly, I’m not entirely sure.</p>\n<p>I’ve always enjoyed writing, first in Serbian and then in English. I used to read like a fiend, too.</p>\n<p>As I got older, I effectively stopped reading, and I’ve been trying to pick it back up for years, but it’s hard. For whatever reason, however, I kept writing. It’s mostly been blogging, but I also journal, write as much software documentation as I can justify, and generally enjoy typing things of all sorts.</p>\n<h2 id="are-you-happy-with-your-blaugust-so-far-if-so-why-if-not-why-not">Are you happy with your Blaugust so far? If so, why? If not, why not?</h2>\n<p>I’m <em>absolutely, positively thrilled</em>. This is the 26th post on the 26th day, and I’m immensely proud of myself for keeping it up, but also for keeping in mind that this pace is unsustainable and undesirable in the long run, and that I will adjust it as soon as we’re done here.</p>\n<p>10/10, no notes.</p>\n<h2 id="how-important-is-goal-setting-reaching-your-goals-to-you-overall">How important is goal setting &amp; reaching your goals to you overall?</h2>\n<p>Ha, I used to set <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/tags/goals/" title="Tag: goals | Nik Kantar">goals</a> of this sort regularly, and in the end it didn’t seem to make much difference. I’m sure the vague scope and expansive time frame of those was generally unhelpful, so I think that serves better as an example of what <em>not</em> to do than something that may lead to success.</p>\n<p>Hefty as the daily posting goal for Blaugust is, it’s made it very top-of-mind. I think goals only make sense if one doesn’t literally forget them, which I’ve done plenty with the aforementioned ones I’ve posted about here.</p>\n<p>I think I can take some lessons from Blaugust and apply them elsewhere, namely to scope my goals tighter in general.</p>\n<h2 id="did-you-read-any-posts-during-blaugust-or-before-that-you-found-particularly-inspirational-share-them">Did you read any posts during Blaugust (or before) that you found particularly inspirational? Share them!</h2>\n<p>I sure did, and I shared them <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-1/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 1 | Blog | Nik Kantar">three</a> <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-2/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 2 | Blog | Nik Kantar">times</a> <a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/blaugust-2025-links-part-3/" title="Blaugust 2025: Links Part 3 | Blog | Nik Kantar">already</a>.

Here’s the list of games I was playing throughout September:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#ggst">Guilty Gear Strive</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#sudoku">Sudoku</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; it was a bit of a light month. That’s entirely my fault.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ggst">Guilty Gear Strive</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m sure this will come as a surprise to no one: <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> dominated my gaming time throughout September. The addition of the <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/">newly improved ranked mode</a>, and proper matchmaking made <em>Strive </em>a lot more fun to play when compared against my previous experience with the game. Turns out I’ll actually stick around for longer sessions if I’m not constantly being bombarded by messages about connection failure. Who’d a thunk it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the main draw for my time commitment throughout September was twofold: updating my <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/01/19/guilty-gear-strive-may-guide-for-beginner-combos/">May Beginners Guide</a>, and playing more Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The May guide took about 10 days of on again, off again work to actually hammer through, but I’m fairly pleased with how it turned out. In general, I think the guide does a better job of handing new players safer combo routing that they can use as a springboard for playing May.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also ended up redoing all of the videos for said guide, which meant that I could finally remove all of the background noise. I didn’t even realize it, but <em>Strive </em>plays a wind sound effect passively in the background of every stage. Normally, this extra sound is imperceptible because of the game’s music, but it’s very apparent when you have said music muted so people can’t tell how often you’re cutting between shots in an edited combo video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, those videos feel like they’re better put together now. It was definitely worth the effort even though it took me over a day’s worth of effort to capture, edit, and render 22 new videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing the May guide, my attention fell squarely on Dizzy. Originally, I’d intended to keep bouncing back and forth between her, and May. However, I had so much fun playing Dizzy that I just kept playing her, and eventually reached parity between the 2. At least, that’s true as far as my online ranking is concerned. I’m still far more comfortable using May in bracket, and am much better at putting together loose spaghetti combos with May than I am with Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Dizzy is far more fun to play now than she was before, which I was really surprised by. I wrote about it in length <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/09/27/revisiting-dizzy-at-the-end-of-strive-season-4/">here</a>, but the short version is that Dizzy has more situations where she can score a knockdown which increases her consistency. This is a stark contrast to when Dizzy first launched, and stray hits wouldn’t result in any follow through unless you had Ice Field active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I won’t profess to be an expert, I have had a lot of fun using Dizzy’s different tools to completely lock down my opponents. Nothing feels quite like keeping someone jailed at the far end of the screen while they helplessly flail around. Doubly so because smothering someone to death is non-trivial thanks to the bevy of movement options that exist. I guess Totsu was right all those months ago when he told me that I’d probably enjoy playing a zoner in <em>Strive</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I think the biggest takeaway here is that I’ve been enjoying the process of learning again. Fighting games, specifically <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, were starting to feel really stagnant for me over the past few months. Returning to <em>Strive</em>, and focusing (mostly) on a new character have helped to really reignite my passion for the genre. I think there might be something to that, but I’d prefer to explore it in detail within a dedicated post, so I’ll put a pin in that for later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sudoku">Sudoku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; I’ve continued to play <em>Sudoku</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t have a whole lot to say on this front, but I’ve gotten a lot better at solving the <em>NYT</em>, and <em>LA Times’</em> boards by sticking to Schneider notation. This involves only marking out when a number can appear in 2 different cells within a box, row, or column. The main advantage here is that you don’t clutter the entire <em>Sudoku </em>board with information that can’t be acted upon, while also providing yourself with better information to fill in additional spaces whenever you place another number.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This video probably explains it better, honestly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, as someone who typically struggles to solve boards when there are too many candidates listed across several spaces, I really like Schneider notation. It makes many of these more challenging puzzles a lot more approachable than they were when I’d get buried in the weeds of numerous different candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is an unfortunate downside of Schneider notation: it forced me to learn at a pace that I didn’t find particularly accommodating. Schneider notation is heavily reliant on the <em>Sudoku </em>player’s ability to reliably spot, and infer intersections while solving the puzzle in question. As a result, I had to get a LOT better at spotting this pattern so I could actually make use of this particular solving strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, it’s cool that I can use Schneider notation as I find it far easier to solve puzzles by using it. On the other hand, I’d have appreciated a more gradual build up to this point. Instead, I feel like I immediately rushed hard mode, which added a lot of friction to the entire learning process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, <em>Sudoku </em>is still very fun, and very satisfying. I’d highly recommend checking it out, especially if you’re looking for a way to give your brain a daily mental workout.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like so many other people, I was playing <em>Silksong </em>throughout September. What might surprise you is that I didn’t start playing it until the 20th, so I’ve not actually finished the game yet. I do think I’m over the halfway mark though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also going to skip actually introducing what <em>Silksong </em>is because I’m assuming everyone, and their dog already knows about this game. It was the source of many memes, and much speculative hype right up until it came out. This was swiftly followed by people complaining about the game being too hard, which I can&#8217;t comment on because I started playing it after the first difficulty nerf patch went live.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, <em>Silksong </em>is a game of high peaks, and low valleys for me. The areas where it meaningfully improves upon its predecessor make <em>Silksong </em>among one of my favourite games to bless the Metroidvania subgenre. However, there are a few aspects of <em>Silksong </em>that I actively question because they repeatedly interrupt the flow of exploration, and largely contribute to it feeling like a less well put together package than its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I kind of want to cover off exactly what I mean by all of that in a longer post, but I’m afraid I’ll get lost in the weeds while writing so here’s the Cliff’s notes version:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>The music by Chris Larkin is fantastic</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The wider variety of environments, and greater use of colour are a welcome change</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hornet’s movement abilities feel fantastic to use, and help to immediately distinguish her from the previous title’s hero</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enemy and boss designs (both visual, and mechanical) are great</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The newly added Crest system provides a much needed revamp to the Badge system of the previous title</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Side quests actively detract from the game, and feel like unnecessary padding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The propensity for <em>Silksong </em>to lock players into combat arenas with a deluge of common enemies is boring, predictable, and also feels like unnecessary padding</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, I’ve been having a lot of fun exploring every corner of the game, but I can’t shake the feeling that <em>Silksong </em>is collapsing under its own weight. It feels a lot more overtly video game-y, and bloated in the way that open world games do thanks to the inclusion of really nebulous side quests, and combat arenas. When I’m able to quietly explore, and untangle its labyrinthine maze of a world, I’m at my happiest. However, <em>Silksong </em>seems hellbent on ensuring that those moments are few and far between thanks to an endless deluge of unnecessary interruptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully that explains what I meant by high peaks, and low valleys.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I decided that I wanted something less action-y to play in my evenings so I started up <em>Strange Horticulture</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I say that, but I also wanted to see if I even enjoyed the game. The reason being is Mir wanted to play the sequel, <em>Strange Antiquities</em>, alongside me instead of playing it alone like she did with the first game. As such, I’ve been working my way through <em>Strange Horticulture</em> the past few evenings, so I could give an informed yay or nay to that request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who were as blissfully unaware of this game as I was, <em>Strange Horticulture</em> is a game where you run a shop by the same name, which sells strange plants. Unfortunately, none of the plants are actually labelled, so it’s your job to research, and deduce which plants are which. Ergo, this is a bit of a Detective game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, most of the puzzles haven’t been that involved, and it doesn’t seem like that’ll change either. Instead, the occult story that’s been brewing in the background is starting to take hold, so that appears like it’ll be the focus of the back half of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little disappointed by the lack of puzzles, but I am keen to see where the story goes. Hopefully <em>Strange Horticulture</em> can wrap things up in a satisfying sort of way before I completely check out due to the lack of puzzle variety, and challenge though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for whether I’ll play the sequel with my wife, I guess you’ll have to tune in next month to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, I think we’ll call it for September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, as always, for reading if you made it this far, and stay safe out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

The announcement and release of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/07/23/every-card-is-a-puzzle-in-monster-train-2/">Monster Train 2</a></em> was totally unexpected, <em>Silksong </em>&amp; <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/06/19/surface-runs-add-a-fresh-new-twist-to-hades-2/">Hades 2</a></em> both shadow dropped this month, and <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/"><em>Strive </em>received a proper ranked mode</a> 4 years after its initial release. There were also games like <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/09/02/month-in-review-duck-detective-peak-grounded-2-more/#ooo">Öoo</a></em>, <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/29/tactical-space-invaders-starvaders-review/">StarVaders</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/07/genius-deduction-the-roottrees-are-dead-review/">The Roottrees are Dead</a></em> which totally blew me away despite the limited fanfare they received in the lead up to their respective launch dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, 2025 doesn’t appear to be slowing down with the surprises because a demo for <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> dropped 2 weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who aren’t already aware, this is the next project from <em>Radical Fish Games</em>, the creators of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2018/11/21/crosscode-review/">CrossCode</a></em>. Yes &#8211; that <em>CrossCode</em>. The same <em>CrossCode </em>with gorgeous pixel art, fantastic puzzle-filled dungeons, and one of the most heartfelt narratives that I’ve ever experienced in a video game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say that I’m a little excited about <em>Radical Fish Games’</em> next project would be an understatement. Learning about, and subsequently playing the demo for <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> was akin to my experience with <em>Monster Train 2</em> earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, said demo has fanned the flames of my excitement, and now I’m very much looking forward to the <em>Early Access</em> release of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>, which is (currently) slated for the first half of 2026.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself (again).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome back to another <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/tag/demo-dive/">Demo Dive</a></em> where today we’ll be taking a look at <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>, <em>Radical Fish Games’</em> follow-up to <em>CrossCode</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, let’s start by answering the question: what is <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to <em>CrossCode</em>, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> is an Action RPG with many of the trappings of RPGs from the 16-bit era. That is to say it has the simple, but satisfying combat of something like <em>Diablo</em>, but the narrative structure and cadence of something like <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, or <em>Earthbound</em>. It’s a blending that works quite well for someone like myself who has little patience for simple turn-based combat, but otherwise doesn’t mind the winding narrative structure typical in this sort of RPG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I appreciated some of the changes that <em>Radical Fish</em> has made when compared to their previous work namely as it relates to combat. If memory serves, <em>CrossCode </em>was very button mashy in the combat department with a simple 3 hit combo, alongside a handful of special moves. By comparison, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> features a few more combo types, which players can access by inputting their attacks with a slightly different rhythm. It’s akin to how many other 2D action games have implemented their combo systems, and it makes a welcome appearance here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> features several weapon types which each have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, the sword is fast, but deals less damage than the bulky hammer making it ideal for players who want to attack more aggressively. However, the sword only deals slicing damage, which makes it totally ineffective against enemies with tough shells. That’s where the hammer will come in handy. As such, players need to adjust their approach in combat to account for the different weaknesses of what they’re fighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a really big fan of this addition as it makes combat just that little bit more involved. It’s not so overbearing as to become the focus of the game, but it does lend itself to making fights feel like an active component of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> instead of the thing you do to fill time in between everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from combat, the other aspects that <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo was keen to showcase are the return of Zelda-esque dungeons, and the narrative hook for the story. Unfortunately, you’re only allowed to explore the first dungeon up to the point where you unlock the dungeon’s key item, meaning that the majority of the interesting puzzles, and combat encounters are locked beyond the confines of the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I wouldn’t be upset about being cut off were I not having fun. What’s on offer was really enjoyable even if it was limited in scope. Besides, <em>CrossCode </em>has some of the best constructed puzzle dungeons that I’ve ever played through, so I have every confidence that <em>Radical Fish</em> will deliver in full force with this area of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final bit that I wanted to touch on with regard to <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo is the story. I won’t be speaking about the specifics &#8211; the demo is around 2 hours long, so you can play it yourself if you’re curious. Instead, I wanted to focus on how <em>Radical Fish</em> smartly uses hooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The demo begins with a brief introduction that speaks of a world ending apocalypse (named Nyx), which is swiftly followed by a tutorial section wherein you play as some of the chosen heroes meant to repel said apocalypse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things don’t quite work out though, so everything is a little out of sorts once players take control of <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> protagonist Juno.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then learn that Juno was meant to be travelling with the group of heroes we saw during the tutorial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my money, this setup was perfect. It immediately introduced the game world, set up 2 different sources of conflict, and left me with questions that I’m interested in pursuing the answers to. For example, why wasn’t Juno with the party of chosen heroes? That immediately introduces some intrigue, while also setting up a source of conflict to build the story around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might sound like I’m praising <em>Radical Fish</em> for doing the bare minimum, but you’d be surprised just how many games get this wrong. Basically any author worth their salt knows this sort of introduction is an easy way to draw the reader into your story. It gives them something to latch onto so they can cruise through the remaining character introductions throughout the opening act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, writing is rarely the focal point for many games. As such, games are usually a lot more reliant on visual set pieces, or mechanical complexity for drawing players in. It’s for this reason that I found <em>Radical Fish’s</em> use of narrative hooks so refreshing. Doubly so since it communicated to me that they’re looking to make the story of <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> as much of a focal point as it was in <em>CrossCode</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, I’m typically a much more mechanically minded player &#8211; I think even a cursory glance at my other written work will reveal as much &#8211; so <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> getting its narrative hooks into me has gotta count for something, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I close out here, there are 2 other things that I wanted to (briefly) mention: the artwork, and music. I already thought <em>Radical Fish’s</em> previous work looked great, but the pixel art, and character animation are even more well done here. It’s almost unbelievable how good the game looks. Kudos to the art team!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along those same lines, I thought all of the music within <em>Alabaster Dawn’s</em> demo was great. Every track fit the accompanying locale, cutscene, or set piece to a tee which did a lot of heavy lifting for setting the appropriate tone throughout the demo. Again, big kudos to the folks responsible for the music as you absolutely nailed the assignment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that I think I’ve covered everything that I wanted to say about <em>Alabaster Dawn</em>. Obviously, I’m coming at it from the lens of someone who both played, and really enjoyed <em>CrossCode</em>, which might not be true for all of you. I feel like the demo showed that <em>Radical Fish</em> are doubling down on what made <em>CrossCode </em>so great, and I’m very eager to get my hands on the full release whenever they finish cooking it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I’ll have to wait a fair bit as <em>Alabaster Dawn</em> is planned for an <em>Early Access</em> launch in the first half of 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, if you’d like to check out the demo for yourself &#8211; and I think you should as it’s fantastic &#8211; then you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3110760/Alabaster_Dawn/">here via <em>Steam</em></a>. Also, don’t forget to wishlist the game if you enjoy the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

My general takeaways were mostly negative even though I found her really fun to play. There were a lot of small reasons for that, but the biggest unifying theme of my complaints was that her design felt muddled. Her tools seemed built with zoning in mind, but she was fairly mediocre at keep-out. She wasn’t much better at traditional strike-throw offense either, which left Dizzy in this weird limbo state where she couldn’t do anything particularly well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t the only person who came to this conclusion about Dizzy either. Over the next several weeks, countless tier lists were published by different notable players, and every single one of them put Dizzy in the bottom tier. Heck, some even said she was the worst character in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this isn’t the first time that people have claimed a newly released character was the worst in <em>Strive</em>, so it’s important to take such claims with a grain of salt. Infamously, some said that Happy Chaos was trash when he was first released. In the following months, Happy Chaos crept to the top of most player’s tier lists, and also won <em>EVO </em>2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, in fairness, that <em>EVO </em>win came after Happy Chaos received totally unnecessary buffs to the majority of his attacking moves. This was done as a way to compensate for a nerf to the character’s zoning capabilities, but many considered this change a massive net positive for the Happy Chaos playerbase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the point remains that many people had grossly underestimated the strength of Happy Chaos upon his initial release. As such, it wasn’t unreasonable to think that myself, and others might have missed the mark with Dizzy too. Perhaps there was something we’d missed that would unlock the true potential of the character.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as weeks turned into months, people continued to nod their head in agreement about Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, this was extremely vindicating. I don’t always have the most confidence in my opinions as it relates to Fighting games, so it was nice to see a bunch of other players (at various levels of play) all coming to the same conclusion that I did with my initial assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this also kind of sucked because I really enjoyed playing Dizzy (when she worked). That sort of sentiment shouldn’t ever stop you from playing a character that you enjoy, but it’s hard to maintain a consistent level of enthusiasm when you’re reminded how much easier it’d be to just play somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there were 2 major balance patches to <em>Strive </em>between when I last played Dizzy and now. Surely, <em>Arc System Works</em> buffed her to a point where she can actually compete, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>…Right?</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Guilty Gear Strives version 1.43 patch notes for Dizzy where she was nerfed just as much as she was buffed." class="wp-image-9603" height="508" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dizzy-patch-notes-v-143.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Guys?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All joking aside, here’s the list of (relevant) changes that Dizzy received across those 2 patches:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>For Roasting Chestnuts (236K)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>First hit no longer counts as a projectile &amp; hitbox size increased</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Causes a knockdown on hit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can now neutralize other projectiles</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Far Slash (f.S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Increased hitbox</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crouching Slash (2S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Increased hitbox</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Michael Sword (214S)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Causes a knockdown on hit</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I Used This to Catch Fish (236S|H)\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>More than doubled the active frames of the attack</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frozen State\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>No longer (erroneously) triggers a wall break</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a change that buffed the power of Yellow Roman Cancel, and damage was nerfed across the board. Both of these changes were huge for Dizzy since it increased her defensive utility, and brought her damage output inline with the rest of the cast. In fact, you could reasonably argue that Dizzy was one of the biggest beneficiaries of both changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, after a few more weeks of playing Dizzy, what do I think of her now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a short video that I believe accurately captures my impressions:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This character is a lot better at zoning now. Her tools actually compliment one another thanks to the additional knockdown opportunities afforded by both versions of Michael Sword, and Chestnut. In all cases, Dizzy has the option to set up additional projectiles, Wings of Light, or Ice Field which allows her to run her gameplan a lot more consistently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, she has stronger tools (namely For Roasting Chestnuts) for challenging the other cast members when she gets into a zoning war. This means that she doesn’t feel completely defenseless like she used to when she had to rely solely on I Used This to Catch Fish, which was too slow to meaningfully challenge most of the cast with any degree of consistency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the massive buff to I Used This to Catch Fish is certainly the highlight of the current patch, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find the changes to Chestnut from the previous patch to be more impactful. It’s actually wild how much mileage I can get out of this special attack now. It helps to keep folks locked down, and the added knockdown makes it very easy to consistently place Ice Field. This is notable as the added icy terrain makes it much harder for opponents to approach Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I can’t overlook the changes to I Used This to Catch Fish. The almost <em>40 frames</em> that this attack is active for is insane. I’ve caught so many people off guard with this attack because it’s active for so long. I think it sits firmly in gimmick territory, but I’d be lying if I said that it wasn’t an effective gimmick. And that makes it a nice option to exercise, especially against players who’re unfamiliar with Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also loving the hitbox changes on Dizzy’s Slash normals. The extended hitbox on Far Slash has led to several instances where I’ve had it clash with an opponent’s reversal (invulnerable get-off me attacks like Shoryuken), which led to an advantageous follow-up for me. This is the sort of power I was used to wielding while playing May, and having it now on Dizzy has made her feel a lot better overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Crouching Slash is basically just May’s Crouching Slash from before it was nerfed to be 10% slower. That attack was best-in-class prior to the nerf, so Dizzy having an equally strong attack here feels so good. Plus, Crouching Slash was (it still is, honestly) my favourite way to control space with May, and it works just as well on Dizzy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All said, I think Dizzy is in a much better place now than she was when she first released. She feels like a solid middle of the pack character, with well defined strengths to accompany her many weaknesses. She has a very strong presence from everywhere on the screen, and can easily suffocate her opponent after she builds up some momentum. That said, all of her attacks have exploitable dead zones, and she still struggles to cover the space above her head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I’ve continued to have a ton of fun playing Dizzy. More so than before I’d wager. I wasn’t expecting much given how few changes she’s received over the past year, but it seems like those changes targeted the areas where Dizzy needed the most help. Now she feels like a strong zoner with unique tools, instead of direction-less generalist with meagre damage output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also felt comfortable enough to use Dizzy last week in bracket at locals, and I won all 5 games where I played her. Granted, I was still playing May for the majority of my games, but it was nice to finally show off the work I’ve been putting in with Dizzy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s hoping that I continue to have fun as I progress even further with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

I have a really hard time empathizing with how tricky someone else will find different types of puzzles. That can make it hard to communicate exactly why a particular Puzzle game did or did not work for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as an example, my friends Charlie and Thomas are both very logical thinkers, and can juggle a bunch of abstract information in their minds. As a result, they find a lot of Puzzle games far too simple. There’ve been very few instances over the years where I’ve recommended a Puzzle game to either of them, and had them come back saying they actually enjoyed it. Instead, I usually get hit with, “It was neat, but a little too simple.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So…you know…that doesn’t exactly make me very confident in my abilities to recommend Puzzle games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I finished a demo for <em>The Art of Reflection</em> earlier this week, and I had to talk about it. Mostly because it is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, I’ll start Demo Dive with a brief overview of <em>The Art of Reflection</em>, though I think the attached trailer does a fairly good job of showcasing what the game is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Art of Reflection</em> is a First-Person Puzzle game with realistically simulated mirrors. Also, you can enter the mirrors. This is the foundation from which <em>The Art of Reflection</em> builds all of its puzzles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a quick example of exactly what that entails, 1 of the first puzzles that players are asked to solve in the demo involves a locked door, and a key. Unfortunately, the door requires a mirrored version of the key that you’re provided with. Luckily, you can pop through a mirror, grab a mirrored version of the key, and return to the original door which you’ll now be able to open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s notes: I only realized after the fact that this is the first puzzle in the trailer, and now feel like a doofus for using it as an example. Still &#8211; you get the idea!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a fairly basic puzzle, but that should give you an idea of what <em>The Art of Reflection</em> has going on. It’s puzzles built around reflection, and perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, I was a little dubious about how much mileage the developers <a href="https://x.com/hydrozoagames">Hydrozoa</a> could get out of that idea, but the demo did a lot to assuage my concerns. Every new room I entered either presented a completely new idea, or meaningfully built upon a previous puzzle. That gave the whole demo a great sense of momentum, and also made the whole thing very satisfying to unravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I do have to call out my favourite moment from the demo, so skip this paragraph if you don’t want to be spoiled. The first time I entered a mirror on the ceiling, and inverted gravity was so cool. I was not expecting that at all, but playing around with gravity by flipping the entire world upside down was a really neat twist on the game’s core mechanics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also got the sense that I missed a few different puzzles throughout the demo. There were these collectible pillars that you were awarded for completing several consecutive rooms. Each one seemed to increase the amount of music playing for all of the levels attached to a particular hub. I figured that the demo didn’t contain all of the levels, specifically so the developers could showcase the breadth of ideas that they had, but the message at the end of the demo makes me think that I just missed several puzzles that were hidden off the beaten path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that’s the case, that’s also really neat. I’m always a fan of Puzzle games hiding additional puzzles behind these sorts of challenges. It’s a bit of a twist on simply solving a level to unlock the next since you need to work out exactly where the hidden thing is in the first place. That’s a commitment to puzzle solving that I can appreciate in a Puzzle game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you miss those hidden levels, it’s not really a big deal? Most Puzzle games are satisfying to solve irrespective of whether or not you completed all of their most tricky conundrums. Hell, most players won’t even notice that they’ve missed anything unless you tell them. My experience is proof positive of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, I think <em>The Art of Reflection</em> looks very promising. The demo has certainly wet my appetite for the full game, which releases on November 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to try <em>The Art of Reflection</em> for yourself, there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2290770/The_Art_of_Reflection/">demo currently available on Steam</a>. And don’t forget to wishlist the game if you enjoyed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

I don’t know exactly what happened, but Mir’s machine died on Sunday, so fixing that became my sole focus for the day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After testing most of the components individually, I narrowed the problem down to the board, CPU, or PSU. Admittedly, I was too lazy to test the 3 of them because the PSU was out of warranty (so it was due for a replacement anyway), and you’re saddled with replacing the board and CPU simultaneously. So we set off to the local parts store thinking we needed to pick up 3 things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I forgot that we’d need a new AIO watercooler that fits an AM5 socket CPU. Also, the new boards aren’t compatible with DDR4 memory, so we were forced to upgrade that too. And Mir’s case was too small for all the new fixtures, so we rectified that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, after 9 hours of work (testing the parts, buying and delivering the new parts, deconstructing the old machine, and building the new machine) I finally had a shiny new PC built for wifey. Thankfully, it worked with very few hiccups, though it did need to have network adapters installed for a wired connection, which I thought was odd. She’s happy though, which is all that matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Mir thought it was a little unfair that she got to upgrade her machine when mine was older, so she also bought me some new parts. For context, I’ve been using a first gen Ryzen (1600X) for basically the entire lifetime of my blog. Very high-end back when I bought it in 2017, but it’s been completely obliterated by the passage of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was my Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, enough of how I was playing computer surgeon for the past 2 days &#8211; here are the highlights for August:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#duck-detective">Duck Detective 1 &amp; 2</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#grounded-2">Grounded 2</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#peak">PEAK</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#sudoku">Sudoku</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/feed/#ooo">Öoo</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="duck-detective">Duck Detective 1 &amp; 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As is true for an ever growing number of the titles I’ve written about, I first played <em>Duck Detective</em> during a <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/03/01/steam-next-fest-february-2025-indie-round-up-part-3/">Steam Next Fest</a></em>. The demo was short, but it showed enough of <em>Duck Detective</em> (for both the first, and second game) to convince me that there was something here that I’d enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As luck would have it, that demo didn’t lead me astray, and I had an excellent time playing through both <em>Duck Detective</em> games back-to-back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I didn’t play both games in a single sitting. I played them across 2 days, but I finished either game on the same day that I started it. That should give you a good idea of how much of a time commitment <em>Duck Detective</em> is. They’re the perfect sort of game for a lazy weekend afternoon, or after a mind-numbing day at the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as the games are concerned, both make a great case for blending detective work with elements of comedy. I figured <em>Duck Detective</em> would go more the route of <em>Frog Detective</em>, where the charm and humour are the focus, but both cases required a bit of deductive reasoning to work out. It wasn’t on the same level as something like <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/04/07/genius-deduction-the-roottrees-are-dead-review/">The Roottrees are Dead</a></em>, but I don’t think it had to be. <em>Duck Detective</em> felt like a Goldilocks level of deduction difficulty, and I appreciated that about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t just the sleuthing that made <em>Duck Detective</em> so good though: the humour also worked well. There’s a few different ways that this manifests, but my favourite was the Duck Detective himself. Sean Chiplock voices the titular detective, and gives a performance akin to a Film Noir detective who smokes a pack a day. Meanwhile, the entire game is colourful, cartoonish, and bubbly. That contrast leads to a ton of smirk worthy moments, and a few laugh-out-loud jokes throughout both games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All said, both <em>Duck Detective</em> games get a thumbs up from me. They’re great bite-sized Detective games, and I’m very much looking forward to the third installment that I assume is coming thanks to the cliffhanger ending of the second game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously. I need to know what happens next!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="grounded-2">Grounded 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/18/is-it-wrong-to-support-grounded-2-in-early-access/">Grounded 2</a></em> is the first of 2 different games that I picked up in August specifically to play with my wife. She really enjoys her Survival games, and I like doing things that make her happy. Plus, I enjoyed <em>Grounded </em>well enough, so diving into the sequel wasn’t something I was particularly opposed to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, I think the sequel is shaping up to be better than the first, but it’s obviously fairly bare-bones at the time of writing. There’s a lot of features from the first game that are missing, but planned for the sequel. That led to a number of times where the 2 of us were wondering if we’d missed something we knew existed in the original, or if it wasn’t present in the current <em>Early Access</em> build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To compensate for this, a much greater emphasis has been placed on the newly added Buggys, which are just <em>Grounded’s </em>version of mounts. Though if I’m being perfectly honest, mounts were a really good feature to launch with and build the second game around. We were basically inseparable from Sir Reginald the Domesticated (mine), and Mr Pinchy (Mir’s) once we obtained them. They make travelling so much more convenient, and their ability to carry large volumes of crafting materials was also a huge plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, the addition of mounts made me a lot less inclined to build satellite bases throughout the game world. When you can move <em>that</em> fast, you don’t really need respawn points (or emergency supplies) scattered across the map. I’m of the opinion that this somewhat undermines the survival aspects of <em>Grounded 2</em>, but it does strip out some of the tedium of creating and stocking satellite bases. As such, I don’t want to harp on about it too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also of the opinion that lowering the difficulty, at least during the first few nights, was a net positive. As veteran players, we were a little surprised by the lack of hostility, but it was easy to see how it started ramping up as we explored more of the available space, and started challenging (and defeating) stronger enemies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that, I don’t have terribly strong opinions about the rest of the changes from the first game. Most of it was either a “that’s neat”, or “I preferred this in the first game”. In either case, I wasn’t moved to the point where I feel like sharing a detailed breakdown of my nitpicks here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as recommendations go, I’d say wait for the game to receive some more updates. I think the few new additions show that <em>Eidos Montreal</em> has a good grasp on what they’re doing with <em>Grounded 2</em>, but I think the experience of actually playing through the game will be better after they’ve had more time to develop it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="peak">PEAK</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second of those 2 aforementioned games that I picked up to play with Mir. Though I’ll be perfectly honest here: I had no interest in playing <em>PEAK</em>. I know that it’s taken the whole world by storm, but I just…it didn’t look like something I’d enjoy playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those not in the know, <em>PEAK </em>is a game where you play as plane crash survivors, and need to ascend a mountain to signal for a rescue. You go through 4 different biomes, which make no logical sense, but it does provide different gameplay challenges that make the journey fairly interesting. For example, the second area, a jungle, rains constantly which makes it significantly harder to climb up the sheer cliff faces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, one night at dinner, Mir was lamenting how she was frustrated that she could never reach the eponymous peak with her regular cluster of friends. Luckily, <em>PEAK </em>was on sale that very same day, so I bought it, and said I’d help her to reach the top of the mountain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am happy to report that I have a 50% winrate at <em>PEAK</em>, and I made my wife very happy when we reached the top of the mountain during our second run playing together. I then promptly uninstalled the game because I was 100% right in my original assessment: <em>PEAK </em>is not for me. Though it was nice to help my wife, especially as I got to hear her bragging about it (over a <em>Discord </em>call) the next day with her friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hooooo boy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, <em>Is This Seat Taken</em> was another title I covered from <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/02/26/steam-next-fest-february-2025-indie-round-up-part-1/">Next Fest</a></em>, and it was one of my favourites from the particular event that it debuted at. I was really impressed with the variety of ways that developer <em>Poti Poti Games</em> managed to utilize the core mechanic of placing shapes around a level based on their seating preferences. Doubly so because of how some of your decisions would have cascading effects on future problems within the level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, there is a level in a film festival where certain movie-goers have popcorn. They’ll leave a bit of a mess behind in their seats though, which will interfere with your ability to place shapes who don’t like messy seats leading to some interesting cross-puzzle problem solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the full game doesn’t evolve much beyond the confines of what’s shown off within the demo. This was a fairly large disappointment if I’m being perfectly honest. There is so much variety in those first few levels, but you end up revisiting a lot of the same locations over, and over throughout <em>Is This Seat Taken</em> with the only real differences being that a few additional seating preferences have been added to the mix. This gives the whole game a rather flat difficulty curve, and makes it feel quite repetitive by the time credits roll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have similar opinions about the game’s story. Conceptually, I like it. Having a story about finding your place in the world gels really nicely with a game that’s literally about finding the best place for everyone to sit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the story moves at a really languid pace, and feels far too stretched out to be satisfying. I appreciated what was there, but I think the delivery would benefit from a tighter script, and delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, and it pains me to say this, I don’t know that I’d recommend <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> If it was a little tighter than I probably would, but it’s a little too drawn out for my taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sudoku">Sudoku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t originally going to include this, but I spent more time playing <em>Sudoku </em>this past month than I spent playing…anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I already wrote a whole article about it, but I’ve since progressed well beyond the point where I was while writing. I’ve completed the Hard puzzle on <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku">NYT</a> </em>for the past 2 weeks, and have done the past 14 Expert, and Impossible difficulty <em>Sudokus </em>over on <em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/games/sudoku">LA Times</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my money, the coolest part of this whole thing has been learning different solving proofs. What I mean by that is that there are certain patterns that you can apply to reduce the number of potential candidates for a specific space on the board beyond the standard <em>Sudoku </em>rules. I already touched on that a bit in my article, but I’ve had to learn several additional proofs while solving these harder puzzles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most satisfying part of this whole journey has been actually applying those proofs on future puzzles though. It’s almost like learning a new combo in a fighting game, or a new card combo in a deck-builder that improves your odds of success. Though, I’ll fully admit that I don’t always understand the internal logic for all of the proofs that I use, but I know that they work, and I can visually identify them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, I’m glad that I started doing <em>Sudoku </em>puzzles daily because they’re really satisfying to solve in a way that very few other things in my day-to-day life are. It kind of reminds me of programming if I’m being honest. Though without all the bullshit that regularly made my old office job brain-rotting instead of fulfilling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ooo">Öoo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming from the developer of <em>Elechead</em>, Nama Takahashi, <em>Öoo </em>is another great puzzle game where Takahashi takes a single idea, and runs with it to the ends of the Earth. In this case, you play as a caterpillar adjacent creature, and you place bombs that you can explode at will. The result is an incredibly satisfying puzzle-platformer that’s filled to the brim with excellent puzzles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the moment where <em>Öoo </em>went from good to great, for me, was when I hit my first dead-end. The game’s structured like a Metroidvania, so reaching that final empty room felt really anticlimactic. Everything about the game’s design language was saying that there should have been a reward here &#8211; like a new power-up &#8211; for all my effort in reaching this room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s when it hit me: I already got the power-up. In order to even reach the room in question, I had to first learn a new way to use my bombs. Then there were several consecutive rooms with puzzles built around reaffirming my understanding of this new technique. That was the reward: new knowledge that I didn’t previously possess.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-youtube"></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That dead-end after a series of puzzles wasn’t a 1 off occurrence either: it happened another 7 times. There’s a term that I’ve heard used to describe games like this &#8211; Metroid-brainias &#8211; and <em>Öoo </em>fits squarely within that niche. All of your different “power-ups” are knowledge based, which makes them really satisfying to discover, and apply throughout the game’s world. I’m a sucker for this sort of thing, so I had a really great time working my way through each level of <em>Öoo</em>, while learning everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, I love how Takahashi wordlessly teaches all of these concepts to the player. I feel like teaching through level design has become a bit of a lost art, so seeing that on full display throughout <em>Öoo </em>was really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, <em>Öoo </em>comes highly recommended. It’s about 2 hours for a standard playthrough, and it’ll make you feel very satisfied as you work through its various quandaries. Though, I think it is limited to a <em>Steam </em>release at the moment, but I’d hazard a guess that it’ll make its way to <em>Switch </em>at some point like <em>Elechead </em>did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, I think I’ll call it for August. I was going to write a section about <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> as well, but I think the article I wrote last week <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2025/08/26/they-finally-fixed-ranked-matches-in-guilty-gear-strive/">gushing about the newly added Ranked Match mode</a> says it all. It’s great. It’s the best <em>Strive </em>I’ve played in a very long time. I’m happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, I don’t know exactly what I’ll be covering throughout September. There’s a few revisions I’m making to my <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/01/19/guilty-gear-strive-may-guide-for-beginner-combos/">May guide</a> in tandem with the newly dropped seasonal updates for <em>Strive</em>, but that’ll be imperceptible to most of my readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess just keep checking back here periodically, or consider subscribing for email notifications. That’ll let you know whenever a new post goes live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you as always for reading, and I’ll see you in the next one.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy what you read?

The game just turned 4 in June, so I assumed we’d be stuck with the Duel Tower forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the recently released <a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2559/">version 1.48</a> of <em><a href="https://frostilyte.ca/tag/guilty-gear-strive/">Guilty Gear Strive</a></em>, a new and improved ranked system was rolled out alongside the <em>Cyberpunk Edgerunner’s</em> collaboration character Lucy. While Lucy is certainly the main draw of the new patch, the addition of Ranked Match is what coaxed me into actually reinstalling <em>Strive</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve gone <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2022/08/07/i-wish-guilty-gear-strives-ranked-play-was-better/">on record</a>, <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/05/07/im-sick-and-tired-of-guilty-gear-strives-broken-online/">twice now</a>, as being deeply disappointed in, and regularly frustrated by <em>Guilty Gear Strive’s</em> former ranked system: Duel Tower. Some of my issues have been addressed over the game’s lifetime, such as the addition of pre-match connection quality indicators, but the Tower still leaves a lot to be desired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my money, the single biggest problem with the Tower is that there is no nuance to its ranking system. There are 11 total floors, which act like 11 distinct rankings. The game takes a guess at which floor it thinks you’ll be best suited for, and then moves you up or down depending on how well you do. So far, so standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem arises when you look at how quickly the Tower will move players up, or down a floor. It only takes 5 to 6 consecutive wins, or losses for your recommended floor to change. This is fine in situations where players are demonstrably outside of the average skill level of their peers, but that’s rarely been my experience in Tower. For example, 3 back to back losses could see you get demoted a floor even if the games were fairly close. This will then see you stomping players of a lower skill level before the tower moves you back up to the floor you were on previously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth pointing out that 11 distinct rankings is fairly low. This doesn’t leave the tower with much room for more nuanced sorting simply because it only has 11 buckets to distribute players into. This also means that if the Tower is working as intended then you’re moving between groups of almost 10% of the total player population anytime you change floors. That’s a fairly absurd jump to make unless, again, the player in question is consistently outmanoeuvring all of their opponents with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking more specifically of my own experience, Tower mostly resulted in fairly 1-sided fights. I was either far better than my opponent, or I was playing someone who I had no chance of beating. My winrate might have been sitting around ~45-50% (which would be ideal), but the quality of the matches in question were subpar. Honestly, it was akin to my experience playing in open lobbies in other fighting games. Yet there was no alternative, so everyone, myself included, was forced to use the Tower regardless of how we felt about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why I was so intrigued by the addition of Ranked Matches in version 1.48. Could this finally be an answer to all of the problems I’ve previously held with <em>Strive’s</em> asinine ranking system? Will it actually allow me to regularly play players of roughly the same aptitude, instead of that being a pleasant rarity in a sea of misery?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it would happen, yes. Yes it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the best experience I’ve ever had playing <em>Strive</em>. No hyperbole. Over its lifetime, I’ve put 1000 hours into <em>Strive</em>, and this, right now, is the most pleasant experience I’ve had playing online ranked matches. The overwhelming majority of my matches have had a good cadence, and I feel like I can identify areas of improvement from losses instead of feeling totally dumbfounded. That’s a far cry from my previous experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s probably not a secret how developer <em>Arc System Works</em> managed to achieve this: they simply copied every other ranking system that exists. Instead of 11 ranks, there are now 19, which provides the ranking system with far more nuance for how it divides up players. This allows for the game to make much more accurate assessments of relative skill, which leads to far more matches where either player has a reasonable shot.</p>\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-image">\n<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Guilty Gear Strive\'s newly added ranks as part of the version 1.48 update." class="wp-image-9495" height="382" src="https://frostilyte.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ranked.png?w=616" width="616" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Plus, it takes somewhere in the neighbourhood of 25 consecutive wins to move up to the next rank, so moving up or down no longer feels like doing the <em>Cha Cha Slide</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just how the matches have felt that has made playing Ranked Match so pleasant though: it’s also reduced the time I spend in menus. I had to spend so much time finding, and connecting to stations while playing in Tower. This was only exacerbated if there were connection issues, which there frequently were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the new Ranked Match system, I simply choose my preferred matchmaking settings, which are saved between sessions, and press start. Then I wait until the game finds me a match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can not overstate how much better this feels to actually use. I can simply focus on playing the game, and making notes between sets instead of fighting with the game to get into my next match. I don’t even know if connection problems are as rampant as they were after the crossplay update because I’m not responsible for dealing with them anymore. All that shit is hidden, so I can focus on actually playing the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s glorious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Arc System Works</em> also addressed the complaints about how Tower used a unified rank for your entire account, and implemented rank on a per character basis. This just adds to the friction-less experience of using the new ranked mode, and is yet another reason why I’m very happy that it was finally implemented. I can now actually swap between <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2024/11/20/the-return-of-the-queen-queen-dizzy-first-impressions/">Dizzy</a>, and <a href="https://frostilyte.ca/2023/01/19/guilty-gear-strive-may-guide-for-beginner-combos/">May</a>, whom I have vastly different levels of skill playing, without needing to ruin the experience for other players while <em>Strive </em>struggled to figure out which floor I ought to be on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was a little skeptical at first, but I’ve gotta give it up: this new ranking system is awesome. And that’s not to say that it does anything unique from other ranking systems. Quite the contrary. It’s just a normal ranking system, with very little menuing required from players between matches. I love how I can just press a button and boom &#8211; it’s <em>Guilty Gear</em> time. That is refreshingly straightforward, and has made my recent time playing <em>Strive </em>an absolute joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about you?

From meticulously planning road layouts in Cities: Skylines to managing survival in Frostpunk, I love the challenge of building something from the ground up.&nbsp;<p></p><p>But <a href="https://www.polymorph.games/en/" target="_blank">Polymorph Game</a>\'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/690830/Foundation/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> feels different.</p><p>After finally diving in over the weekend—despite having picked it up in Early Access in 2023—I found myself completely losing track of time. Somehow, four hours vanished out of thin air. The way villages grow organically, without a rigid grid, gives the game a unique feel, and balancing resources and villager needs is incredibly rewarding. Add in its gorgeous visuals, and I can already tell this is a city-builder I’ll be spending a lot more time with.</p><p>Of course, learning a new game like Foundation can be a challenge, and that’s where great content creators make all the difference. I’ve followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CityPlannerPlays" target="_blank">City Planner Plays</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://@cityplannerplays.bsky.social">@cityplannerplays.bsky.social</a>) for years—first for his Cities: Skylines content and later for his deep-dive How-To guides in other games. His approach is what makes him stand out: clear, structured instructions, useful background context, and a willingness to show his own mistakes when they serve as valuable lessons.</p><p>This post is as much a learning tool for myself as it is a guide for anyone new to the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, I’ve broken down City Planner Plays’ step-by-step instructions for starting a village, prioritizing buildings, and setting up a successful economy.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re diving into the game for the first time (or coming back like me), this should help you get started—and I highly recommend checking out his full video (below) for even more insights.</p><h2>How to Start Your Village in Foundation | by City Planner Plays</h2><div><h3><i>A step-by-step guide based on City Planner Plays\' gameplay.</i></h3></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><span><a name="more"></a></span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><u>1.

From meticulously planning road layouts in Cities: Skylines to managing survival in Frostpunk, I love the challenge of building something from the ground up.&nbsp;<p></p><p>But <a href="https://www.polymorph.games/en/" target="_blank">Polymorph Game</a>\'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/690830/Foundation/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> feels different.</p><p>After finally diving in over the weekend—despite having picked it up in Early Access in 2023—I found myself completely losing track of time. Somehow, four hours vanished out of thin air. The way villages grow organically, without a rigid grid, gives the game a unique feel, and balancing resources and villager needs is incredibly rewarding. Add in its gorgeous visuals, and I can already tell this is a city-builder I’ll be spending a lot more time with.</p><p>Of course, learning a new game like Foundation can be a challenge, and that’s where great content creators make all the difference. I’ve followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CityPlannerPlays" target="_blank">City Planner Plays</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://@cityplannerplays.bsky.social">@cityplannerplays.bsky.social</a>) for years—first for his Cities: Skylines content and later for his deep-dive How-To guides in other games.

While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step.

While Star Wars is a sprawling space opera and Dune is a more intricate exploration of power, politics, and destiny, both stories revolve around desert planets, mystical abilities, and intergalactic conflicts.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The similarities run so deep that it’s hard to ignore Dune’s influence on Lucas’s work.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s dive into their similarities and differences!</div><div><br /></div><span><a name="more"></a></span><div><p>At the heart of both universes lies a desert world: Arrakis in Dune and Tatooine in Star Wars. These harsh landscapes serve as crucibles where the heroes—Paul Atreides and Luke Skywalker—undergo transformative journeys. Each story also features a feudal political structure, with noble houses or planetary rulers vying for power. In Dune, the Atreides, Harkonnens, and the Padishah Emperor dominate the political landscape, while Star Wars presents the Galactic Republic, later overtaken by the Sith-led Empire. The tension between centralized control and rebellion is a core theme in both narratives.</p><p>Mysticism and prophecy play major roles as well. Paul Atreides is believed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a prophesied super-being who can see the future. Similarly, Anakin Skywalker is the "Chosen One" destined to bring balance to the Force, a mantle later inherited by his son, Luke. The Jedi and the Bene Gesserit both harness special powers—Jedi through the Force, and Bene Gesserit through their Voice, which allows them to manipulate others, much like the Jedi Mind Trick. Both sagas explore the burden of destiny and the fine line between heroism and tyranny.</p><p>Another shared element is the presence of a valuable, mystical substance. In Dune, the spice melange fuels space travel, extends life, and grants prescience, making it the most sought-after resource in the universe. In Star Wars, the Force is an omnipresent energy field that grants its users supernatural abilities and plays a crucial role in the balance of the galaxy. Both are deeply tied to religious and philosophical beliefs, shaping the destinies of entire civilizations.</p><p>Character arcs and relationships also mirror each other. Paul and Luke start as young, noble-born figures thrust into intergalactic struggles after the betrayal of their families. They both undergo rigorous training under wise mentors—Paul under Stilgar and Gurney Halleck, Luke under Obi-Wan and Yoda—before rising to lead rebellions. Villains in both stories are larger-than-life figures clad in imposing armor, from Baron Harkonnen to Darth Vader. The theme of political machinations and betrayal runs deep, with House Atreides falling due to imperial treachery, much like the Republic’s downfall at the hands of Palpatine.</p><p>Even the worlds themselves share familiar elements. Both stories feature smugglers dealing in an illegal spice trade, enormous desert-dwelling creatures—sandworms in Dune and Krayt dragons in Star Wars—and vast underworld networks controlling illicit activities. The Dune universe spans thousands of years, following Paul’s lineage, just as Star Wars expands through the generations of the Skywalker family. Both have grown into massive franchises with extended universes of books, films, and spin-offs.</p><p>However, while Dune and Star Wars share a foundation, they diverge in tone, complexity, and intended audience. Dune is a dense, intellectual work that delves into themes of politics, environmentalism, religious fanaticism, and the consequences of absolute power. Herbert weaves a story where characters are deeply flawed, power is never straightforward, and every victory comes with a hidden cost. Meanwhile, Star Wars distills many of Dune’s elements into something more streamlined, action-oriented, and accessible. It embraces the mythic structure of the hero’s journey, with clear lines drawn between good and evil. While there are moments of moral ambiguity—such as Anakin’s fall to the dark side—the story ultimately leans toward a fairy tale resolution.</p><p>This difference makes Star Wars feel like an entry-level version of Dune—not in a reductive or condescending way, but in the sense that it offers a thrilling, digestible adventure that can serve as a gateway to more complex storytelling. Star Wars is fast-paced and cinematic, appealing to younger audiences with its clear character archetypes, epic battles, and emotional simplicity. Dune, on the other hand, demands patience. It challenges the reader with intricate political maneuvering, layered characters, and a world that operates in shades of gray rather than black and white.</p><p>For many fans, Star Wars is the first step into science fiction, a story that ignites a love for galaxy-spanning adventures and mysticism. For those who find themselves drawn to its deeper themes—the philosophy of the Force, the political struggles of the Republic, the moral dilemmas of power—Dune offers a natural next step. It takes the grand, operatic elements of Star Wars and grounds them in a reality where power is brutal, where ecological concerns dictate the survival of entire civilizations, and where messiahs are as dangerous as they are revered.</p><p>While Star Wars draws inspiration from many sources, including Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films, and Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey, the imprint of Dune is undeniable. Lucas mixed multiple influences to craft his space opera, resulting in a faster-paced, action-driven narrative compared to Dune’s more introspective and politically complex storytelling.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened. That bizarre, campy mess deserves to be locked in a vault and yeeted into a black hole. A clone-Ripley with alien DNA? A Xenomorph with puppy dog eyes? No thanks. Some things are best left unacknowledged.</i>).&nbsp;</p><p>And then, decades later, Ridley Scott returned. He promised to answer those burning questions we’d had since Alien. He promised us something epic, something profound.</p><p>Instead, we got <b>Prometheus </b>and <b>Alien: Covenant</b>—films that thought they were profound, but mostly just left us shaking our heads, wondering how some of the dumbest people in the universe got sent on space missions.</p><p>Let’s talk about the prequels.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Prometheus: A Beautiful, Dumb Mystery</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/s1200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/w400-h200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p>Prometheus promised us a grand exploration of the origins of life and the Xenomorphs, wrapped in a sleek, high-concept sci-fi package. And visually? It delivered. The ship design was stunning, the interior dripping with that clean, industrial aesthetic that felt like a spiritual cousin to the Nostromo (well the crew quarters really), only way more advanced. The planetary storm sequence? Pure spectacle.&nbsp;</p><p>The Engineers?&nbsp;</p><p>Towering and mysterious—though, let’s be real, their proportions felt wonky, as if Ridley Scott couldn\'t quite decide whether they were gods or just really tall dudes in marble skin suits. <i>Do yourself a favour—go rewatch the scene where the crew of the Nostromo first stumbles upon the Space Jockey. Take a good look at the proportions. That thing is massive, ancient, and downright eerie. Now ask yourself: does an Engineer really seem big enough to fit that chair? Yeah, I didn’t think so either.</i></p><p></p><p>Performance-wise, Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron carried the film on their backs. Rapace brought intensity to her role as Elizabeth Shaw, a scientist driven by faith and curiosity, while Fassbender’s David was the perfect blend of unsettling and fascinating—an android more human than the humans around him. And Theron? Her cold, corporate badassery added a delicious layer of tension.</p><p>But for all the things "Prometheus" got right, its flaws loomed as large as the Engineer statues. The whole "our DNA comes from a space giant dissolving in a river" premise felt half-baked at best, eye-roll-inducing at worst. If the Engineers were supposed to be our creators, why was there zero effort to explain their motives? Why did they want to wipe out humanity? What was this planet even for? Instead of storytelling, we got vague hints and unanswered questions wrapped in pseudo-philosophical musings.</p><p>Then there was the crew—easily the dumbest collection of scientists and astronauts ever put on screen. Removing helmets in an alien environment? Playing "here, kitty kitty" with a clearly hostile alien snake thing? These people made the space truckers from Alien look like Nobel Prize winners. And the mutations—ugh. Fifield’s transformation into a rabid space zombie was laughably bad, and don’t even get me started on the grotesque, beige "proto-Alien" at the end. It looked like a half-melted action figure.</p><p>Oh, and that rolling Engineer ship? The fact that Vickers—who had been competent up until that moment—somehow forgot to run sideways and got pancaked was the cherry on top of this frustrating mess.</p><p>"Prometheus" was a film of incredible potential, weighed down by weak storytelling and infuriatingly dumb character decisions. It gave us glimpses of something greater but never had the courage to actually show us anything meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p>Visually breathtaking, thematically ambitious, but ultimately… a beautifully designed pile of nonsense.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Alien: Covenant: A Gore-Soaked, Half-Baked Hybrid</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/s1296/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/w400-h225/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>If <b>Prometheus </b>was Ridley Scott\'s attempt at deep, existential sci-fi, <b>Alien: Covenant</b> was his half-hearted apology to fans who just wanted some classic Xenomorph carnage. And to be fair, it sort of delivered. We got facehuggers, chestbursters, and plenty of gruesome deaths. But at what cost? The film felt like it was straddling two worlds—trying to bridge the philosophical musings of Prometheus with the horror elements of Alien—and it never really nailed either.</p><p></p><p>Let’s start with the good. Visually, Covenant was just as slick as its predecessor, with some beautifully haunting cinematography. The ship design was solid, the eerie desolation of the Engineer city was striking, and the alien-infested sequences had some intense, gory payoff. And, once again, Michael Fassbender absolutely crushed it—his dual role as the psychotic David and the more naive Walter was easily the most compelling part of the movie. The flute scene? Weird, but Fassbender made it work. "I\'ll do the fingering" may have been unintentionally hilarious, but it also cemented David as one of the most fascinatingly twisted characters in the franchise.</p><p>But then we get to the problems—and, oh boy, there are many.&nbsp;</p><p>The crew? Somehow even dumber than the ones in Prometheus. These were colonists tasked with establishing a new human home, yet they made every idiotic decision possible. Landing on an uncharted planet without hazmat suits? Poking at alien life forms again? Splitting up the team when they know there’s a hostile presence? It was like watching a slasher movie where the victims are actively trying to get themselves killed.</p><p>The Xenomorphs? They felt… off. The Neomorphs were creepy, but they never really lived up to the terror of the original creatures. And when we finally got to a full-fledged Xenomorph, the CGI just didn\'t have the same weight or presence as the practical effects from Alien and Aliens. Instead of lurking in the shadows, dripping menace, the creature just kind of… sprinted around like a hyperactive dog.</p><p>And then there was that twist. We all saw it coming a mile away—David taking Walter’s place—yet the movie played it like some grand revelation.

Enter <b>Alien: Romulus</b>, Ridley Scott’s latest attempt at resurrecting the franchise—though this time, he’s stepping back into a producer role, with <i>Fede Álvarez </i>(Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) taking the director’s chair.

A masterclass in psychological horror, it didn’t just scare the bejesus out of us—it haunted us. The Xenomorph wasn’t just a monster; it was pure, unrelenting terror, an evolutionary nightmare with acid for blood and a life cycle straight out of a Lovecraftian fever dream. And then there was the mystery—so many questions. Where did this perfect killing machine come from? Who was the Space Jockey, that eerie, fossilized giant slumped over in his derelict ship? What the hell had he been carrying, and why was he crash-landed on that barren, hostile rock?</p><p>Then came <i>James Cameron</i>, who took one look at <i>Ridley Scott</i>’s slow-burn horror masterpiece and said, <i>Hold my beer</i>. With Aliens (1986), he flipped the script, swapping dread for adrenaline. It was no longer about one crew being hunted in the shadows—it was war. Cameron turned Ellen Ripley from a survivor into an absolute badass, threw in a squad of space marines, and cranked the action up to eleven. It worked. Instead of diminishing the terror, it made the Xenomorphs even more frightening—because now there were hundreds of them, and they were organized.</p><p>Then… things got weird.</p><p>Alien 3 stumbled in like a confused drunk at a house party, unsure of what it was supposed to be. David Fincher (who, to be fair, was tormented by studio meddling) tried to recapture the original’s claustrophobic horror but ended up with a bleak, unsatisfying mess. Worse, it killed off Newt and Hicks in the first five minutes (<i>WTF!</i>)—a gut punch that felt more like a slap in the face to fans who had grown attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>But the real tragedy?&nbsp;</p><p>The what could have been.&nbsp;</p><p>William Gibson, the cyberpunk god himself, had written an early script draft that would have taken the franchise in a wildly different direction—Cold War paranoia, genetic experimentation, Weyland-Yutani versus the UPP (basically Soviet space marines), and a new breed of Xenomorphs. But nah, Fox scrapped that and gave us… a single dog-alien on a prison planet.</p><p>By this point, the Alien series had lost its sense of direction. The magic of the first two films—the mystery, the fear, the sheer brilliance—had been watered down by confused storytelling and studio interference. (<i>And no, I haven\'t forgotten about Alien Resurrection (1997)—I’m just choosing to pretend it never happened. That bizarre, campy mess deserves to be locked in a vault and yeeted into a black hole. A clone-Ripley with alien DNA? A Xenomorph with puppy dog eyes? No thanks. Some things are best left unacknowledged.</i>).&nbsp;</p><p>And then, decades later, Ridley Scott returned. He promised to answer those burning questions we’d had since Alien. He promised us something epic, something profound.</p><p>Instead, we got <b>Prometheus </b>and <b>Alien: Covenant</b>—films that thought they were profound, but mostly just left us shaking our heads, wondering how some of the dumbest people in the universe got sent on space missions.</p><p>Let’s talk about the prequels.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Prometheus: A Beautiful, Dumb Mystery</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/s1200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcV-c8c5CRZqwqctFVNoQfr2Bi8aj_05GPaj-DJK-otjb0hJCPKzmirWbnuAzWBWLR4QaYB_PFMTL-JIpENXElHenRmM0lWS1nzI7G71_15oOLDc8jxhtTd8hojmTAZqUsbCZhitw5vEHZr-OWk97QifEBthL8GiJ9zD1-YZegxUe-N29Z8OshWw/w400-h200/sMKphTbXp87SzJmNxKKTiE.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><p>Prometheus promised us a grand exploration of the origins of life and the Xenomorphs, wrapped in a sleek, high-concept sci-fi package. And visually? It delivered. The ship design was stunning, the interior dripping with that clean, industrial aesthetic that felt like a spiritual cousin to the Nostromo (well the crew quarters really), only way more advanced. The planetary storm sequence? Pure spectacle.&nbsp;</p><p>The Engineers?&nbsp;</p><p>Towering and mysterious—though, let’s be real, their proportions felt wonky, as if Ridley Scott couldn\'t quite decide whether they were gods or just really tall dudes in marble skin suits. <i>Do yourself a favour—go rewatch the scene where the crew of the Nostromo first stumbles upon the Space Jockey. Take a good look at the proportions. That thing is massive, ancient, and downright eerie. Now ask yourself: does an Engineer really seem big enough to fit that chair? Yeah, I didn’t think so either.</i></p><p></p><p>Performance-wise, Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron carried the film on their backs. Rapace brought intensity to her role as Elizabeth Shaw, a scientist driven by faith and curiosity, while Fassbender’s David was the perfect blend of unsettling and fascinating—an android more human than the humans around him. And Theron? Her cold, corporate badassery added a delicious layer of tension.</p><p>But for all the things "Prometheus" got right, its flaws loomed as large as the Engineer statues. The whole "our DNA comes from a space giant dissolving in a river" premise felt half-baked at best, eye-roll-inducing at worst. If the Engineers were supposed to be our creators, why was there zero effort to explain their motives? Why did they want to wipe out humanity? What was this planet even for? Instead of storytelling, we got vague hints and unanswered questions wrapped in pseudo-philosophical musings.</p><p>Then there was the crew—easily the dumbest collection of scientists and astronauts ever put on screen. Removing helmets in an alien environment? Playing "here, kitty kitty" with a clearly hostile alien snake thing? These people made the space truckers from Alien look like Nobel Prize winners. And the mutations—ugh. Fifield’s transformation into a rabid space zombie was laughably bad, and don’t even get me started on the grotesque, beige "proto-Alien" at the end. It looked like a half-melted action figure.</p><p>Oh, and that rolling Engineer ship? The fact that Vickers—who had been competent up until that moment—somehow forgot to run sideways and got pancaked was the cherry on top of this frustrating mess.</p><p>"Prometheus" was a film of incredible potential, weighed down by weak storytelling and infuriatingly dumb character decisions. It gave us glimpses of something greater but never had the courage to actually show us anything meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p>Visually breathtaking, thematically ambitious, but ultimately… a beautifully designed pile of nonsense.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;">Alien: Covenant: A Gore-Soaked, Half-Baked Hybrid</h2><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/s1296/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX9ld18__WN5Hn59Bl-QHz10ps9XBrDr4ucUw33oRXGxou6rw-C_PI60n-izSblBFNpQ4Ee9Fo82mpPSCSrQiETPJi-KS32Lt1bpdAvxi9YqLv_LQhu9Te3VtCz0wpa_a4IEExzLpZtU94Jy-N_6ycfsOmIZBg4V5ByWrQsbmvDSnvS4r_PslnPw/w400-h225/alien-covenant-ac_152_00459216_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>If <b>Prometheus </b>was Ridley Scott\'s attempt at deep, existential sci-fi, <b>Alien: Covenant</b> was his half-hearted apology to fans who just wanted some classic Xenomorph carnage. And to be fair, it sort of delivered. We got facehuggers, chestbursters, and plenty of gruesome deaths. But at what cost? The film felt like it was straddling two worlds—trying to bridge the philosophical musings of Prometheus with the horror elements of Alien—and it never really nailed either.</p><p></p><p>Let’s start with the good. Visually, Covenant was just as slick as its predecessor, with some beautifully haunting cinematography. The ship design was solid, the eerie desolation of the Engineer city was striking, and the alien-infested sequences had some intense, gory payoff. And, once again, Michael Fassbender absolutely crushed it—his dual role as the psychotic David and the more naive Walter was easily the most compelling part of the movie. The flute scene? Weird, but Fassbender made it work. "I\'ll do the fingering" may have been unintentionally hilarious, but it also cemented David as one of the most fascinatingly twisted characters in the franchise.</p><p>But then we get to the problems—and, oh boy, there are many.&nbsp;</p><p>The crew? Somehow even dumber than the ones in Prometheus. These were colonists tasked with establishing a new human home, yet they made every idiotic decision possible. Landing on an uncharted planet without hazmat suits? Poking at alien life forms again? Splitting up the team when they know there’s a hostile presence? It was like watching a slasher movie where the victims are actively trying to get themselves killed.</p><p>The Xenomorphs? They felt… off. The Neomorphs were creepy, but they never really lived up to the terror of the original creatures. And when we finally got to a full-fledged Xenomorph, the CGI just didn\'t have the same weight or presence as the practical effects from Alien and Aliens. Instead of lurking in the shadows, dripping menace, the creature just kind of… sprinted around like a hyperactive dog.</p><p>And then there was that twist. We all saw it coming a mile away—David taking Walter’s place—yet the movie played it like some grand revelation. The final scene, with Daniels realizing the truth as David smugly locked her into cryosleep, had so much potential to be chilling. But it was frustrating because it was just another rehash of the same “crew doomed by their own stupidity” trope we’d already seen before.</p><p><b>Alien: Covenant</b> had all the ingredients of a great sci-fi horror film, but it never fully committed to either its horror roots or its philosophical ambitions.

Notable sci-fi classics like <b>Blade Runner</b> (1982) &amp; <b>Blade Runner 2049</b> (2018), <b>The Matrix</b> (1999), and <b>Inception</b> (2010) received acclaim for their groundbreaking visuals and storytelling but were largely confined to technical awards. For instance, <b>The Matrix</b> won four Oscars, all in technical categories, without nominations for Best Picture or Best Director.&nbsp;\u200b2018\'s <b>Blade Runner 2049</b> won for Best Visual Effects and Best Cinematography, but wasn\'t even nominated for Best Picture, nor Best Director.</p><span><a name="more"></a></span><p>A significant breakthrough occurred in 2023 when <b>Everything Everywhere All at Once</b> became the first sci-fi film to win Best Picture. How this movie and not Dune Part One won the Oscar for Best Movie, is beyond me. Nevertheless, this marked a departure from the Academy\'s traditional preferences, signaling a potential shift in recognizing the genre\'s broader contributions.&nbsp;\u200b</p><p>The Dune franchise, based on Frank Herbert\'s seminal 1965 novel, has experienced a similar pattern. <b>Dune: Part One</b> (2021) garnered six Oscars, all in technical categories, including Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, but missed out on Best Picture and Best Director. <b>Dune: Part Two</b> continued this trend with its two technical wins.&nbsp;\u200b</p><p>The consistent relegation of sci-fi films to technical categories suggests a broader industry perception that views these works primarily as showcases for technological innovation rather than as vehicles for profound storytelling or artistic expression. This perspective overlooks the genre\'s capacity to explore complex themes, envision alternative realities, and challenge societal norms.\u200b</p><p>Despite these challenges, there are signs of change. The success of Everything Everywhere All at Once in major categories indicates a growing appreciation for sci-fi narratives. Then again, I\'m wondering if the "comedy" aspect of that movie, made it more appealing then the typical serious science fiction movie.

While these awards recognize the film\'s technical excellence, they also highlight the Academy\'s historical tendency to limit recognition of science fiction (sci-fi) films to technical categories, often overlooking them in major awards such as Best Picture, Best Director, and acting categories.\u200b</p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p>Historically, the <b>Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</b> has shown reluctance in honoring sci-fi films in major categories. Notable sci-fi classics like <b>Blade Runner</b> (1982) &amp; <b>Blade Runner 2049</b> (2018), <b>The Matrix</b> (1999), and <b>Inception</b> (2010) received acclaim for their groundbreaking visuals and storytelling but were largely confined to technical awards. For instance, <b>The Matrix</b> won four Oscars, all in technical categories, without nominations for Best Picture or Best Director.&nbsp;\u200b2018\'s <b>Blade Runner 2049</b> won for Best Visual Effects and Best Cinematography, but wasn\'t even nominated for Best Picture, nor Best Director.</p><span><a name="more"></a></span><p>A significant breakthrough occurred in 2023 when <b>Everything Everywhere All at Once</b> became the first sci-fi film to win Best Picture. How this movie and not Dune Part One won the Oscar for Best Movie, is beyond me. Nevertheless, this marked a departure from the Academy\'s traditional preferences, signaling a potential shift in recognizing the genre\'s broader contributions.&nbsp;\u200b</p><p>The Dune franchise, based on Frank Herbert\'s seminal 1965 novel, has experienced a similar pattern. <b>Dune: Part One</b> (2021) garnered six Oscars, all in technical categories, including Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, but missed out on Best Picture and Best Director. <b>Dune: Part Two</b> continued this trend with its two technical wins.&nbsp;\u200b</p><p>The consistent relegation of sci-fi films to technical categories suggests a broader industry perception that views these works primarily as showcases for technological innovation rather than as vehicles for profound storytelling or artistic expression. This perspective overlooks the genre\'s capacity to explore complex themes, envision alternative realities, and challenge societal norms.\u200b</p><p>Despite these challenges, there are signs of change. The success of Everything Everywhere All at Once in major categories indicates a growing appreciation for sci-fi narratives. Then again, I\'m wondering if the "comedy" aspect of that movie, made it more appealing then the typical serious science fiction movie.

You read that right - his full play through is almost 3 hours long!</p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><p></p><p><br /></p><p>If you don\'t have time to watch the full play through, this guide should give you a solid foundation to build upon, whether they’re new to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a>&nbsp;</em>or are looking to improve their city-building skills.&nbsp;</p><span><a name="more"></a></span><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">1. Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment. Here’s a summary of all six options to help you decide:</p><ul><li><strong>Craftsman:</strong> Increases natural resources by 25%, providing an edge in resource-heavy builds or for cities situated in resource-poor areas.</li><li><strong>Strategist:</strong> Reduces the likelihood of incidents like fires by 20%, keeping your city safe from disasters that can disrupt growth.</li><li><strong>Trader:</strong> Generates passive income from trade routes, a reliable choice if you plan on focusing on a strong economy.</li><li><strong>Politician:</strong> Allows two additional decrees to be issued at a lower cost, giving you more control over civic policies and faster access to certain upgrades.</li><li><strong>Philosopher:</strong> Boosts cultural satisfaction by 15%, making it easier to attract and retain a happy, thriving population.</li><li><strong>Priest:</strong> Citizens make regular offerings of random resources, adding a steady flow of materials that can supplement your supply chain.</li></ul><p>Each path offers distinct benefits depending on your playstyle. For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city.

Developing Infrastructure: Production and Trade Routes</h2><p>Setting up trade routes is essential for generating income and balancing resources as your city expands. In the playthrough, the author wisely establishes trade routes to sell excess stone and sand for gold, which funds additional buildings and upgrades. Here’s how to make the most of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>\' trade and production systems:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure to unlock and build both the Horreum, a large storehouse, as well as the Macellum, a large market which will open up Trade Routes. Without these two buildings trade will not be possible.</li><li>Identify surplus resources.

Check each route’s profitability and ensure you’re getting maximum value from each transaction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">6. Advanced Growth: Reaching the Tier 2 City</h2><p>As your city grows, upgrading to a Tier 2 city brings new buildings and capabilities, allowing for even greater development. However, this stage also introduces new challenges, such as managing faction tensions. Here are a few ways to make the transition smoothly:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Construct safety-focused buildings. Building structures like arenas can help reduce incidents, which become more likely as factions develop tensions.</li><li>Invest in cultural influence points. Advancing through the ages improves your city’s reputation and allows for higher-level upgrades.</li><li>Manage faction relations. Keep an eye on faction satisfaction levels and address issues before they escalate into conflicts. Certain factions may have different needs or preferences.</li><li>Create additional districts. As new buildings become available, expand your residential and industrial districts to accommodate a growing population.</li><li>Save resources for key upgrades. Some Tier 2 buildings are expensive, so stockpile resources like wood, stone, and gold to avoid delays in construction.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">7. Unlocking Wonders and Advanced Cultural Buildings</h2><p>Once you’ve secured your city’s basics, investing in wonders and advanced cultural buildings provides significant boosts. In the video, the author demonstrates how to build high-value structures like the arena and the Agoge Center to enhance influence. Here’s a guide to prioritize wonders effectively:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Focus on the Agoge Center&nbsp;or library to boost cultural influence. These buildings improve city-wide satisfaction and increase your cultural reach.</li><li>Place wonders in high-traffic areas to maximize their impact. Wonders near residential zones offer bonuses to more citizens.</li><li>Consider safety upgrades for wonder districts. Building defensive structures near wonders ensures they’re protected from incidents.</li><li>Save resources for construction. Wonders often require substantial materials, so plan to accumulate what you need before starting.</li><li>Regularly expand surveyor cabins. This allows you to build wonders farther out from the core, increasing your city’s total area.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8. Optimizing Faction Management and Decrees</h2><p>At this stage, you’ll encounter factions with unique demands. Managing these factions carefully, especially if they develop tensions, will become an important of your city management. Use decrees and policies to mitigate conflicts and enhance your city’s stability.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Issue decrees strategically. Certain decrees, such as increased food production, improve citizen satisfaction or reduce faction tensions.</li><li>Manage faction trust levels. High trust prevents conflicts, while low trust increases the likelihood of incidents and disputes.</li><li>Consider faction removal if tensions rise too high. Sometimes, expelling a problematic faction is more beneficial than dealing with constant conflicts.</li><li>Create buffers between rival factions. Placing neutral buildings or parks between contentious factions can reduce interactions and potential conflicts.</li><li>Balance decrees for all factions. Ensure that no single faction feels neglected, as this can quickly lead to dissatisfaction.</li></ul><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts and Recommendation</h2><p>Building a successful city in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;requires a careful blend of resource management, cultural development, and strategic planning.

You read that right - his full play through is almost 3 hours long!</p><div style="text-align: center;"></div><p></p><p><br /></p><p>If you don\'t have time to watch the full play through, this guide should give you a solid foundation to build upon, whether they’re new to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a>&nbsp;</em>or are looking to improve their city-building skills.&nbsp;</p><span><a name="more"></a></span><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">1. Choosing Your Destiny: Picking the Right Path</h2><p>The game begins with a crucial choice among six destinies, each setting a different path for your city’s growth and providing unique advantages. In the playthrough, the author chose the path of the philosopher, boosting cultural satisfaction by 15%. This choice is ideal for players who want to focus on keeping citizens happy and developing a rich cultural environment. Here’s a summary of all six options to help you decide:</p><ul><li><strong>Craftsman:</strong> Increases natural resources by 25%, providing an edge in resource-heavy builds or for cities situated in resource-poor areas.</li><li><strong>Strategist:</strong> Reduces the likelihood of incidents like fires by 20%, keeping your city safe from disasters that can disrupt growth.</li><li><strong>Trader:</strong> Generates passive income from trade routes, a reliable choice if you plan on focusing on a strong economy.</li><li><strong>Politician:</strong> Allows two additional decrees to be issued at a lower cost, giving you more control over civic policies and faster access to certain upgrades.</li><li><strong>Philosopher:</strong> Boosts cultural satisfaction by 15%, making it easier to attract and retain a happy, thriving population.</li><li><strong>Priest:</strong> Citizens make regular offerings of random resources, adding a steady flow of materials that can supplement your supply chain.</li></ul><p>Each path offers distinct benefits depending on your playstyle. For players who want more immediate benefits, options like craftsman or trader provide quick, tangible advantages right from the start. But starting a new game is super simple and quick. So you\'ll easily be able to test out each different path/destiny.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Building Foundations: Setting Up Your First Settlement</h2><p>After choosing a path, the next step is to establish a foundation for your city. This is where strategic placement of key buildings will save you time and resources later. Setting up the Town Center in a carefully chosen spot is essential; you’ll want it near abundant resources like wood, stone, and sand. Here’s a checklist to help you get started on the right track:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Pick a fertile, resource-rich area. Positioning your Town Center near resources will make it easier to gather essentials without stretching your workforce. Stones are usually near hills, sand and clay near water. As long as you place your Town Center near these, you should be fine.</li><li>Establish a small farm. This will provide a steady food supply for your early population and keep your citizens from starving during your city’s infancy. Start with 8 fields, then increase to the full 12 fields per farm as your population increases.</li><li>Set up a woodcutting camp and ensure it’s near the forest. It’s essential to maintain a steady supply of wood without negatively affecting residential areas.</li><li>Build a stone quarry. Stone is a critical resource for early construction, so placing your quarry close to a stone deposit will save time and improve production efficiency.</li><li>Roads automatically get connected to your buildings and infrastructures. Just realign them using the "Q" and "E" keys to rotate the building so that the they connect to roads in the most efficient - and esthetic fashion.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Unlocking the Building Tree: Expanding Your Capabilities</h2><p>The building tree is where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://playmemoriapolis.com/" target="_blank">Memoriapolis</a></em>&nbsp;shines imho, allowing players to tailor their city’s growth to specific needs. The video’s author takes a methodical approach, prioritizing buildings that increase the city\'s reach and resource management. Here’s a step-by-step approach to make the most of this feature:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Unlock the surveyor’s cabin early. Extending the build radius enables you to access valuable resources in distant areas, making it easier to expand.</li><li>Upgrade the Town Center. Once you’ve gathered enough stone and wood, this upgrade boosts the attraction range, helping your city grow faster.</li><li>Unlock the Architectural Office as soon as you can. Blueprints are an essential component of the game currency. So make sure you unlock that building and place it in your city at the earliest.</li><li>Invest in cultural buildings. These buildings will increase citizen satisfaction and attract new settlers, a great choice if you’ve chosen the philosopher path.</li><li>Progress through the building tree systematically. Avoid unlocking too many non-essential buildings early on; focus on ones that will directly support your current population and needs.</li><li>Save blueprints for later stages. As you advance, new options will open that require blueprints, so be mindful of your spending to avoid shortages when crucial upgrades are needed.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Creating a Cultural Hub: Boosting Satisfaction and Influence</h2><p>As you develop your city, focusing on making it more attractive to new settlers will pay off. This is where cultural buildings come into play. Adding a ceramic workshop early on, which fits well in attraction zones and boosts health and creativity, will be benefiting to citizens across the city. Here’s how to create a well-rounded cultural hub:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Add the ceramic workshop to a district close to residential zones, maximizing its impact on citizen satisfaction.</li><li>Balance satisfaction areas carefully: Focus on health and creativity early on to keep citizens productive and happy.</li><li>Use decorative statues within districts. Strategically placed statues improve attraction and encourage population growth.</li><li>Expand the radius of cultural buildings. When feasible, prioritize cultural buildings that have a broader impact radius to maximize their effectiveness.</li></ol><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">5.

No need to worry about respawning in an FPS firefight or letting your team down in the middle of a MOBA match (I could write a whole posts on all the insults I\'ve taken from World of Tanks players).&nbsp;</p><p>These game wait for you, not the other way around.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Meditative Moments in Gaming</h3><p>Additionally, city-building games offer something incredibly valuable in our fast-paced world: a sense of peace and mindfulness. There’s a certain meditative quality to watching your city grow, whether it\'s a bustling metropolis in Cities: Skylines or a fragile colony on the brink of collapse in Frostpunk. You’re not just reacting to what’s happening on screen; you’re crafting something from the ground up, watching your creation evolve over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s like a digital Zen garden, where each decision is a small stone you’re placing just so, bringing order to the chaos. Oh the hundreds of hours I\'ve spent in my Cities Skylines cities, beautifying them with parks, trees and endless landscaping.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Building Something That Lasts (well, sorta)</h3><p>Speaking of crafting, there’s something deeply satisfying about the “building something” aspect of these games. Unlike many other game genres where the goal is to destroy or outlast, city-builders are all about creation and longevity. In Farthest Frontier, you’re not just surviving; you’re creating a thriving settlement, planning for the future, and seeing the fruits of your labor grow season by season. It\'s a nice change of pace from the quick reflexes and high-stakes tension of other games.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Casual, But Deep</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by the seemingly laid-back nature of city-building games - they’re deceptively deep. Take Per Aspera, for example. On the surface, you’re just managing resources and expanding your colony on Mars, but dive deeper, and you’re making decisions that could impact the future of humanity on a new planet. And that\'s not counting the whole aspect of watching the AI Singularity unfold with every decision you make.</p><p>These games allow you to play at your own pace, offering a depth of strategy and planning that’s both engaging and relaxing. It\'s a perfect match for those of us who want to enjoy our gaming sessions without the pressure of keeping up with the latest trends or high-skill demands of other genres.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/s1792/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExz1qqIkjxqQmPtjwBz-ue_7oI0ZMO8sXiL4b9Qt8inhO0FLnDM85tHyw0wDl8xSwtKpoOavCxAV6TOC41VFO7wwJ2kN80Wor97jicIcukSPcc3e4nNjN3tvt2sFGg4zXu_a3c4Olre1F2jaw_8507BAJFAnKhJ7-qsJV-MZCIylwDLOa4C0qdg/w640-h366/DALL%C2%B7E%202024-09-01%2007.56.45%20-%20A%20hyper-detailed%20landscape%20image%20of%20a%20vibrant,%20bustling%20city%20inspired%20by%20city-building%20games.%20The%20city%20should%20include%20a%20mix%20of%20towering%20skyscrapers,%20n.webp" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br /></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Different Kind of Challenge</h3><p>Sure, there’s something exhilarating about a well-timed headshot in an FPS or a perfectly executed combo in a MOBA, but city-building games present a different kind of challenge.

I decided to pull together some straightforward tips and tricks to keep me from making the same mistakes next time. Along the way, I stumbled upon some cool playthroughs that actually showed me what I should be doing. The guide below is what came out of that little project.&nbsp;</p><p>Hope it helps you dodge the newbie moves and maybe even enjoy the game a bit more. Let’s get back in there and show them what we’ve got!</p><p><br /></p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">World of Tanks || Super Hellcat - Tank Review</h2><span><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"></div></span><span><a name="more"></a></span><h2 style="text-align: left;">Playing the Super Hellcat</h2><p>Playing as a Tank Destroyer (TD) in World of Tanks, particularly with vehicles like the Super Hellcat and Hellcat, requires a good mix of tactical awareness, map knowledge, and understanding of the vehicle\'s strengths and weaknesses. Someone with extensive experience piloting TDs would likely tell you that the following are the best setups, crew skills, and playstyle strategies to help your team secure victory.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Vehicle Setup in Detail</h3><h4 style="text-align: left;">Equipment Choices</h4><p>For both the Hellcat and Super Hellcat, the goal is to maximize their strengths: mobility, concealment, and firepower.</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Optics (Binocular Telescope or Coated Optics)</b>: Increasing your view range is critical. Spotting enemies before they spot you allows you to make informed decisions on when to shoot and when to relocate. The choice between Binocular Telescope and Coated Optics depends on your playstyle; Binoculars for more stationary play and Coated Optics for more active scouting and repositioning.</li><li><b>Gun Rammer</b>: Reducing your reload time significantly increases your Damage Per Minute (DPM), making you a bigger threat on the battlefield. Being able to shoot more frequently means you can exploit enemy tanks\' vulnerabilities more often.</li><li><b>Camo Net / Turbocharger</b>: The choice here is between enhancing your stealth with a Camo Net or boosting your mobility with a Turbocharger.

Here’s a breakdown of which vehicles a Hellcat should consider partnering with and why:</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Medium Tanks</h3><div>Medium tanks are versatile and can perform a wide range of roles, making them excellent partners for the Hellcat. Their balance of speed, armor, and firepower allows them to effectively scout, flank, and engage enemies at various ranges. A Hellcat can support medium tanks by providing additional firepower from a second line or by exploiting openings created by the mediums’ aggressive maneuvers. This pairing can quickly adapt to changing battlefield conditions, moving to support weakened flanks or to capitalize on enemy vulnerabilities.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Heavy Tanks</h3><div>While heavy tanks lack the Hellcat’s mobility, they make up for it with superior armor and firepower. Teaming up with heavy tanks allows the Hellcat to operate from behind the frontline, using the heavies as a shield while it delivers precise shots. This partnership is especially effective in areas with good cover and long sightlines, where the Hellcat can use its excellent gun to support the heavy tanks without exposing itself to enemy fire. The Hellcat should avoid blocking the retreat paths of allied heavy tanks and remain ready to reposition if the enemy breaks through the frontline.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Other TDs</h3><div>Pairing with other TDs, especially those with strong frontal armor, can create a formidable defensive line that can deter enemy advances. The Hellcat, with its good mobility, can act as a scout or flanker for this group, identifying targets for the more heavily armored TDs to engage. However, this requires good communication and coordination to ensure that the Hellcat does not become isolated or targeted by enemy artillery.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Artillery</h3><div>While not directly tagging along with artillery, a Hellcat can play a crucial role in protecting these valuable assets from enemy scouts and light tanks. By staying relatively close to friendly artillery, the Hellcat can use its mobility and firepower to intercept and eliminate threats to the team’s artillery pieces, ensuring they can continue to support the team effectively.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Light Tanks</h3><div>A somewhat less common but potentially effective partnership can be formed with light tanks. Light tanks excel in scouting and can quickly identify key enemy positions. A Hellcat following a light tank at a safe distance can capitalize on the scouting information, using its accurate gun to take out spotted enemies before they can react. However, this requires the Hellcat to stay alert and ready to move, as the light tank’s fast-paced scouting can lead them into rapidly changing situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>When pairing with any vehicle, the key for the Hellcat driver is to maintain situational awareness and adapt to the battle’s flow. The Hellcat\'s strength lies in its ability to deliver impactful damage from positions where it is not easily targeted. Effective communication with teammates and choosing the right moments to strike or relocate are crucial for leveraging the Hellcat’s capabilities to their fullest.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">How NOT to play the Super Hellcat!</h2></span></div><p style="text-align: left;">One of the worst ways to play the Hellcat in World of Tanks is to treat it like a frontline brawler or a heavy tank. The Hellcat is equipped with a powerful gun and excellent mobility but suffers from very thin armor and a relatively open turret design, making it highly vulnerable to enemy fire from almost all types of weapons it encounters on the battlefield.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Key Mistakes in Playing the Hellcat as a Frontline Tank:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Engaging in Direct Firefights: Attempting to trade shots with enemy tanks, especially heavies or well-armored mediums and TDs, is a quick way to get destroyed. The Hellcat\'s armor is insufficient to absorb hits, and its relatively large profile for a TD makes it an easy target when exposed.</li><li>Ignoring Cover and Concealment: Failing to use the terrain, bushes, and other forms of cover to hide your tank and mask your movements negates one of the Hellcat\'s main strengths – its ability to strike unseen. Being visible on the front lines means you\'ll likely be one of the first targets to be fired upon.</li><li>Static Gameplay: Staying in one position for too long, especially on the front lines, can make you an easy target for enemy artillery and tanks. The Hellcat thrives on its ability to relocate quickly, providing support where it\'s needed and avoiding return fire.</li><li>Not Using its Mobility: The Hellcat\'s speed is a key feature that allows it to flex across the map, responding to threats, reinforcing failing flanks, or exploiting gaps in the enemy lines. Playing it in a stationary, frontline role wastes this potential, making the tank much less effective than it could be.</li></ul><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How to Avoid These Mistakes:</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Play to Your Strengths: Use the Hellcat\'s mobility and excellent gun handling to engage enemies from unexpected angles, relocate frequently to avoid being targeted, and always look for opportunities to support your team from a distance or the second line.</li><li>Stay Aware: Keep an eye on the mini-map and be ready to move if you\'re in danger of being flanked, or if there\'s a more advantageous position you can take to support your team.</li><li>Engage Wisely: Choose your battles carefully. Look for targets that are engaged with your teammates, isolated, or presenting their weaker armor to you. Avoid head-on engagements with tanks that can easily outgun or outarmor you.</li></ul><p></p><p>By avoiding the frontline brawler playstyle and focusing on mobility, stealth, and strategic engagement, you\'ll greatly increase your effectiveness and survivability in the Hellcat, turning it into a formidable asset for your team.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Final thoughts...</h2><p>Mastering the Hellcat and Super Hellcat requires patience, good positioning, and an understanding of when to engage or retreat. Remember, your primary role is to support your team by providing accurate and timely damage from a distance or flanking. Avoid direct confrontations with heavier tanks unless you have a clear advantage or support. By following these strategies and adjusting your playstyle based on the battle\'s flow, you\'ll become a valuable asset to your team and help secure victory on the battlefield.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://feeds.feedburner.com/CrazykinuxsMusing', 'value': '<p>Jumping back into World of Tanks after long hiatus, and a big update felt a bit like a cold splash of water yesterday - especially when I dove straight into battle with my Super Hellcat and ended up more like a skittish kitten hiding in the bushes (literally) than the fierce TD I should\'ve been.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, my gameplay was rusty, and the match didn’t go well at all.

This time around, the F/X team, under <a href="https://www.artofvfx.com/dune-part-two/" target="_blank">Paul Lambert\u200b\'s direction</a>, is expected to push the boundaries further, bringing to life the epic battles and the awe-inspiring sandworms with even more detail and realism.</p><p>As for the future of the Dune franchise, speculation is rife. With Part Two likely to cover the remainder of the first book, fans are eagerly discussing the possibility of Villeneuve tackling Dune Messiah - as he had indicated that he would not continue beyond a third film. Given his success with the franchise so far, the prospect of Villeneuve continuing to guide the saga is an exciting one - whether behind the camera or as an executive producer. His vision has redefined what epic science fiction cinema can be (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049), and the potential for further exploring the rich universe of Dune under his direction is a tantalizing prospect.</p><p>Dune: Part Two isn\'t just a movie to me, and to most Dune fans; it\'s an event. And hopefully the continuation of a whole new and fresh movie franchise. With its compelling storyline, Villeneuve\'s visionary direction, Zimmer\'s haunting score, and jaw-dropping F/X, the film is set to be a cinematic landmark. As I look to the future, the possibility of continuing this journey through the Dune saga with Villeneuve at the helm is a prospect that fills us with anticipation.&nbsp;</p><p>So, grab your stillsuit and prepare to walk the sands of Arrakis once again - I\'ll be doing so tonight (minus the stillsuit of course!😆)</p><p>The universe of Dune awaits, and its mysteries are more compelling than ever.</p>'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/the-sands-of-arrakis-beckon-again-dune.html'}], 'link': 'http://www.crazykinux.ca/2024/02/the-sands-of-arrakis-beckon-again-dune.html', 'authors': [{'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author': 'noreply@blogger.com (CrazyKinux)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'CrazyKinux', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://img.youtube.com/vi/VC7-OcFvVEw/default.jpg', 'height': '72', 'width': '72'}], 'href': '', 'thr_total': '0'}

Tolkien remains a figure of intriguing complexity, and in some cases contradiction. As a devout Roman Catholic and a lover of Roman languages, Tolkien\'s aversion to the Roman Empire stands out as a remarkable paradox. As one explores Tolkien\'s complex relationship with the Roman Empire and its influence on his work, one cannot deny his deep-seated values of localism and traditionalism.</p><p></p><blockquote><i>In Tolkien\'s Middle-earth, we find a reflection of his ideological battle—a world where the preservation of diversity stands as a testament to the resilience of local cultures against the tides of conquest and cultural erasure.</i></blockquote><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Tolkien\'s Ideological Conflict</h2><p>At the heart of Tolkien\'s paradoxical stance is his deep admiration for the Roman people and their culture juxtaposed with his disdain for the Roman Empire. This aversion did not stem from a dislike of Roman achievements in engineering, governance, or the arts, but from the empire\'s approach to conquest and cultural eradication. Tolkien, despite his affection for Latin and Roman Catholicism, viewed the empire as antithetical to his cherished principles of localism and traditionalism.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Influence of the Roman Empire on Tolkien\'s Work</h2><p>The shadow of the Roman Empire looms subtly over Tolkien\'s Middle-earth, with the city of <b>Minas Tirith</b> drawing inspiration from the historical <b>Constantinople</b> and themes of decline echoing the fall of ancient civilizations. However, Tolkien\'s engagement with these inspirations does not translate into an outright admiration for the empire\'s historical actions. Instead, he repurposes elements of Roman history and mythology to enrich his fictional world, all the while embedding a critique of imperialism and cultural homogenization.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">A Champion of Localism and Traditionalism</h2><p>Tolkien\'s ideology was profoundly rooted in a love for <b>England</b>, a preference for localized, distinct cultures, and languages. His opposition to the <b>Roman Empire</b>\'s empire-building and suppression of local traditions stems from this deep-seated belief. Through his writings and personal letters, Tolkien consistently advocated for the preservation of local customs, languages, and independence, opposing any form of imperialism that threatened these values. His narrative worlds are testament to his belief in the coexistence of diverse cultures and the preservation of their unique identities.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Reflecting Ideals Through Middle-earth</h2><p>Middle-earth serves as a canvas for Tolkien to articulate his ideals. The coexistence of distinct cultures, languages, and traditions within Middle-earth mirrors Tolkien\'s opposition to the homogenizing force of empires. Characters and societies in his work often face threats from forces seeking to dominate and erase diversity, reflecting Tolkien\'s critique of imperialism. Through his fictional narratives, Tolkien advocates for a world where diversity is not only preserved but celebrated.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Latin, Catholicism, and Cultural Unity</h2><p>Tolkien\'s advocacy for the use of Latin in Catholic services might seem contradictory to his localist views at first glance. However, Tolkien saw Latin as a unifying element of the Catholic Church, one that connected its history to the present without undermining local languages and cultures. His stance is a nuanced one that distinguishes between cultural appreciation and political dominion.

Tolkien remains a figure of intriguing complexity, and in some cases contradiction. As a devout Roman Catholic and a lover of Roman languages, Tolkien\'s aversion to the Roman Empire stands out as a remarkable paradox. As one explores Tolkien\'s complex relationship with the Roman Empire and its influence on his work, one cannot deny his deep-seated values of localism and traditionalism.</p><p></p><blockquote><i>In Tolkien\'s Middle-earth, we find a reflection of his ideological battle—a world where the preservation of diversity stands as a testament to the resilience of local cultures against the tides of conquest and cultural erasure.</i></blockquote><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Tolkien\'s Ideological Conflict</h2><p>At the heart of Tolkien\'s paradoxical stance is his deep admiration for the Roman people and their culture juxtaposed with his disdain for the Roman Empire. This aversion did not stem from a dislike of Roman achievements in engineering, governance, or the arts, but from the empire\'s approach to conquest and cultural eradication. Tolkien, despite his affection for Latin and Roman Catholicism, viewed the empire as antithetical to his cherished principles of localism and traditionalism.<span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Influence of the Roman Empire on Tolkien\'s Work</h2><p>The shadow of the Roman Empire looms subtly over Tolkien\'s Middle-earth, with the city of <b>Minas Tirith</b> drawing inspiration from the historical <b>Constantinople</b> and themes of decline echoing the fall of ancient civilizations. However, Tolkien\'s engagement with these inspirations does not translate into an outright admiration for the empire\'s historical actions. Instead, he repurposes elements of Roman history and mythology to enrich his fictional world, all the while embedding a critique of imperialism and cultural homogenization.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">A Champion of Localism and Traditionalism</h2><p>Tolkien\'s ideology was profoundly rooted in a love for <b>England</b>, a preference for localized, distinct cultures, and languages. His opposition to the <b>Roman Empire</b>\'s empire-building and suppression of local traditions stems from this deep-seated belief. Through his writings and personal letters, Tolkien consistently advocated for the preservation of local customs, languages, and independence, opposing any form of imperialism that threatened these values. His narrative worlds are testament to his belief in the coexistence of diverse cultures and the preservation of their unique identities.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Reflecting Ideals Through Middle-earth</h2><p>Middle-earth serves as a canvas for Tolkien to articulate his ideals. The coexistence of distinct cultures, languages, and traditions within Middle-earth mirrors Tolkien\'s opposition to the homogenizing force of empires. Characters and societies in his work often face threats from forces seeking to dominate and erase diversity, reflecting Tolkien\'s critique of imperialism. Through his fictional narratives, Tolkien advocates for a world where diversity is not only preserved but celebrated.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Latin, Catholicism, and Cultural Unity</h2><p>Tolkien\'s advocacy for the use of Latin in Catholic services might seem contradictory to his localist views at first glance. However, Tolkien saw Latin as a unifying element of the Catholic Church, one that connected its history to the present without undermining local languages and cultures. His stance is a nuanced one that distinguishes between cultural appreciation and political dominion. For Tolkien, Latin represented a spiritual and cultural heritage that transcended the political ambitions of the Roman Empire, aligning with his vision of a world united in diversity rather than uniformity.</p><p style="text-align: center;">*********************************</p><p>Tolkien\'s paradoxical stance on the Roman Empire reflects a complex interplay of admiration and aversion, deeply intertwined with his values and beliefs.

Work? I don&#8217;t wanna get up. Mowing my yard? God, I just don&#8217;t <strong>want </strong>to do it. Making dinner? Man, that&#8217;s so much effort. But like, once I&#8217;m actually started, actually in it, I&#8217;m fine. I can work through the lack of motivation, plow through to the end of whatever task I&#8217;m on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take for example this past Saturday, driving up to my dad&#8217;s hometown to buy pizza for his (early) birthday dinner. It&#8217;s a two-plus hour drive, and I&#8217;d been conscripted into doing the drive up so that I&#8217;d know how to do it in the future, know how to get to his old stomping grounds, yadda, yadda. I wanted to go, but I wasn&#8217;t necessarily up for doing the driving. But once I was in the car, on the highway, I enjoyed it. I made the drive with little issue, got myself into the busiest part of town, and to the specific pizza shop he wants when we&#8217;re up there. My mom drove back partially because it was all she could do to <strong>not </strong>drive, and we would be going a way I had almost no experience with because of road construction. It was a nice trip back, saw a bunch of small towns I loved the look of, a bunch of sights I otherwise wouldn&#8217;t had I just stayed home and stared at my computer, you know, the usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or mowing my yard yesterday, I spent all morning dreading actually doing it, then once I was out there, I blew through a solid half of my part of the yard in one go. My brother relieved me to do his sections, then I tore through the rest with no issue after I tagged back in. I spent Saturday night in a state of &#8220;damnit, I don&#8217;t wanna do this&#8221; as I tried to sleep, but once I started, it wasn&#8217;t that bad. Both of it, and the painting we did this weekend, look pretty good if I say so myself. Front door looks nice, front room is done (save for one wall), the yard looks cleaned up for the year, it was worth the hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>But my biggest problem with anything I do, is just starting it. I have a ton of games that I want to play, pieces I want to write, maybe streaming again, but my biggest hurdle is making myself get started on any of those things. The Witcher 3 is high on my list of games to play, but I look at it on my Steam list, look at the install, remember the what felt like years to get let loose in the world, and my urge to play it dries up like the desert. To the point where I just load up one of the few games I do play, and do things that don&#8217;t involve any kind of massive time investment or mental bandwidth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, I talk a big game about how me and 16-year-old me would butt hears about getting started, but 34-year-old me is only better at getting in gear for the things he <strong>has</strong> to get up for. Work? Yeah, I got bills to pay, let&#8217;s get up and go. The things I actually <strong>want</strong> (or really should) do, like playing a game, or mowing my yard (or installing these windows&#8230;), &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna, I just want to zone out for a while&#8221;. And it infuriates me because I know that I&#8217;m just wasting daylight sitting and doing nothing, but nothing sounds like a good thing to do after doing something all day at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the toll that work is putting on me, but recently, the very idea of <strong>doing anything</strong> has made me miserable. Calls are up, clients are especially irritable, and the plates refuse to stop spinning for even one day. And by the time I&#8217;m settled in for the night, my mind is too torched to even consider starting up something else to balance and wedge into my day. Because the last thing I want to do is spend an hour watching a game before I can even move my guy around. If I wanted to do that, I&#8217;d just load up FFXIV and try to slog through the MSQ and Wuk Lamat&#8217;s overwhelming presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Like, right now the idea of writing doesn&#8217;t sound like climbing Everest ten times in a row, because I&#8217;m already in it. But when I build my spaceships in something like No Man&#8217;s Sky and think &#8220;man I want to write about how much fun I&#8217;m having building spaceships&#8221;, it feels like I&#8217;m climbing a mountain with no arms or legs. &#8220;I want to, but that sounds exhausting and I just wanna sleep&#8221; is usually the best excuse I give myself. And I hate it. I really do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how to fix this, other than follow my own dogma of &#8220;the only thing stopping you is you&#8221; when my brother gripes about not starting something himself. Maybe I should take my own advice and realize that the only thing stopping me from starting, is me. I installed X4 and Empyrion earlier today, and I want to at least try one of these games, like I had to make myself do with Space Engineers, whether I like any of them or not, and now I have no excuse as to why I haven&#8217;t. The games are there and ready to roll whenever, it&#8217;s on me to follow through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I start, I&#8217;ll be fine, I&#8217;ll enjoy whatever it is that I&#8217;m doing, that drive home wouldn&#8217;t have been nearly as interesting if we took the same route and had to fight traffic, but the prospect of doing something not even new, but starting something at exhausting to me. It shouldn&#8217;t be, but, it is. And until I can get myself past whatever hang up I have about doing the stuff on my lists of want-and-need-to-do-s, I&#8217;ll just sit in a numb haze repeating the same day five times in a row. I don&#8217;t want that, I want to actually try and start new things instead of being stuck on the few things I don&#8217;t have to think about to placate myself.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/10/06/10-6-2025-the-only-thing-stopping-you-is-you/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_2034.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_2034.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

What got on my mind was the even-further ingrained into my head idea that the more I slow down and not try to overdo things, the better my results are. Now, this is a battle I constantly have to have with myself, but, it&#8217;s one that I probably <strong>need</strong> to keep having. But, try explaining that to my subconscious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, a few weeks back now, I was cranking out the 110 ranks I needed to complete the Season/Expansion/wtf-ever Pass in Destiny 2. With the final ten ranks requiring five-times the experience per-level needed to get a level from 1-100, I was trying everything I could. I ground out missions, strikes, Solo Ops, anything that would knock out these Seasonal Challenges to get me further along the pass. I did so many that I ran out of Challenges to complete that didn&#8217;t involve getting a pick-up group to run Dungeons or Raids, which meant&#8230;Crucible. PvP, player versus player. The bane of my existence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a couple of Challenges I was zeroing in on, Scout Rifle and Solar kills particularly. So, I opted to do both at once, enter Polaris Lance, a Solar Scout that needs you hit your shots consistently to get use out of it. And do you, dear listener, know what I did? I hung back, I hit those shots, and I won more games than I lost in that run. I finished the Pass with two days to spare, got my cosmetics, and got the hell out of dodge. &#8220;Ash &amp; Iron&#8221; is trash, thus, I haven&#8217;t played since it dropped, and I haven&#8217;t bought the pass. But, passes kind of sort of don&#8217;t expire now, so my mad rush to finish them isn&#8217;t necessary any longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>But to go back to me in the Crucible, I played against every impulse I had to run ahead, to feed kills and Super energy to my opponents, and because of that, when my teams lost, it was close in every game but one. I hung back, I stayed glued to my teammates, I didn&#8217;t make any unreasonable, risky pushes to take Zones or chase down a kill. Which, is something I should be doing in general, with everything I do. Push when I know that I can get away with it, rather than push because it&#8217;s a day ending in -Y.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had games where <strong>I </strong>topped the scoreboard for my team, me, who can&#8217;t keep a K/D/R over 0.7 the majority of the time in whatever competitive game I play. I wasn&#8217;t trying to swipe kills from my team, I was hanging back to make sure I landed my shots, and didn&#8217;t feed the other team. Sure, I didn&#8217;t get the number of kills I&#8217;d have liked, but the assists still stacked up, I grabbed kills where I could, and wound up knocking out a couple more PvP challenges than I&#8217;d anticipated to, in far less time than I&#8217;d thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I would normally run in with an auto or SMG, instead, I was hanging back, making sure I stayed with at least one teammate instead of going solo, and using the cover in each area. If I saw an enemy, I didn&#8217;t immediately engage without an exit plan, I played like I was on a team, instead of being an island unto myself. Doing that let me win duels, being one bullet ahead instead of a bullet behind, it even let me come out of a couple 2v1 fights alive where normally I&#8217;d get swallowed whole. Even being down a player, and going 6v5 didn&#8217;t rattle me like I normally would get, because I stuck to the plan I made for myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>See, I typically get incredibly stressed out in PvP, which leads to me feeding the other team, and occupying a permanent place at the bottom of a leaderboard. I tense up when I encounter an enemy, get shaky, and nervous about every duel I wind up in. What I did was bite down on my tongue each time I started to get that nervous feeling and shaky when I got into a fight. It isn&#8217;t a &#8220;healthy&#8221; response, but, it did keep my mind from spiraling as I played each match. That, and putting something on to mindlessly listen to while I played didn&#8217;t hurt either, I could zone out and just focus on what was in front of me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that kept me from overthinking, over analyzing, just twisting myself into knots to the point where I couldn&#8217;t be effective. Which is what normally happens when I get myself stressed out, I become so shaky and nervous that I make every mistake in the book trying to hold together. When I&#8217;d died, between respawns I&#8217;d make myself take a deep breath, recenter myself, and try to get back to a teammate when I got back in. Doing that, I could get the jump on the enemy, instead of getting double-teamed myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing my rank go up in PvP, seeing my name not at the bottom of the board, it was pretty cool. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m going to do <strong>often</strong>, but to finish out a Pass, I&#8217;ll go slam my head on a wall for a bit. As long as I don&#8217;t play outright stupidly, I can hold serve long enough to get where I need to be, get my time in the mines over with as quickly as I can. As long as I can keep a hold of myself, not let myself get too overwhelmed by the task, I know I&#8217;m decent enough to not feel like I&#8217;m getting lapped by every player, just most of them.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/09/21/9-21-2025-play-smarter-not-harder/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_2033.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_2033.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I know it&#8217;s not &#8220;good&#8221;, but damnit I built this thing and I&#8217;ll make it good later!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahem. So, I&#8217;ve been playing a lot of No Man&#8217;s Sky since the Voyager update, where you can now build your own &#8220;Corvette&#8221; class ship to fly around in, and walk around in like it&#8217;s your own portable base. Last night, I finally worked up the money to buy all the parts I need to make me a Corvette, because I don&#8217;t know how the Expedition system works, and I&#8217;ve been too sick to give a damn about how to go about it and get a free Corvette (seriously, I feel like crap. Send help. Or more DayQuil and NyQuil.). Mine&#8230;is not great. It has the bare minimum of what you need to make it flight-worthy, and it shows. It&#8217;s a clunky, ugly mess that will get me from Points A to B, and not much else. But, it&#8217;s <strong>mine</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have hauled junked ships to Stations to scrap them, I have scrambled for my life from Sentinels as the game turns into Ace Combat 04 in space, all in the name of building my own ship. And I finally got it done around 11pm last night, flew it into a planet, and am seeing the good and the bad of it. The good, I have what amounts to a Pelican from Halo. The bad, the landing gear makes it ugly as sin, and I have this thing super vulnerable with the reactor being a massive target. It&#8217;s also very cramped inside, just enough room to jump out of the flight seat, and run around the hold while I&#8217;m on autopilot. When the Sentinels came on the planet I hit, I closed the hatch and looked out the cockpit. &#8220;At least I&#8217;m safe inside my mind&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like making something is a point of pride for me. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s in a game, or real life, that stuff is fulfilling to me. I still have two windows in my house to fix before winter, and if I ever get off my back to do it, I&#8217;ll be super satisfied with my work. Will it be &#8220;pretty&#8221;? No, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. It just has to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I can always reconfigure the Corvette later once I have access to better components. I just wanted to get one of my own built while the drive to play the game is still there. I have some things to trick it out with, but, not as many as I&#8217;d like, nor the experience with the system to really experiment with it. It makes me happy, and that&#8217;s really all I can ask for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ordered takeout tonight, and while it&#8217;s good, it just doesn&#8217;t have the same impact for me as the meals I cooked over the weekend did. My family still isn&#8217;t feeling great, and it was 4pm before the thought of making dinner finally sprang forty because work was busy. I don&#8217;t exactly feel proud of spending $30 on takeout, when if I <strong>really </strong>wanted to, I could have come up with something myself. It just &#8220;is&#8221; rather than is a dish that I can hang my hat on and say &#8220;yeah, <strong>I </strong>made that. I don&#8217;t care if you didn&#8217;t like it, I&#8217;m proud of myself for making it.&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>When I pick up the game again, I&#8217;ll still be going towards the center of the galaxy, but, I also want to keep amassing parts to make my ship my own. Sure, I have a Freighter, I have a (tiny) base, and I have my starting ship, but I want to make my stuff truly my own. Like with my little Corvette-class. It&#8217;s Spartan right now, but, I can make it fancy if I want to. I can make it to my very own liking if it so suits me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the point of it, though, that makes it &#8220;worth it&#8221; to me. That I took these disparate pieces and smashed something together that sure, someone else <strong>could </strong>have done for me, but, was more intrinsically valuable to me by doing it myself. I have projects in real life that yes, I need to hire someone to do, and that&#8217;s fine. But the ones that I can fix myself?

Fixing my windows? I can swing that. I don&#8217;t need specialized tools, I just have to do it. Same with building up Relics, or bases, or ships.

It feels like after today, it&#8217;s back into the pipe until the end of May next year. It isn&#8217;t, but, that feeling doesn&#8217;t ever go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I live (around Cincinnati), one of the local radio stations has a big fireworks show on the Ohio River on the night before Labor Day, that gets shown on one of the local tv stations each year on a rotating basis. It&#8217;s kind of a farewell to the season, a way to celebrate one last time before &#8220;real life&#8221; starts back up in earnest. And with it being literally at the end of August this year, the end of the Blaugust event, it has me wistful and wishing the summer never ended. Kind of like how I felt as a kid, when the fireworks felt like summer ended, even though I&#8217;d been back at a school for a week or two at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mowed my yard for what will probably be the last time this year, and while it was easier than it had been all season, it felt sad to do, because it&#8217;s the tail end of doing it until the spring. I can feel the days getting shorter, the weather has been cooler than before, and in my mind, it feels like time slipping away. It hasn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve been plenty busy this summer, I&#8217;ve done plenty of things, made changes I needed to make, it&#8217;s not like I haven&#8217;t done anything. But in my mind, I don&#8217;t want the season to end on me, I don&#8217;t want Blaugust to end, I don&#8217;t want the calendar to flip over tonight. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll say that I hate the summer, that winter is my favorite season, but I don&#8217;t <strong>really </strong>hate it. I don&#8217;t like the heat, I don&#8217;t like that my beleaguered baseball team is absolute dog water every year, the things I can&#8217;t control. I miss it when it&#8217;s gone, and don&#8217;t really appreciate it while it&#8217;s here like I should. Especially when it&#8217;s hitting zero on the thermometer, and I&#8217;m freezing to death even with the heaters roaring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer is freedom to me, even though I&#8217;ve been &#8220;free&#8221; for years now, with the exception of my job. It&#8217;s meant that I can spend that time doing what I want to do, going where I want to go, even though I can just <strong>do </strong>that whenever now. It&#8217;s meant that I don&#8217;t have to coop up in this house, that I can grab the car keys and go somewhere like I did yesterday. It&#8217;s probably a holdover from my childhood, but, what isn&#8217;t at this point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230;I should really just use my PTO and realize that there&#8217;s three other seasons, and that just because it&#8217;s colder/freezing/not as warm, that I can just go do things without waiting for the calendar to say June/July/August. Just because summer is ending, it doesn&#8217;t mean that I can&#8217;t just take some time and go do something that interests me. It isn&#8217;t like I can&#8217;t just jump into the car at 5pm on a cold January evening and drive around for an hour because it &#8220;isn&#8217;t the right months&#8221;. Or take a trip to the city and go shopping for something I&#8217;ve wanted and don&#8217;t want to order online. I don&#8217;t <strong>have </strong>to be responsible <strong>all the time</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Because in my mind, those other seasons? Those are when I have to be &#8220;responsible&#8221;, have to be buttoned up and an adult, while in the summer, I can screw around and get weird with it. Which hasn&#8217;t been the case for a long time, since my &#8220;responsible&#8221; time is &#8220;between the hours of 7am-4pm, Monday-Friday&#8221;, and all through the year. After that, I can be a screwball weirdo all I want, as long as I&#8217;m not hurting anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with Blaugust, it feels like it&#8217;s my chance to get really experimental with how I write, even though there&#8217;s no rule book <strong>to</strong> writing like this. I can get weird all year! Why am I stocking up my stream-of-consciousness yapping to burn on one month, instead of just doing weird shit whenever I want? It&#8217;s not like the Blog Gods are going to come down and smite me for writing about baseball in January!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That freedom to go off the map is there all year, and I need to learn how to just run with it. That &#8220;summer vacation&#8221; for me is just a state of mind, not a reality I have to live with any longer. That fireworks show tonight will be the &#8220;unofficial&#8221; end of summer, but that summer doesn&#8217;t have to end for me. I can make it last forever in my mind if I want to, I don&#8217;t have to let that freedom go just because the calendar and the leaves change.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/31/blaugust2025-day-31-end-of-the-line/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_1751-1.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_1751-1.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

A rematch from the semifinals in last year&#8217;s Playoff, the marquee game of the opening weekend, yadda, yadda, yadda. I didn&#8217;t watch it. Not because I don&#8217;t care about my Buckeyes, but, because I knew that I could not handle the stress of it. I know how I am, and you could door me up on happy pills until the cows came home, they would not touch that kind of anxiety that comes from this team that I put way too much of my mental health into every autumn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We won, by the way. 14-7 against the preseason number one, made Arch Manning look lost, made <strong>two </strong>goal-line stands, and at least for one week, I stave off that stress-induced heart attack that <strong>will </strong>kill me one of these days. New starting Quarterback Julian Sayin did what he needed to, didn&#8217;t blow it, and the defense looked like a pack of killers from what I&#8217;ve gleaned post-game. Are we good enough to repeat as National Champions? Probably not, but I feel very lucky that I&#8217;ve gotten to see three Natties in my lifetime, and I&#8217;m still in that post-championship glow period. As long as we beat Michigan this year, I&#8217;ll take not winning a championship. I&#8217;ll take the gold pants over a gold trophy if I have to choose between the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those not drowned in why I&#8217;ve seen be described as &#8220;midwestern Doom Opera&#8221;, Ohio State&#8217;s biggest rival is Michigan. Every year, they play in what is known simply as &#8220;The Game&#8221;. No trophy, no cute rivalry name, no. It is &#8220;The Game&#8221;, and Ohio State has lost the last four games in the series, after winning seven of them in a row. That game, plays havoc so badly on my nerves that I will do nearly <strong>anything </strong>to <strong>not</strong> watch it. I will clean my house, I will work overtime at my job, I will go drive to god-knows-where to get something, or just go where there is no cell service so that I won&#8217;t be able to check the score. Those aren&#8217;t examples I&#8217;ve pulled from thin air, either. I&#8217;ve done <strong>all </strong>of those things in the past to not watch The Game. This game against Texas? I was hitting that level of stress a month ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;d I do to mitigate it? I ran errands, I went and did things, I did as much as I possibly could to push this game out of my mind as long as I could stand it. I took my mom for coffee, I went to Lowe&#8217;s and bought paint, I went to the Amish bakery, I bought mums to plant, I drove to Walmart and hemmed and hawed about what pens I wanted to buy, I drove to another county blasting my music just because I could. I did all these things, and still the need to check that score crept in. So, when I got to a place to pull off, I did just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth quarter, 3:28 to go, and Texas just scored. Shit, here it comes. My anxiety goes from a 3 on the scale of 1-10, to a 12. I throw on more music, I throw on a podcast, even my beloved Hangman Page&#8217;s theme, &#8220;Ghost Town Triumph&#8221; can&#8217;t dull the nerves for me. When I finally muster the nerve to check in again, I see it. &#8220;Ohio State 14, Texas 7, End of Game&#8221;. Oh my god. Oh my god! They&#8217;ve done it! I&#8217;m over the moon, all my stress fades away in an instant. I&#8217;m now 30 miles from home and at a stop sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My drive home wasn&#8217;t nearly as nerve-wracking as my drive to where I wound up. Sure, it&#8217;s a holiday weekend, and there are cops crawling the highway, whatever, I&#8217;m driving exactly the speed limit. I turn off to a backroad that will get me most of the way to where I want to get off of the highway at to go home. I know this song and dance, I used this road many a time to dodge cops setting speed traps in those four years I spent driving this highway every day. I know where they camp at, I know <strong>when </strong>they camp. Me turning off and driving a lesser-used road that gets me to the same place a little slower than the highway is no big deal to me. Maybe the happy pill <strong>is </strong>working, because the two cops I saw in that town would have scared the life out of me a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>But, all that is a way for me to kind of realize that I don&#8217;t <strong>have </strong>to set myself into a pressure cooker every time there&#8217;s something that will stress me out. I get stressed over high-stakes football games, okay, I don&#8217;t <strong>have</strong> to watch them? I can watch them after the fact, or just skip it altogether if it&#8217;s a result I don&#8217;t like. If that tOSU/UTexas game comes on as a rerun sometime, hell <strong>yes</strong> I&#8217;ll watch it. Ohio State/Michigan from 2021-whenever we finally can beat them again? Nah. I can skip it. My coworker hasn&#8217;t given me <strong>too much </strong>crap about it the past few years, and my new boss is a Texas fan, so, I probably shouldn&#8217;t needle him about this game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same with seeing those cops while I was driving. I think I can trust myself more than I used to, know that as long as I&#8217;m not doing anything wrong, they have no reason to pull me over. I&#8217;m driving the speed limit, I&#8217;m not driving erratically, I&#8217;m not on my phone, I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;m supposed to, I shouldn&#8217;t need to panic. Maybe it&#8217;s the happy pills talking, but I drove past a speed check on my journey, and didn&#8217;t lose my mind immediately when I saw the cop. Okay, speed limit&#8217;s 45 and I&#8217;m going 44, we&#8217;re good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When that last Saturday of November comes up, I&#8217;ll probably do the same thing. Ideally, I won&#8217;t have to take a cat to the Vet that day, like in 2022, but, I can find things to occupy my mind the majority of it. I can make a long drive to somewhere if it means I don&#8217;t turn into a puddle of nerves at the sight of the colors Maize and Blue. I can throw my music on, listen to my podcasts, find diversions to take the stress and anxiety of this thing I can&#8217;t control off of me for long enough for it to go down, the dust to settle, and me to calm my nerves. I could drive someplace I&#8217;ve never been if the idea strikes me in that moment. It&#8217;d probably be more fun than staring at a tv for four hours in a full-blown panic attack.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/30/blaugust2025-day-30-dont-think-about-it/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_2012.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_2012.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I did all the usual pleasantries, &#8220;old and sleepy, haha&#8221; , but that isn&#8217;t my point. My point is that, man, 16-year-old me would <strong>hate </strong>34-year-old me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, in a long-since former life, I, my dad, and to an extent my mom, all worked for the guy who supplied their arcade machines in the pizza place&#8217;s &#8220;game room&#8221;. That&#8217;s how he knows us, because he&#8217;d see us at least once a week to collect the machines and give him his cut of the money they made. Sometimes it&#8217;d be a ton, sometimes it&#8217;d be barely $50 total for the whole room, but, we didn&#8217;t screw him on his money, like our boss would. And with this being Labor Day Weekend, they&#8217;re going to be hopping all weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that got me and my mom to talking about how we&#8217;d have taken care of his business had we actually been the ones making decisions back then. That pizza place, and a couple other locations that would have been our &#8220;Crown Jewels&#8221;, AKA, &#8220;the ones who get the absolute <strong>best </strong>machines, most detailed support, consistently checking in to make sure we <strong>keep</strong> them as a client&#8221;. Then it hit me, that the younger me, who had to be given the &#8220;if you aren&#8217;t going to work, you aren&#8217;t going to get paid, now let&#8217;s just go&#8221; from my dad back then, he would never have been like that. He&#8217;d have done&#8230;about the same as that old boss, only without snorting all the profits to support a pain pill habit. How that man even made it to 60-ish I will <strong>never</strong> know.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now, mid-30s me is kind of a workaholic, hell, I&#8217;m picking up a holiday shift and Saturday next week at work because I have nothing else going on. Teenage me most certainly was not like that. We only got paid a little bit more than gas money back then, so, that carrot on the stick was pretty small, and Final Fantasy XI was well into its heyday as well, so, I wanted to spend <strong>every</strong> waking moment in front of the Xbox 360 playing it. I didn&#8217;t want to work, or do chores, or run errands, or do yard work, no. I wanted to sit and play this game until my eyes bled, and then play some more. That isn&#8217;t a good way to start a career, even if it&#8217;s under-the-table because I was in high school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until mid-college that I actually started getting myself in gear to do class work, actually <strong>go </strong>to work and class, not be a lazy piece of crap at my best. Sure, my grades in high school were great, but I didn&#8217;t have to try. College, and the actual working world where I didn&#8217;t get to set my hours, that made me have to knuckle down, and drag myself across the line to get things done when I didn&#8217;t want to. That, eventually became just doing it when it came up instead of just putting in the bare minimum of effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, thinking about going to collect the machines from that pizza place, or the resort we had machines at, especially on a holiday weekend? 34-year-old me would have been hounding 16-year-old me as hard as my dad did back then. That&#8217;s the biggest clients we have, you can play games <strong>later</strong>, we take care of these guys, end of story. Grab your wallet, your shoes and let&#8217;s get going.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Me now would have had a gameplan for what clients we collect each day, what vending machines we did restocks on, and wedge in slack time to go do repairs for clients that needed an arcade cabinet fixed. We&#8217;d be cross-referencing clients&#8217; operating days and hours, and determine our route for the day based on that information. Go service locations A/B/C/D on Monday, D/E/F on Tuesday, G/H/I and penciling in replacing a coin chute on a location at C on Wednesday, and so on. My younger self would have thrown a fit at me, but, running a successful, sustainable business means you have to get up and do the work. I know how I was, a moody, snippy little prick, and me now has no time or patience for that nonsense. Me now has a schedule, a routine, and a laundry list of things that need done each day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That pizza shop? We&#8217;ve known the owners for 20+ years, I went to school with their daughter/granddaughter (the other owner is that guy&#8217;s father-in-law). We moved a pizza oven into a location they were setting up pro-bono (and I witnessed them arguing about the logistics of it in Spanish saying a lot of words my teacher at the time wouldn&#8217;t teach us), even now, years after that old boss and that shop broke things off, he asks how my dad is. Like, if he needed us for anything, we&#8217;d probably help out no questions asked. That isn&#8217;t something you develop without actually caring for the client, without actually getting up and going when they call with a problem. That&#8217;s where past and present me would have our biggest clash of heads. He both didn&#8217;t, nor did he want to try. I don&#8217;t necessarily <strong>want </strong>to have to try, but, it&#8217;s gotta be done, and no one else is coming, it <strong>has </strong>to be me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have to work tomorrow, but, I&#8217;ve got things to keep me busy. I&#8217;m on the hook for going to buy mums tomorrow, which will distract me during the Ohio State/Texas game, it&#8217;s work, but it&#8217;s things that probably need to be handled now, when I have a minute, rather than later, when I don&#8217;t. That six-day week is going to crunch me for time next Saturday, so, I have plans for this one. We need paint for the living room, we&#8217;re going to get mums, and I have a yard to mow Sunday. My younger self would be dragging ass to get one of those things done, and while current me will be, it&#8217;ll be because he&#8217;s trying to get them all taken care of, instead of wanting to go inside and play games all day.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/29/blaugust2025-day-29-not-pleased-to-meet-me/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1996.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1996.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

So, I&#8217;m going to sit here, play my silly little games, watch my silly little cartoons, and try not to think too hard before work tomorrow. I also forgot to take my happy pill this morning, so, the comedown from that has me a little erratic right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like, I think I need a day occasionally where I don&#8217;t take my medicine, just to let myself feel all those emotions that the medicine represses, or I just repress because I&#8217;m a bundle of neuroses and unresolved traumatic incidents. Then the next day, I take my happy pill, and get right back into the saddle. It&#8217;s a nice balance, I think. A day where I throw double birds at my laptop screen all day and want to both cry and rip my own head off is a counterweight to not feeling much aside from &#8220;chill&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ripping off my own head was because of a case I &#8220;helped&#8221; on today, where the lowest priority support had an issue that I sniffed out in a few seconds. Then I became a teacher for five minutes trying to get this proverbial horse to drink after dragging it to the water. They&#8230;aren&#8217;t getting much better than this, are they? When even my Tier 3s are saying they have zero faith in this hiring class, it&#8217;s not been a fun time. God bless the three competent people down there playing Sisyphus&#8217; greatest hits every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I seem to be sitting in the dark writing instead of turning on my lamp for the evening. The goal is to make some headway in Xenoverse 2 tonight, maybe throw in some No Man&#8217;s Sky with its new update if I get time to. Very glad that tomorrow is Friday, because the two days I have off will be it before I go into a six-day week next week, with 16 hours of overtime. Gotta love holiday pay.

The client calls back while I&#8217;m at lunch, so someone on my team gets the call. Dear reader, do you know what she did with that call? Nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Okay, so, what did you do while you had him on the phone?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nothing, I&#8217;ve never seen it before so I don&#8217;t know how to fix it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You gotta be kidding me. Instead of remoting in, documenting the issue, you tell them I&#8217;ll call them back once I clock back in, and do nothing with it? Oh, they got their call, straight to their Voicemail. Still waiting on that call to be returned, by the way. If it comes in while I&#8217;m out for the evening, too bad. I&#8217;m off the clock, someone else can deal with it, it isn&#8217;t like I don&#8217;t take calls for their cases while they&#8217;re away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like, it&#8217;s frustrating to see. I get irritated when I get calls from other departments where the transfer notes are just my department&#8217;s three-letter designation in our call software. But, I&#8217;ve battled many times with many people over crappy documentation, I&#8217;m used to it. When someone on my own team gets a call and gives us nothing to work with? I was halfway towards flying off the handle, happy pills or no.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>There are some days where I really wonder <strong>why </strong>my job keeps me around, but, there are <strong>also </strong>days like today, where it becomes readily apparent that I am in fact, far better than I give myself credit for. I&#8217;ve repeated it a million times by now, but my notes are thorough, my documentation is there, if I see a problem, and I can work it, I will show what I did. I will explain why I did it, and give a rundown of the case for the next person to see the case. If I send something to another department, I will tell you <strong>exactly </strong>why I sent it, what my reason is, and what I want you to do. If I close a case, or dispatch it out, you will know my reasoning for what I&#8217;d done, because you can&#8217;t read my mind, and I can&#8217;t read yours either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see my own people doing the same shit I light into other departments for? I see red. What do you mean you didn&#8217;t put any notes into the case, even just to say you took a call on it and reporting what the client says!? Or when a case calls in, I get the call and the only update is someone telling the client to call us? What the hell kind of Customer Service is that!?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have gone to my boss, and every boss I have had in nine years on this subject, and the post-Covid, &#8220;everyone is permanently work-from-home&#8221; years has only made it worse. Those of us who are working towards moving up, you can tell what our work looks like, detailed notes, documentation of what was done, what our next steps should be. My cracking jokes about having nightmares that I&#8217;m late for work and crashing my car in a parking garage are not indicative of the quality of my work when it&#8217;s time <strong>to </strong>work. No, when it&#8217;s time to go, we go. I know my stuff, and I prove it with my case updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>I know, not everyone works like me, but that isn&#8217;t even my point! My point is that we owe it to the client to give them our best shot whenever they call in, or get them to who can. When my own people won&#8217;t even remote in and do the bare minimum of troubleshooting on an issue, it <strong>really </strong>burns me up. Because then it seems like we aren&#8217;t even trying. Which makes us as a team, as a company, look bad to those clients paying us a <strong>lot </strong>of money for our products and support for those products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took a call on this person&#8217;s case the day before, and resolved the issue in a few minutes. When I did, I noted down what I did, documented the steps I took to resolve the issue, and reiterated that in my closing notes. Not because I was trying to style on them, but because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m <strong>supposed</strong> to do, and also to give them notes on how to fix that issue the next time they see it. Because that&#8217;s how I have my little note repository, I take those fixes, write them out, and save them! My notes go back nine years, and I&#8217;m <strong>still</strong> sorting through them to through into my OneNote book for work!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not asking for the world, I&#8217;m asking for basic competence from the people on my team. Some of us are more than pulling our weight, doing all those things that are expected to adequately take care of a client, while others are doing the bare minimum and only succeeding at frustrating us, and the customer. You take a call, work it as best you can, and note what you did! That&#8217;s all I ask! It should not be this much of an issue!</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/27/blaugust2025-day-27-show-your-work/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/img_1809.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/img_1809.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

And surprisingly, it&#8217;s one I should have seen a million miles away, and he <strong>yammed </strong>it home with the concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, out of all the characters I&#8217;ve created for my little car-crash setting of the &#8220;Alterverse&#8221;, my personal little fanfiction-adjacent playground for ideas, Eoghanan is my personal favorite. He&#8217;s the ideal me in my mind, was a legitimate baseball prospect at Shortstop in high school, became an adventurer and knight, married his high school sweetheart, works as a teacher because he wants to help raise up the next generations, he&#8217;s everything I wanted to be growing up. He&#8217;s gone through a lot in his life, lost friends to violence, been taken captive, nearly lost the love of his life, but has pulled through to survive and help others. But what happens when you rip it all away? What happens when all those things that ground him, all those people who mold him into who he is, what happens when you tear them all away? That&#8217;s a question my brother asked, and hit a home run (to push the baseball metaphor harder) with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He asked the question, &#8220;what if Eoghanan was raised into Undeath as a Death Knight?&#8221;, which lead to a perfect title for him, &#8220;The Death Rider&#8221;. He came up with it because I told him once that the current starting point for nearly 40-year-old Eoghanan is &#8220;what if Jon Moxley (pro wrestler) had a sword?&#8221;. The dry humor, the beginning of gravel to his voice, kind of adopting &#8220;Wild Thing&#8221; as a personal anthem, the springboard I use for him is just Mox. Not leader of &#8220;The Death Riders&#8221; Mox, but closer to Blackpool Combat Club, loose-cannon badass Mox. As he put in his autobiography, sort of a John McClane from Die Hard type.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>He set the table for that incarnation based on the Fractures In Time from World of Warcraft, where versions of characters from other timelines intersect with the main one. He started with the idea of Highlord Marnes, or &#8220;Deathlord Frostbane had he never been killed at Lordaeron&#8221;, and branched from there. He got to The Death Rider, and my mind went off. I started getting ideas of how we got here, what caused him to become a Death Knight, and what that timeline looks like because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So picture this, Legion, The Burning Shores. Designate Killjoy is called back in to counter the Burning Legion&#8217;s incursion on Azeroth. Our intrepid strike team ports in from Vana&#8217;Diel, not knowing The Horrors would await them. It doesn&#8217;t go well. Like in the main line, Highlord Tirion Fordring, King Varian, and Warchief Vol&#8217;Jin all fall on the shore. But it doesn&#8217;t end there. One by one, Killjoy is cut down by the Legion. Merrex, Rayder, Kate, Firewalker, Scarlet, Lance, and even Vera fall. Eoghanan is all that&#8217;s left. Blood pouring from his body, Scythe and Greatsword in hand, he steadies for his last hurrah, his last stand in a losing battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Army Of Light takes the Shore, the combined might of the various factions of Azeroth, and the full weight of the Galactic Federation behind them are just <strong>barely </strong>enough to win the day. But the cost is high. Deaths are in the thousands, Killjoy isn&#8217;t special in this case, squad after squad is wiped out entirely, as the Deathlord walks through the now quiet battlefield to try and begin to tally the dead, a hand clings to his boot. A voice weakly calling to him amidst the carnage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Deathlord! I-I know you can hear me! They&#8217;re dead! All of them!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Malone?&#8221; He crouches down to comfort the shellshocked knight. &#8220;How badly are you injured? Speak to me, stay with me boy!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to make it. I can&#8217;t move, I can&#8217;t feel my legs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pall washes over his face, he knows that this is the end of the line. A quiet look of acceptance and resignation as he accepts his death, and maybe, just maybe getting to see Vera again. As he closes his eyes and tries to drift off, all he can see is the image of the Burning Legion ending her life, again, and again. He seems them cutting down his friends, all with the same deranged look of glee and satisfaction, not even in the name of Sargeras. His eyes open, acceptance and resignation turned into anger and a need for vengeance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Marnes. I&#8217;m not going to make it. Will you&#8230;will you raise me as a Death Knight?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Samuel, you know not what you ask for, you know that your soul will not rest, even should we defeat the Legion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t care. She&#8217;s gone, Deathlord. They killed her. They killed all of them. I&#8217;m not going to make it off this beach either&#8230;I&#8217;m bleeding out, I can&#8217;t move. So please, let me be of some use.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Deathlord raises one of his Blades of the Fallen Prince, &#8220;&#8230;it shall be done.&#8221; The blade pierces Eoghanan&#8217;s heart, ending his suffering, as a blue swirl of energy emanates from his body and the sword.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a (very) rough setup for how he gets from Point A to Point B, but the general bones are there. Legion, but Everything Goes Badly. Once he&#8217;s raised into Undeath by Bolvar Fordragon, he becomes the Deathlord&#8217;s right hand, carrying a Rune Forged incarnation of Balmung into battle, leaning into the Blood discipline. From there, he scours the Broken Isles, becoming a one-man army of vengeance toward the Legion. Gone are the jokes, gone is the light-hearted nature, gone is the need to hold back on those who wronged him. He becomes a terror in his own right, carving bloody swathes through the demonic hordes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he crosses over to the main universe in Fractures, his counterparts are horrified at what he&#8217;s become. Meeting himself, main Eoghanan sees what he could have become had he lost those closest to him. Highlord Marnes is shocked at the level of violence that The Death Rider is willing to go to in order to battle back the Void. In his universe, the Legion took an immeasurable toll on all those who walked out the other side. Azeroth, and countless other planets bearing the scars of their war. Even main Frostbane is saddened that someone he&#8217;s seen grow as a soldier and as a man, would willingly set himself down this awful path in order to avenge those he&#8217;s lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t a final draft of that concept that my brother came up with. Not even close, but, it is something that I can mentally chew on, an idea that I can just go a little nuts with, because it doesn&#8217;t tie into my internal, overarching narrative. It doesn&#8217;t conflict with anything I consider &#8220;canon&#8221;, and can use it as a way to explore different themes and motivations for characters I thought I&#8217;d known for as long as I&#8217;ve been doing this. It&#8217;s a fun little narrative experiment that I can go on, and for once, I kind of have to hand it to my brother for jumping on a really fun concept.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/26/blaugust2025-day-26-lets-get-edgy/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_1520-1.png'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_1520-1.png', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}]}

I&#8217;m not great at it, seeing as I&#8217;m the slowest person in the room in terms of pure reaction speed, but, I&#8217;m kind of holding my own. I did manage to take the first actual boss down along with me in one run last night, so, technically I&#8217;ve beaten the first area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an Early Access game that just hit its EA release in the past week (as of time of writing), so, it&#8217;s missing a lot of things. Weapons, levels, parts of its story, but having followed Ultrakill&#8217;s development like I have, it isn&#8217;t a huge deal. I can play what&#8217;s there, the rest when it&#8217;s added, and a full run once it&#8217;s all out. The way it plays reminds me of Ultrakill as well, with having to play aggressively to keep topped up on health, a grapple that you use to throw objects at targets, and me having to tap dance on my mouse and keyboard to keep up. I like it, even if it is physically demanding for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5197" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1984.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, I only have two weapons, the pistol and assault rifle, but you can only take one with you on a run. To compensate for your lack of firearms, you get a sword, grenades that recharge after a few seconds, and the ability to gain abilities to shoot at enemies. While you&#8217;re on a run, you&#8217;ll gain upgrades to attach to yourself and your weapons, that you&#8217;ll keep for the duration of said run. What I found worked really well for me was using a chain-lightning ability, increased grenade range and damage, along with stacking 60+ percent recoil reduction on my rifle as I technically cleared the first area, albeit dying right as I killed the boss.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5201" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1981.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;s the game about so far? You are Subject 1473, thrown onto a train and dumped off in an apartment-looking holding cell. Before you drop into your first run, you drop down to a secret area under your room, where the previous Subject 1473 brings you up to speed on why you&#8217;re here. He&#8217;s dead. He&#8217;s a disembodied voice telling you plug a chip into your head from a skeleton. It&#8217;s fine, don&#8217;t worry about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5198" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1980.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You are&#8230;somewhere. Somewhere under the watchful eye of IDRIS, an AI overlord obsessed with &#8220;testing&#8221; his subjects. Sounds like GLaDOS, except IDRIS &#8220;tests&#8221; by making them fight through waves upon waves of machines. You aren&#8217;t the first, nor are you the last. The previous 1473 says you <strong>can</strong> escape, but only by fighting your way to freedom. May as well get started, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5199" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1979.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally you&#8217;ll be shifted from the area you&#8217;re in, to what seems like an office complex, for a &#8220;Voidaxis Industries&#8221;, seems kind of specific, almost like they had a hand in&#8230;whatever this is. Logs will occasionally be found that talk about the beginning of whatever crisis this is, or notes from other, less fortunate test subjects. I found one who told that she was going to hole up under a rock, and left whoever found the note a upgrade item. I didn&#8217;t see her, so either she&#8217;s Hide And Seek Grand Champion, or she also fell to the same thing as the previous 1473.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5200" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1982.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, what&#8217;s so interesting about it? Well, it&#8217;s not like every run is the same, you&#8217;ll have branching paths after certain islands in the area you&#8217;re in. You&#8217;ll fight, you&#8217;ll traverse, and occasionally be given the option of going one way towards say, an Item Chest, or a Corruption that you can take on to give yourself a better shot at better rewards, should you survive. Or you can see splits for say, an Obelisk that will give you something, in exchange for possibly damaging you or taking an upgrade away. Or you can get something as simple as a shop that lets you pick from a range of upgrades in exchange for Credits you&#8217;ll pick up from crates and enemies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5202" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1985.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also enhance your character with Decryptors to unlock upgrades on three separate trees, but you aren&#8217;t pigeonholed down one path at a time, or in any particular order. Then once unlocked, you can upgrade those upgrades with Voidium, a resource you pick up from chests and crates, that does persist between runs. I don&#8217;t have many upgrades unlocked, but the ones for increased health, and health back after completing an island are almost invaluable. The most recent runs I&#8217;ve played have gone down much, much smoother with more health, and being able to heal between fights.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5203" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1986.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of, how <strong>do</strong> you heal? Well, you heal by staggering enemies, which you can do a couple different ways. First, you can stagger them with those grenades that charge back up after a few seconds, or, the even more fun way, by using the Gravity Tether. The Tether, lets you grab objects (or debris from the environments you can wreak havoc upon) and hurl them at enemies. If you get certain upgrades, you can trigger elemental effects on Tether throws, like freezing anything that was hit. So, if you <strong>really</strong> felt like it, you could log a canister of explosives at a group, and on top of blowing them up, staggering them, you can <strong>also</strong> freeze them to pick them off and grab the health and ammunition that drops for your specialized bullets. Regular ammo? Infinite, the specialized stuff? You need to find more of, but that limit can be enhanced with upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, it&#8217;s a really fun game that I&#8217;m finding more and more things out about the more that I play it. I&#8217;m finding synergies with abilities, weapon mods, grenades, all that open up new ways to play it and progress further in the story. Being able to power slide through a group of enemies, throw a chain-lightning bolt, and then lob a grenade at those stunned targets, then zip back in with a sword and hack them up is a fun time any way you, uh, &#8220;cut&#8221; it (thank you, I&#8217;ll be here all week, tip your waiter). The ability to blow up a building full of enemies, then lob chunks of that blown-up building at who&#8217;s left is a huge power-fantasy moment that you can just do, no special tricks involved. Even some of the Gamble/Relocation rooms you can go to are pretty clever, especially one that I want to spoil, but won&#8217;t. The only hint I&#8217;ll give is &#8220;don&#8217;t blink&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5204" height="576" src="https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1983.jpg?w=1024" width="1024" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by the story so far with the game, I want to know who the last 1473 was, why I&#8217;m in whatever I&#8217;m in, what IDRIS is, all these things that I have questions about. Am I trapped in some kind of computer simulation? What&#8217;s the outside world look like? What is Voidaxis Industries, and what is their connection to IDRIS? I want to know, and they have me on the hook as to getting those answers because it&#8217;s all so vague and hazy at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add in that all of this is done by <strong>one guy</strong>, and I&#8217;m even more amazed at what developer Daniel Stubbington/Stubby Games has done so far, and I can&#8217;t wait to see the rest of the game. Because something like this, with a ton of intrigue, sci-fi weirdness, and questions I need answers for is <strong>so </strong>far up my alley that I bought the game without hesitation. I love FPS games that play with movement, and this game has it in spades. You move fast, you fight fast, you fight hard, and you have all these tricks that you can pull to even the odds in your favor, it&#8217;s a really fun time so far. I would most certainly recommend it to anyone who loves either genre.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2025/08/25/blaugust2025-day-25-void-breaker-impressions/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'media_thumbnail': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1987.jpg'}], 'href': '', 'media_content': [{'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1987.jpg', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8c99083f60d4aa0ceb8978c6efdb6625af912223a3ad80b500733b98ec5cef0e?s=96&d=identicon&r=G', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1984.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1981.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1980.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1979.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1982.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1985.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1986.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}, {'url': 'https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1983.jpg?w=1024', 'medium': 'image'}]}

Today, there’s <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank">an update about how ARC Raiders will handle character wipes</a>. The system is called <strong>Projects</strong> and is optional. It offers players who want to wipe their character and start over fresh the chance to do so—gaining some bragging rights and cosmetic rewards in the process. I think this is an interesting take on the topic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Many online action games with player progression systems have implemented the concept of “wipes” with the intent to reset everything back to even on a set cadence. The goal is to keep the game fresh for veteran players and ensure that newer players can enjoy the game without staring at a mountain of progress to get on equal footing with the veterans. This makes sense for dedicated veterans and new players alike but misses what is likely the biggest player group: what I call the “core gamer.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;These core gamers, like myself, can’t put massive hours per week into a game, and thus, games with wipes become less attractive because the destination never feels reachable. We are always stuck in the progression step, and while progression is an attractive feature in the games we play, it’s the persistence of that progression that’s the main draw in the first place. Restarting after a mandatory wipe just feels bad. My friend and I quit <strong>Once Human</strong>, a game we both were enjoying, after the first wipe we were subjected to. We found ourselves logging in the next day irritated at the prospect of cutting down a hundred trees and breaking up a hundred rocks again to set out on the same journey we had just felt we’d reached an established point in.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;ARC Raiders</strong> smartly acknowledges that players like me are a core audience for their game, and the Projects concept seems like a good middle ground for all player groups—veterans, newbies, and the core alike. I really like how they’ve framed their decision here:</p><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides. Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall. So, as we have done with several other mechanics, before mimicking other established mechanics, we’d like to try our own method. Ideally to the end that best suits ARC Raiders and a larger majority of its players."&nbsp;</i></blockquote><p></p><p>The main concept of the Projects is that their initiation is <strong>player-controlled</strong>. If I have time in my upcoming gaming schedule, I can opt to start the project, and that will reset my character; my efforts will then go into the project. If I want to play the game more casually, without dedicated time in the schedule, then I don\'t have to start the project; I just keep on with my persistent progression.</p>\n<p>There are still details to understand about how players on Projects interact with those that are not. I assume they will be mixed into matches to avoid creating a queue issue where players are waiting for matches to start. This would be ideal in my book, as it would mix players pursuing different goals into the same matches—and if there is anything ARC Raiders excels at, it’s player-versus-player confrontation.</p>\n<p>Also, it will be key to enabling friends to play together that those on a Project can still play with those that are not. There are likely some considerations to avoid abuse—where, if a project (as featured in the article) requires certain items, those items can\'t just be given to a player by another player dropping them in a match. But the death knell for this type of system and game would be creating a barrier to friends playing together, so I can\'t imagine they\'d block players based on Project status.</p>\n<p>The one area I expect to be a hot topic is rewards. As noted in the post, the intent is for Projects to have a non–game-impacting reward structure. So, no combat bonuses just because you finished a project and another player did not. For some players, that may be a reason to question why they would even participate in a project if the reward is only intangible stuff like cosmetics or bragging rights. But just like the element of how wipes don’t respect the time of many players, giving those that complete Projects an advantage would also be a problem for those same players. I suspect that player group is larger than those that want an advantage for completing a Project. Lots of us “core gamers” love our cosmetics and bragging rights when we have the time to work on them and aren’t forced into them.</p>\n<p>Overall, I like what I see here.

Today, there’s <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank">an update about how ARC Raiders will handle character wipes</a>. The system is called <strong>Projects</strong> and is optional. It offers players who want to wipe their character and start over fresh the chance to do so—gaining some bragging rights and cosmetic rewards in the process. I think this is an interesting take on the topic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Many online action games with player progression systems have implemented the concept of “wipes” with the intent to reset everything back to even on a set cadence. The goal is to keep the game fresh for veteran players and ensure that newer players can enjoy the game without staring at a mountain of progress to get on equal footing with the veterans. This makes sense for dedicated veterans and new players alike but misses what is likely the biggest player group: what I call the “core gamer.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;These core gamers, like myself, can’t put massive hours per week into a game, and thus, games with wipes become less attractive because the destination never feels reachable. We are always stuck in the progression step, and while progression is an attractive feature in the games we play, it’s the persistence of that progression that’s the main draw in the first place. Restarting after a mandatory wipe just feels bad. My friend and I quit <strong>Once Human</strong>, a game we both were enjoying, after the first wipe we were subjected to. We found ourselves logging in the next day irritated at the prospect of cutting down a hundred trees and breaking up a hundred rocks again to set out on the same journey we had just felt we’d reached an established point in.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;ARC Raiders</strong> smartly acknowledges that players like me are a core audience for their game, and the Projects concept seems like a good middle ground for all player groups—veterans, newbies, and the core alike. I really like how they’ve framed their decision here:</p><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides. Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall. So, as we have done with several other mechanics, before mimicking other established mechanics, we’d like to try our own method. Ideally to the end that best suits ARC Raiders and a larger majority of its players."&nbsp;</i></blockquote><p></p><p>The main concept of the Projects is that their initiation is <strong>player-controlled</strong>. If I have time in my upcoming gaming schedule, I can opt to start the project, and that will reset my character; my efforts will then go into the project. If I want to play the game more casually, without dedicated time in the schedule, then I don\'t have to start the project; I just keep on with my persistent progression.</p>\n<p>There are still details to understand about how players on Projects interact with those that are not. I assume they will be mixed into matches to avoid creating a queue issue where players are waiting for matches to start. This would be ideal in my book, as it would mix players pursuing different goals into the same matches—and if there is anything ARC Raiders excels at, it’s player-versus-player confrontation.</p>\n<p>Also, it will be key to enabling friends to play together that those on a Project can still play with those that are not. There are likely some considerations to avoid abuse—where, if a project (as featured in the article) requires certain items, those items can\'t just be given to a player by another player dropping them in a match. But the death knell for this type of system and game would be creating a barrier to friends playing together, so I can\'t imagine they\'d block players based on Project status.</p>\n<p>The one area I expect to be a hot topic is rewards. As noted in the post, the intent is for Projects to have a non–game-impacting reward structure. So, no combat bonuses just because you finished a project and another player did not. For some players, that may be a reason to question why they would even participate in a project if the reward is only intangible stuff like cosmetics or bragging rights. But just like the element of how wipes don’t respect the time of many players, giving those that complete Projects an advantage would also be a problem for those same players. I suspect that player group is larger than those that want an advantage for completing a Project. Lots of us “core gamers” love our cosmetics and bragging rights when we have the time to work on them and aren’t forced into them.</p>\n<p>Overall, I like what I see here. There are lots of details to be felt out, and there will be questions about how fast and effectively new projects can be brought in. Even though the core gamers don’t want wipes, they do want fresh and new content—and a subset of us will be starting every project that comes down the pipeline. Veterans will sweat out every one of them, and new players will jump in and join us on the same journey!</p>', 'links': [{'href': 'http://www.heartlessgamer.com/feeds/2027077907162159803/comments/default', 'rel': 'replies', 'title': 'Post Comments', 'type': 'application/atom+xml'}, {'href': 'http://www.heartlessgamer.com/2025/10/arc-raiders-projects.html#comment-form', 'rel': 'replies', 'title': '0 Comments', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/13266751/posts/default/2027077907162159803', 'rel': 'edit', 'type': 'application/atom+xml'}, {'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/feeds/13266751/posts/default/2027077907162159803', 'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/atom+xml'}, {'href': 'http://www.heartlessgamer.com/2025/10/arc-raiders-projects.html', 'rel': 'alternate', 'title': 'ARC Raiders Projects', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'heartlessgamer', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/02809717223567961650', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'heartlessgamer', 'href': 'http://www.blogger.com/profile/02809717223567961650', 'email': 'noreply@blogger.com'}, 'href': '', 'author': 'heartlessgamer (noreply@blogger.com)', 'gd_image': {'height': '32', 'rel': 'http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail', 'src': '//blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfrHfTNjKaAn-j-xyGqY6L4_fdF2ODhbhSc664B9qvTQlBBV3IY3vxjvP1Asfpxcw8rKeNnXu3vQdJ6szvB4HvKpTGf7dUSML8w-mQz57SDKagnunydYEsqNhp3CLfK3hLcwoME_QOQGf5A8GNC1THAmNCDBR6loa_2-vRtaleOXdn9iA/s220/hgamerprofile.jpg', 'width': '32'}, 'media_thumbnail': [{'height': '72', 'url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtmy3oTH4LPO2oTPJk3EbnObj_nr9Gdq7kAjgWhm3VR2GUdg_md3iFNFusp7sUM3lOa7wkVUMAcFRs4mV78VK-RWInpf0JPvh5tsVqEKSxXCqdx-ZB_T_35WJHmFBBt6rtkDa7krBNlKr-_v-_AIR7T1Sn9hWNnStxFHZLbMG83osthDf6GjJdKQ/s72-w640-h360-c/ARCRaiders_CaravanScreenshot.png', 'width': '72'}], 'thr_total': '0'}

The map is cast in darkness and takes place around the crumbling facade of an old castle. The outer area is full of fountains and gardens. A web of caves snakes underneath, delivering players to different points of interest. The central capture point lies in the castle itself, where a broken staircase leads to an even more broken second floor. Players can look out at the surrounding area from multiple vantage points in the castle. It\'s a cool-looking map.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN_XbNyvbPb6JuQGXASP0HRmRV9J-y4Y_9XpKA3w4zyI9fkeMubDqIDeH9BnEeREGXEauqpGUSkUIq4Wa2BBsNkR1rDmFFQKtzXwiStsvtFbR4nu8u8g9cUFYdiWZbW5sJBVPRXLzJ_pM2Wf1TG22LYRrh4yxK32DyY6z09612BQaRn91BJqBa0g/s1901/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-23-18%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN_XbNyvbPb6JuQGXASP0HRmRV9J-y4Y_9XpKA3w4zyI9fkeMubDqIDeH9BnEeREGXEauqpGUSkUIq4Wa2BBsNkR1rDmFFQKtzXwiStsvtFbR4nu8u8g9cUFYdiWZbW5sJBVPRXLzJ_pM2Wf1TG22LYRrh4yxK32DyY6z09612BQaRn91BJqBa0g/w640-h360/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-23-18%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A look at the central castle and surrounding area.&nbsp; The map is much darker than the light in this picture would make you believe.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;With the cool looks comes a lot of clutter, though. There is a lot of uneven terrain where rubble is strewn about or blocks and pillars get in the way of traversal. I found myself constantly getting caught up on objects that blended into the background but protruded enough to stop me. I\'ve missed countless attacks where my target was slightly elevated on a stone or a stairway, or an invisible section of a set piece blocked a ranged attack. I think a pass through the map to reduce both visual and physical clutter would help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Optimization wasn\'t great either, with my frame rate tanking into the 40s/50s for most of the matches. It\'s worse inside tight indoor areas and better in the outdoor areas. Still playable and with no issues from network latency, so it just seems tied to graphical performance. I am sure this will be ironed out, and this is part of the reason they do preview events for new maps. We had the same issue with Coral Divide when it was previewed, and it was fixed up pretty well by the time it fully launched.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The map layout is confusing at first, but the more I played the more comfortable I was with it. It is similar to the Coral Divide map, where there are many avenues to move around in, yet you almost always end up at a choke point.

The map is cast in darkness and takes place around the crumbling facade of an old castle. The outer area is full of fountains and gardens. A web of caves snakes underneath, delivering players to different points of interest. The central capture point lies in the castle itself, where a broken staircase leads to an even more broken second floor. Players can look out at the surrounding area from multiple vantage points in the castle. It\'s a cool-looking map.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN_XbNyvbPb6JuQGXASP0HRmRV9J-y4Y_9XpKA3w4zyI9fkeMubDqIDeH9BnEeREGXEauqpGUSkUIq4Wa2BBsNkR1rDmFFQKtzXwiStsvtFbR4nu8u8g9cUFYdiWZbW5sJBVPRXLzJ_pM2Wf1TG22LYRrh4yxK32DyY6z09612BQaRn91BJqBa0g/s1901/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-23-18%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN_XbNyvbPb6JuQGXASP0HRmRV9J-y4Y_9XpKA3w4zyI9fkeMubDqIDeH9BnEeREGXEauqpGUSkUIq4Wa2BBsNkR1rDmFFQKtzXwiStsvtFbR4nu8u8g9cUFYdiWZbW5sJBVPRXLzJ_pM2Wf1TG22LYRrh4yxK32DyY6z09612BQaRn91BJqBa0g/w640-h360/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-23-18%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A look at the central castle and surrounding area.&nbsp; The map is much darker than the light in this picture would make you believe.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;With the cool looks comes a lot of clutter, though. There is a lot of uneven terrain where rubble is strewn about or blocks and pillars get in the way of traversal. I found myself constantly getting caught up on objects that blended into the background but protruded enough to stop me. I\'ve missed countless attacks where my target was slightly elevated on a stone or a stairway, or an invisible section of a set piece blocked a ranged attack. I think a pass through the map to reduce both visual and physical clutter would help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Optimization wasn\'t great either, with my frame rate tanking into the 40s/50s for most of the matches. It\'s worse inside tight indoor areas and better in the outdoor areas. Still playable and with no issues from network latency, so it just seems tied to graphical performance. I am sure this will be ironed out, and this is part of the reason they do preview events for new maps. We had the same issue with Coral Divide when it was previewed, and it was fixed up pretty well by the time it fully launched.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The map layout is confusing at first, but the more I played the more comfortable I was with it. It is similar to the Coral Divide map, where there are many avenues to move around in, yet you almost always end up at a choke point. With that said, I can see the map being challenging for more casual players, and I think the layout has definitely caused some players to get lost and miss out on contributing to the match. There are some choke-point areas near the spawns, so I\'ve seen a good bit of spawn camping in lopsided matches. If they do a pass to clean up clutter, I think they can also do some work to create more varied paths out of spawn.</p><p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ7hS1YNwJqD09ZKYVtK1RbZB3AO6ffHa07It3lkTP6TGpsvXpkjOeYomZm3Ng53H9OwVphmI6lG3y7nSjkcu2G1RlLxGCz36INoTmDE8jD11awuyqlEofP9tUe-5jKg5fb-XpV8PrkscZLVTYOPa_qz1uNjcwtl_aFArGliCpznndOXWqQrOyQA/s1901/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-25-25%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ7hS1YNwJqD09ZKYVtK1RbZB3AO6ffHa07It3lkTP6TGpsvXpkjOeYomZm3Ng53H9OwVphmI6lG3y7nSjkcu2G1RlLxGCz36INoTmDE8jD11awuyqlEofP9tUe-5jKg5fb-XpV8PrkscZLVTYOPa_qz1uNjcwtl_aFArGliCpznndOXWqQrOyQA/w640-h360/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20at%2011-25-25%20Outpost%20Rush%20Map%20Preview%20Tower%20of%20Calomel%20-%20News%20Official%20New%20World%20Aeternum%20Website.png" title="A screenshot from New world Aeternum of the new OPR map Tower of Calomel" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Jump pad on the right.&nbsp; Another look at the map.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Jump pads have also been introduced to OPR; previously, they were only used on the capture the flag maps.
