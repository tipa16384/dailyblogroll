Stargrace’s WoW gold log: 4.4 million this week thanks to better sales as Remix ends, mostly pets/transmog/recipes, plus a side quest of spending big on housing collectibles and letting auctions lapse

Syp hits level 20 on a TBC Shaman in WoW Classic, raves about Joana’s in-game leveling guide and friendly small-scale community moments, then groans at the marathon water totem quest.

Roger commits to a magic build in Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon and is pleasantly surprised it’s not just glass-cannon stuff—spells, cubes, and wands can put out DPS and stay alive.

Nimgimli finally finishes Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and loves it—if you play it in focused bursts—because the dodge/parry timing skills get rusty fast, especially across Xbox vs PC.

Kimimi’s Resident Evil Village write-up is more diary than review, riffing on the Winters’ “post-hell” setup, the dark fairytale framing, and how the game’s vibe lands across chapters.
