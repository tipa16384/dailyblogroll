- **[nicole express](https://nicole.express/2026/put-your-clothes-back-on.html)** — Nicole explores the tech side of Japanese arcade mahjong—starting with Janputer—and why dedicated button panels (and a ton of them) make home play and MAME setups trickier than expected.
- **[Inventory Full](https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2026/01/arcane-vs-mighty-nein.html)** — Bhagpuss compares first seasons of Arcane and The Mighty Nein, and despite LoL skepticism, ends up calling Arcane one of the best-looking animated shows he’s ever seen.

## Writing
