## Tech

- **[Ongoing](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2026/01/14/Unicode-Properties)** — Tim Bray explains how adding Unicode character-property regex to Quamina nearly meant generating 1.5M lines of Go, so he parses the Unicode Character Database instead of Go’s outdated Unicode tables.
- **[usebox.net](https://www.usebox.net/jjm/blog/useboxwiki-source-code/)** — JJM open-sources UseboxWiki after shelving a private-by-necessity “wiki revival” project (thanks, AI crawlers), reflecting on git-backed pages, wiki principles, and maybe just using Gollum instead.
## Gaming

- **[Tobold's Blog](http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2026/01/emberheart.html)** — Tobold dives into Emberheart, a medium-weight worker-placement board game where stacked bids decide who drafts dragons, heroes, and more—balancing grunts vs specialists and running out of workers fast
- **[READ ONLY MEMO](https://readonlymemo.com/quest-64-recompiled-the-classic-rpg-like-youve-never-seen-it-before/)** — Wes spotlights Quest 64 Recompiled’s slick high-res PC glow-up, plus holiday tinkering with ShaderBeam and thoughts on pricey Nvidia Pulsar monitors for CRT-like motion clarity in retro games.
- **[Inventory Full](https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2026/01/cool-kids-club.html)** — Bhagpuss reminisces about old-school MMO beta excitement (hello, Anarchy Online) while answering Ashes of Creation and Stars Reach questionnaires with the honest verdict: “fine game, just not for me.”
## General

- **[Jamie Zawinski's Blog](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2026/01/the-dilbert-hole/)** — Jamie Zawinski admits Scott Adams permanently embedded a couple outrageous Dilbert-era phrases in his vocabulary, then sends you tumbling through a long chain of “previously” callbacks.
- **[Scopique](https://scopique.com/2026/01/14/grab-bag-for-january-14-2026/)** — Scopique falls into Star Trek fan-production rabbit holes and comes away impressed by Star Trek Continues’ pitch-perfect TOS look, iffy mimicry acting, and a surprisingly stacked roster of guest names
## Writing

- **[Tofutush's Blog](https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2025-12-15.html)** — Tofutush bounces off Notion and happily returns to Obsidian + Quartz, arguing good “cyber vibe,” Markdown, and strict content/style separation (plus satisfying save feedback) are what make writing 가능.
- **[A Pixel Nomad](https://pixelnomad.ca/2026/01/14/ats-midnight-beans-buckets/)** — Stargrace spins an American Truck Simulator-style night-haul vignette: soybeans to Logan, radio banter with Melanie Q hauling clamshell buckets, then back on the road to “disappoint another state.”
