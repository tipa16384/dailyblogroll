## Gaming

- **[Inventory Full](https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2026/01/baldurs-gate-3-its-just-game.html)** — Bhagpuss finds Baldur’s Gate 3 more Larian than classic Baldur’s Gate—addictive and intense, but episodic, slow to progress, and packed with talky quest sprawl.

- **[West Karana](https://westkarana.blog/2025/12/31/picotron-will-probably-not-make-me-rich-and-famous/)** — Tipa ports Sword for Hire from Python to Lua for Picotron, gets inspired by what others are building, and experiments with dithered scene transitions while wrestling cartridge-size limits.
- **[Leeks Cosy Corner](https://leekscosycorner.com/2026/01/05/upcoming-2026-releases/)** — Krista spotlights seven 2026 games she’s excited to try—mixing cozy-leaning indies with bigger names like Mario Tennis Fever and Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection.
- **[Kimimi the Game Eating She-Monster](https://kimimithegameeatingshemonster.com/2026/01/05/power-dolls-6-mission-failed/)** — Kimimi reviews Power Dolls 6’s shift to streamlined 3D mech action, but the foggy, sterile presentation and janky details (floating parts, limited dodging) sap the big-explosions fun.
- **[A Pixel Nomad](https://pixelnomad.ca/2026/01/05/wow-gold-making-week-1-2026/)** — Stargrace’s WoW gold-making week nets nearly 5M, led by an 800k+ Rich Purple Silk Shirt pattern, and she doubles down on server-arbitrage while keeping posting time manageable.
## Tech

## General

- **[An Archaeopteryx](https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2026-01-04-week-1-digest/)** — Anarchae’s week-one digest hits a new Panasonic hot water dispenser, returning to weekly qigong, and reading Otto Penzler’s female-detectives anthology (including a surprisingly light Christie).
- **[Life on the Wicked Stage](https://warnercrocker.com/2026/01/04/sunday-morning-reading-136/)** — Warner’s Sunday link roundup riffs on a wild Venezuela news weekend, propaganda and MAGA infighting, plus pieces on Grok/X abuse, enshittification-resistant internet ideas, and blogging’s comeback.
## Writing
