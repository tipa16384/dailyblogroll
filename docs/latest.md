## Gaming

- **[The Ancient Gaming Noob](https://tagn.wordpress.com/2026/01/22/enshrouded-celebrates-two-years-with-a-plan-for-1-0-in-the-autumn/)** — Wilhelm digs into Enshrouded’s sharper 2026 roadmap: spring 0.8 “adventure sharing,” then autumn 1.0 with QoL, optimization, combat upgrades, new content, and consoles.
- **[Aywren's Nook](https://aywren.com/2026/01/22/ffxiv-finishing-dawntrail-7-4-again)** — Aywren pushes another alt through FFXIV Dawntrail 7.4 on Dancer (for glam), praises Trusts and the new “pity mark,” and notes dungeons feel tougher than pre-Dawntrail.
- **[Kimimi the Game Eating She-Monster](https://kimimithegameeatingshemonster.com/2026/01/23/one-inch-tactics-this-was-supposed-to-be-something-new/)** — Kimimi finds One-Inch Tactics a streamlined Power Dolls-style hex tactics game with great onboarding, but so frictionless and repetitive it slides out of memory and mostly tests patience.
- **[Frostilyte Writes](https://frostilyte.ca/2026/01/20/blightstone-early-access-review/)** — Frostilyte reviews Blightstone in Steam Early Access: a gridless turn-based roguelike where systemic tricks (wet vs electric, cliffs vs non-flyers) make planning—and yeeting—delightful.
- **[Priest with a Cause](https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2026/01/midnight-pre-patch-impressions.html)** — Shintar’s WoW Midnight pre-patch takeaway: less “addon apocalypse” than feared, but the transmog revamp clown-suits her warband—and the new transmog UI even crashes her aging PC.
- **[RPG Codex](https://rpgcodex.net/article.php?id=12754)** — RPG Codex flags the release date news: GreedFall: The Dying World is set to arrive March 12th, for anyone tracking upcoming RPG launches.
- **[Scopique](https://scopique.com/2026/01/21/first-look-starrupture/)** — Scopique’s first hour with StarRupture says it loud: think Satisfactory-style automation with orbital launching, a snarky AI, and five competing corporations you can funnel production toward.
## Tech

- **[Scripting News](http://scripting.com/2026/01/22.html#a223702)** — Dave Winer riffs on ChatGPT as a practical image-editing sidekick, then pivots to politics, Canada importing Chinese EVs, and Apple’s “1984” déjà vu moments of tech upheaval.
## General

- **[Contains Moderate Peril](https://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2026/1/22/treasure-island-1990)** — Roger argues the 1990 Treasure Island is the rare adaptation that stays dark, violent, and faithful to Stevenson, sketching the plot from Captain Bones to Silver’s treacherous crew.
- **[Life on the Wicked Stage](https://warnercrocker.com/2026/01/22/history-is-often-unkind-to-comparisons/)** — Warner Crocker says “Nazi/Gestapo” comparisons miss the scarier point: America’s own history—Manifest Destiny and Jim Crow—helped inspire Nazi race laws, so we can’t outsource blame.
- **[CrazyKinux's Musings](http://www.crazykinux.ca/2026/01/le-grand-mort-beautiful-unsettling.html)** — CrazyKinux finally reads Le Grand Mort straight through (1–8), praising Mallié’s gorgeous “Petit Peuple” art and the slow-burn premise, while wishing the condensed finale had more breathing room.
## Writing

- **[Words Under My Name](https://wordsundermyname.wordpress.com/2026/01/22/1-22-2026-open-book/)** — Blockade85 rediscovers being a voracious reader by tearing through Dune on an e-reader at bedtime—great for the soul, terrible for sleep when the alarm’s set for 6:30am.
