## Gaming

- **[Tobold's Blog](http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2025/12/lightning-train-buying-on-pedigree.html)** — Tobold basically bought the board game Lightning Train on vibes (and Paul Dennen’s resume), and after unboxing and solo-testing, he’s super hyped for its bag-building plus 19th-century US railbuilding

## Writing

- **[An Archaeopteryx](https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2025-12-13-the-call-of-cthulhu/)** — Anarchae tries Lovecraft for the first time and kinda hates how the annotated edition won’t shut up, plus “The Rats in the Walls” hits way too hard and now rats-in-the-city news is ruining life.
