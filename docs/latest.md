## Gaming

- **[The Ancient Gaming Noob](https://tagn.wordpress.com/2026/01/26/between-expeditions-in-no-mans-sky/)** — Wilhelm wraps up five No Man’s Sky expeditions, then hits that sandbox whiplash—so many goals (bases, freighters, achievements), but no checklist, plus some base-building quirks and bugs.
- **[Dragonchasers](https://dragonchasers.com/2026/01/25/finally-finished-expedition-33/)** — Nimgimli finally finishes Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and loves it—if you play it in focused bursts—because the dodge/parry timing skills get rusty fast, especially across Xbox vs PC.
- **[Priest with a Cause](https://priestwithacause.blogspot.com/2026/01/a-futile-endeavour.html)** — Shintar tests WoW’s new housing endeavours and finds the real problem isn’t “two dailies,” it’s murky UI, diminishing returns, and progress so tiny it feels like you’re pushing a boulder alone.

- **[Bio Break](https://biobreak.wordpress.com/2026/01/26/wow-classic-20-levels-50-to-go/)** — Syp hits level 20 on a TBC Shaman in WoW Classic, raves about Joana’s in-game leveling guide and friendly small-scale community moments, then groans at the marathon water totem quest.
- **[Leeks Cosy Corner](https://leekscosycorner.com/2026/01/25/dokev-where-is-the-game-now/)** — Krista revisits Pearl Abyss’ DokeV—open-world creature-collecting with Korean folklore flair—and wonders where it went, since the big 2021 reveal still hasn’t turned into a release date.
