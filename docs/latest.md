## Gaming

- **[Inventory Full](https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2025/12/inventory-full-advent-calendar-2025-day_13.html)** — Bhagpuss’s Advent Calendar Day 13 is basically a quick music pick: “Christmas In Riverdale” by The Archies, like a tiny holiday vibe break mid-scroll.
- **[Scopique](https://scopique.com/2025/12/12/the-2025-video-game-awards/)** — Scopique speed-runs the 2025 VGAs (mostly for trailers), calling out stuff like The Free Shepherd, Exodus, Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, and Solasta II.
- **[The Ancient Gaming Noob](https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/12/12/guild-war-reforged-and-a-party-divided/)** — Wilhelm wrangles the very-2005 vibes of Guild Wars Reforged with friends—Steam installs, Prophecies confusion, chaotic character names, and finally grouping up in Ascalon anyway.
- **[In An Age](https://inanage.com/2025/12/12/review-nex-playground/)** — Azuriel reviews the Nex Playground motion console (kinda Kinect/Wii Sports but controller-free), breaks down the subscription costs, and says it’s probably worth it if your kids aren’t Fortnite-brain-
- **[Tales of the Aggronaut](https://aggronaut.com/2025/12/12/shadow-drop-paladin-and-game-awards/)** — Belghast watches The Game Awards for a Path of Exile II Twitch drop, then rage-loves Diablo IV shadow-dropping Paladin (preorder required) and starts rambling trailers like Control Resonant.
## Tech

- **[Scripting News](http://scripting.com/2025/12/12.html#a161156)** — Dave Winer muses about an alternate-history Twitter (WordPress-style), jokes about “Your Own Twitter” with AI actors, then nerds out on making custom APIs in WordLand/FeedLand.
- **[Jamie Zawinski's Blog](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2025/12/what-if-the-torment-nexus-was-fundamental-to-wordpress/)** — Jamie Zawinski is super not impressed with the idea of baking an AI/LLM straight into WordPress core, like a permanent “spicy autocomplete slop firehose” you can’t uninstall.
- **[An Archaeopteryx](https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/bearblog-theme-css-v16/)** — Anarchae drops a huge Bearblog CSS v16 update—link labels (like Youtube/Amazon), pagination, post lists by month/year, and site search—plus some nerdy CSS tricks with selectors and unicode.
## Writing

- **[Ready Pixel One](https://www.readypixelone.com/blog/shadowsstirsistersendure)** — Pixel One writes an in-world letter from Dornogal, with Windrunner-family drama (Alleria, Sylvanas, Vereesa) and weird “radiant song” visions pulling everyone toward Silvermoon.
## General

- **[Monsterlady's Diary](https://monsterladysdiary.wordpress.com/2025/12/12/hidden-gems/)** — Emily talks about Microsoft killing its movies/TV app, then finding surprisingly solid “hidden gem” streaming on CTV and CBC Gem—ads and all—while rewatching stuff like Schitt’s Creek.
- **[Contains Moderate Peril](https://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2025/12/11/a-year-in-social-media)** — Roger does a one-year check-in on juggling Twitter/X, Mastodon, and Bluesky, and basically decides the politics overload is wrecking the vibe so he’s stepping back (probably ditching X).
- **[Axxuy](https://axxuy.xyz/blog/posts/2025/a-busy-winter-day/)** — Axxuy speed-dumps a day-in-the-life: baking pumpkin stuff, messing with car tires, buying a Christmas tree, getting a date cancelled, and setting up music scrobbling—busy but kinda normal.
