- **[Inventory Full](https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/2026/01/yesterday-project-gorgon-today-project.html)** — Bhagpuss pokes holes in Google’s Project Genie hype: it’s not making real games, just fuzzy 60‑second interactive snippets, while the messy copyright/IP implications loom large.
- **[Time to Loot](https://www.timetoloot.com/blog/time-to-loot-turns-seven/)** — Naithin celebrates (a bit late) Time to Loot turning seven, digs into posts/comments/traffic stats, and looks ahead to 2026 hype—especially hoping Crimson Desert delivers after mixed Monster Hunter
- **[A Pixel Nomad](https://pixelnomad.ca/2026/01/29/eve-morning-calculations/)** — Stargrace captures quiet EVE Online wormhole life: coffee in a freeport, trusty Helios vs tempting Odysseus, and the J-space truth that flying something flashy can be an invitation to die.
- **[Tales of the Aggronaut](https://aggronaut.com/2026/01/30/gated-by-dumb/)** — Belghast’s Path of Exile Legacy of Phrecia 2.0 start is pure gauntlet chaos—dentist delays, Witch-mule gem shenanigans, brutal modifiers—and the facepalm reveal he ran level 1 gems to level 34
- **[Tobold's Blog](http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2026/02/enshrouded.html)** — Tobold is 85 hours deep in Enshrouded and loves how its voxel building, crafting, housing, and RPG adventuring feels like the MMO dream (UO/SWG-style) that WoW’s quest treadmill never delivered.
- **[Dragonchasers](https://dragonchasers.com/2026/01/31/january-2026/)** — Nimgimli’s January recap mixes storm prep with SSD-cleanup gaming: lots of My Time at Sandrock and Ball X Pit, bounced off Wasteland 3’s tone, finished Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and eyes Eternal
## Tech

- **[An Archaeopteryx](https://anarchaeopteryx.bearblog.dev/2026-01-31-linux-install-nobara/)** — Anarchae tries Nobara (Fedora 43) on a ROG Zephyrus G14 hoping for easy NVIDIA/asusctl wins, but ends up stuck in BIOS weirdness and “why won’t the GPU turn off” driver-manual purgatory.
- **[Jamie Zawinski's Blog](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2026/01/zipbomb-json/)** — Jamie Zawinski wants someone else to craft a maximally malicious “zipbomb JSON,” after his ~182‑million nesting-depth attempt hits parser limits—now it’s about balancing depth and array size for RAM
## General

## Writing

- **[Tofutush's Blog](https://tofutush.github.io/posts/2026-01-17.html)** — Tofutush riffs on the “self-insert Mary Sue” trope, admitting her self-inserts were mostly punching bags—tracking the evolution from a middle-school paracosm to Qibli in TIR, trauma and all.
