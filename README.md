# DailyBlogroll

DailyBlogroll is a simple Python tool that generates a "daily blogroll"â€”a curated list of links to gaming and tech blogs you follow. The project is designed to help you keep track of fresh content from your favorite blogs and share daily recommendations.

## Features

- **Automated Blogroll Generation:** Collects and compiles links from blogs you read into a daily list.
- **Customizable Sources:** Easily modify the list of blogs and feeds.
- **Focus on Gaming & Tech:** Tailored for enthusiasts who want up-to-date content in these niches.
- **Lightweight & Easy to Use:** Minimal dependencies, runs with Python.

## How It Works

The core logic is implemented in [`blogroll.py`](blogroll.py). The script fetches new posts from your configured blogs and assembles them into a daily digest.

To learn more about the details of the workflow, configuration, and blog sources, please refer to the documentation and comments in [`blogroll.py`](blogroll.py).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tipa16384/dailyblogroll.git
cd dailyblogroll
```

Install any required dependencies (see `blogroll.py` for details):

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run the script to generate your daily blogroll:

```sh
python blogroll.py
```

By default, the output will be printed to the console or written to a file (see options in `blogroll.py`). You can customize which blogs are included by editing the configuration section in `blogroll.py`.

## Configuration
